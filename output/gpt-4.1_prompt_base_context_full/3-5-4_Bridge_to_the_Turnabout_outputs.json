The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means \"7 Branched Sword\". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare... February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Hey, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah? What is it? Maya: You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you? Phoenix: Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all. Maya: But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right? Phoenix: Um... I guess so, yeah. Maya: Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up! Phoenix: (Pearls...?) Pearl: So! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick! Phoenix: ...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face? Pearl: It's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special! Phoenix: ...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.) Maya: \"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true! Phoenix: I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me. Maya: It's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training! Phoenix: (Now I definitely don't want to go...) Maya: You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there! Phoenix: Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious? Pearl: Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us! Maya: Yeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"! Phoenix: Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway. Maya: Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff! Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"? Pearl: No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall! Phoenix: ... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places. Maya: Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!? Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!? Phoenix: Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!? Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun... Maya: Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick? Phoenix: (Th-This girl... I-It's...!) Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence. Dahlia: Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me! Phoenix: But... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...) Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... I'll go. Maya: Huh...? Phoenix: Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go. Maya: Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!? Pearl: Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!? \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls. Phoenix: (Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.) February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Brrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick! Phoenix: Maybe you should put on something warmer for a change! Maya: W-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...) Pearl: Wow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple! Maya: P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo! ???: Well, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple! Maya: Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo! ???: Oh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold. Phoenix: What's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--! ???: Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside. Maya: Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass-- ???: Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. Bikini: I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini. Maya: B-B-B-Bikini...!? Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! Maya: It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Pearl: R-Reckless...? Maya: \"Wa ha ha\"...? Pearl: Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day. Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir√©e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! ‚ô™Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!‚ô™ Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask‚òÜDeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:¬†??? Time:¬†???Location:¬†??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record. Ami Fey statue (subsequent times) Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir.

Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim.

That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge.

(Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning. (Changed from [I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Edgeworth: (Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!) Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Oh my... Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...? Edgeworth: Apparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all. Iris: ... ...... Edgeworth: This is no time to be embarrassed! Iris: I-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing. Edgeworth: Worry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him! Iris: Does that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...? Edgeworth: ...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand. Iris: Sister Bikini... Edgeworth: She claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct? Iris: ... That is correct. It wasn't me. Edgeworth: ...Very well, then. Iris: Um... Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: You are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed... Edgeworth: Don't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements. (Changed from [Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.] in the original release) Iris: I-I see... (Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people. Iris: ... Edgeworth: But right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what my friend told me once. (Changed from [That's what a friend of mine told me once.] in the original release) Iris: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I simply ask that you watch and decide for yourself... (Changed from [You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide...] in the original release) ...whether or not I am fit to do the task I have been entrusted. (Changed from [...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.] in the original release) Iris: ... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands. February 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Judge: ...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Judge: I'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant... ???: ???: The prosecution... stands ready. Judge: A-And you are...? von Karma: Franziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy. Judge: V-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma? von Karma: ... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case. Judge: Y-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: I'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once... Edgeworth: ...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor. Judge: Ms. von Karma? Do you have anything to say? von Karma: ... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office. Judge: There... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack! von Karma: ...I told you, there is no such weakling! Judge: Wh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...I have no objection to the whip. Judge: Y-You don't...? Edgeworth: The prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today! von Karma: This promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers! Edgeworth: ...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic. Judge: Allow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah! von Karma: ...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible! von Karma: The murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue. Judge: The sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: There is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime. Judge: ...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand! Edgeworth: (And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!) von Karma: ...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please. Judge: H-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight! Edgeworth: If I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release) Judge: Bailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please! von Karma: ...Once again. Your name and occupation, please. Bikini: Little old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone. Judge: ... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah! von Karma: ...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once! Judge: Y-You want me to leave!? Bikini: No need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Edgeworth: In any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question. Bikini: That's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that... Judge: Let us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh! Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Judge: Hmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple? Bikini: ...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...) von Karma: There is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple...? Bikini: Well, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right? Judge: We'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam. Bikini: ...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training. Edgeworth: And how exactly do you help with this process...? Bikini: It is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising. von Karma: Like a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies. Edgeworth: (A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place? Bikini: Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Violently...? Bikini: That's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...? Bikini: That's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off! Bikini: So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You \"left Iris to help\"... With what? Bikini: What do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper. Judge: Wasn't it your place to remain with the disciple? Bikini: Well, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away. Edgeworth: Just to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct? Bikini: Yes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions. Present Iris's Testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all. Bikini: Well, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: In that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all! Bikini: N... No...! She said that...? von Karma: von Karma: A defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi. von Karma: ...! Bikini: But that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...! Judge: Hmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah! von Karma: ...All people lie. That is my belief. Judge: Why am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question... Bikini: Dear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you? Judge: A-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I... Bikini: My memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter! Judge: Then... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence. Edgeworth: ...Understood, Your Honor. (I was na√Øve to think that alone would do the trick.) Judge: Then please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination. Changes statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\" Bikini: Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure that you're not making a mistake...? Bikini: ...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor! Edgeworth: Nngh...! Bikini: Iris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake! Judge: ...An excellent finish there, witness. Edgeworth: (Still, I have to wonder...) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\" Bikini: There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath? Bikini: My back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all. Edgeworth: How long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking? Bikini: ... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind! Edgeworth: ...? Bikini: I bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones... Edgeworth: W-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah! von Karma: ...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth. Judge: The lowest of the low. Edgeworth: (Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?) Bikini: Anyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so... Bikini: It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The crime took place in the courtyard, correct...? Bikini: When you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard. von Karma: That's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case! Judge: Hmm... That certainly seems to be true. Edgeworth: (There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.) Edgeworth: ...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct? Bikini: Of course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute... von Karma: von Karma: H-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!? Edgeworth: That's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung. von Karma: W... What!? Edgeworth: ...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release) Bikini: Well well well! Edgeworth: (It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...) Judge: Order! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa! von Karma: ...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you? Bikini: Spares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them. Judge: I see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh? Bikini: Each nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned... Judge: Hmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah! von Karma: If there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here! Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: (I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.) Judge: ...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision. Bikini: I-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this... von Karma: Sister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple! Edgeworth: (Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.) Witness Testimony -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Judge: You saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that. Edgeworth: (This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...) von Karma: I would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours? Cross Examination -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple? Bikini: Let me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge. von Karma: Still, you never made it back there that night, did you? Bikini: T-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall... Bikini: And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you heard a noise...? Bikini: \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: ...That could only be the sound of the victim falling. Bikini: It's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that. Judge: But then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground? Bikini: ... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha... Judge: Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah! von Karma: The next one to laugh gets a whipping! Bikini: Well. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and... Bikini: Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims. Bikini: Hey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to... Edgeworth: The murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can! Bikini: Hmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time! Edgeworth: ...Please, don't keep us in suspense. Bikini: Her hood! von Karma: Her hood...? Bikini: That's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right? Edgeworth: ...Urk! von Karma: Hah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: What do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important? It's not important Edgeworth: (...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them. Judge: Hmm... Judge: Very well. ...Please, continue with your testimony. von Karma: Hmph... Leads back to cross-examination It's important Edgeworth: (This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony. von Karma: Heh... Miles Edgeworth. von Karma: If you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip! Judge: Witness. Add that statement to your testimony. Bikini: ...No problem. Adds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" Bikini: Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You are sure about that...? Bikini: Yes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it! Edgeworth: ...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself. Bikini: Anyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out. von Karma: Like me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip. Edgeworth: (At least then it might bite you and not someone else...) Bikini: Iris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it! Judge: ...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh. Bikini: Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct? Judge: Which means... the victim's room was on the second floor? Bikini: No, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building. Judge: I see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct? Bikini: Yes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all... Bikini: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What makes you so sure of all this...? Bikini: It's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: You're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height. Judge: Hmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then. Bikini: Yep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (There's only two of them working there...!) von Karma: What's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark? Edgeworth: ... Present Elise's Autopsy Report Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\" Edgeworth: (...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.) Edgeworth: ...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway. Bikini: Oh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter! Edgeworth: However... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report? von Karma: T-The autopsy report...? Edgeworth: The victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed. von Karma: Ah...! Judge: T-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here! Edgeworth: The scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!? von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree? von Karma: Th-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Were there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: She was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree? Judge: W-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room. Judge: ...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah! von Karma: I'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood. Judge: When it produces the most blood...? von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: Indeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound. Judge: That's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking! von Karma: We have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions! Judge: Order! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events! Edgeworth: (I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!) von Karma: ...Hmph... Judge: It seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate! Bikini: Don't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood! von Karma: Sister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here. Edgeworth: (...With the whip?) Bikini: ...Oh, boy. Alright, alright... Witness Testimony -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. I've never seen so much blood before... That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Judge: Hmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory... von Karma: Von Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...) Cross Examination -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time... was the victim bleeding? Bikini: Well... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then. von Karma: ...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound. Edgeworth: In any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!? Bikini: Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Think carefully. This is very important. Bikini: It's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.) von Karma: The victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out? Bikini: That's right... Bikini: The whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah... Judge: It goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding. von Karma: ...Nothing out of place here. Edgeworth: (Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.) Present Shichishito Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\" Bikini: I've never seen so much blood before... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood? Bikini: T-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too... von Karma: When the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner. Edgeworth: Wh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?) Judge: Hmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me... Edgeworth: (What should I do...? Press this point further?) Stop here Edgeworth: (I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding! Leads back to cross-examination Press further Edgeworth: Going back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...? Bikini: Well, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw. Judge: W-What did you see? Bikini: Maybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day. Edgeworth: Pulling the sword out...? Bikini: Well, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\". Judge: Witness! You will add this statement to your testimony! Bikini: Oh... Was that important...!? Edgeworth: (More important than you can imagine...) Adds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...? Bikini: No mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day! Edgeworth: ...Don't you think that's a bit odd? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Why would the killer pull out the sword? von Karma: What...? Edgeworth: If all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Indeed... It is strange, now that you mention it. Edgeworth: (I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...) von Karma: A-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness? Bikini: That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Now, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct? Bikini: Well... I was unconscious... von Karma: How long were you out for? Bikini: I don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually. Judge: Hmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation! Bikini: Well, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you. Edgeworth: ...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...? Bikini: And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct? Bikini: Just stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough. Bikini: But to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...! von Karma: Truly, a heinous, despicable crime. Edgeworth: It is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily... von Karma: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem? Edgeworth: Exactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that? von Karma: ...! Judge: Hmmmmm... No, I don't think I can. von Karma: ... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts! Bikini: That's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself... Edgeworth: (\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.) Edgeworth: (There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.) Edgeworth: Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here. Bikini: W-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. von Karma: What contradictions are you talking about? Edgeworth: In the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities! Judge: What do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah! von Karma: Explain yourself! Edgeworth: To start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that. von Karma: von Karma: \"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose! Judge: The objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly. von Karma: T-That's... Edgeworth: We also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: T-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction. Judge: Y-You've still got more!? Edgeworth: ...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it? von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: If this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword! von Karma: Noooooo! Judge: Order! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa! von Karma: Bravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that! Judge: But what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but... Edgeworth: ...Having come this far, there can only be one answer. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito! Judge: W-Whaaaaaaaaat!? von Karma: A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool. Edgeworth: Let's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon? Bikini: W-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it... Edgeworth: ...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah! von Karma: So maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object. Judge: Hmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises. Judge: The obvious... question? Edgeworth: ...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: It goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found. von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Answer the question, Ms. von Karma! von Karma: ... No evidence of that kind was found. Judge: Hmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast! Bikini: Excuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually... von Karma: ...What is it, Sister? Bikini: I was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there... Judge: ... What exactly are you going on aboot here? Bikini: The murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of! Edgeworth: You what!? von Karma: Well then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister. Edgeworth: (Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?) Witness Testimony -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Judge: Hmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time. Bikini: Well. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know. von Karma: Quite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph. Judge: A snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory... von Karma: The tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge! Tracks Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: ...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon! Edgeworth: (Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...You are sure about the time? Bikini: Yes... I was worried about it, after all. Judge: Why was that? Bikini: Because I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.) von Karma: Please continue, Sister. Bikini: And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct? Bikini: Right, right, the one who trampled me. Edgeworth: (It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...) Bikini: There isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him? Edgeworth: He had forgotten it at home, apparently. von Karma: What a na√Øve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too! Bikini: Anyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell. Bikini: And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited. Bikini: That's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls! Edgeworth: Now, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived? Bikini: Yes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate. von Karma: So... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time. Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?) Press further Edgeworth: (...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time? Bikini: Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean? Judge: What do you mean, eh? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used. Bikini: Ah! I see! I never thought of that! Judge: Hmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too! von Karma: ...Of course you did. Edgeworth: Then answer the question please, witness. Bikini: ... I don't often go around touching hot engines... Edgeworth: ...Hmm. Bikini: However... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it. Judge: Snow...? Bikini: Yes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow... Edgeworth: (There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!) Judge: It seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh! von Karma: How long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Stop here Edgeworth: (It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Judge: How long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Bikini: It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking. Bikini: Ah! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain? Judge: I think that's why the question was asked in the first place... Bikini: ...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch. Judge: Hmm... Crunch. Bikini: ...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then... Bikini: Anyway, the killer must have used it! Bikini: Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Refresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...? Bikini: Like I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes. von Karma: It's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile... Edgeworth: ...I have to concede that is more than enough time. von Karma: Is that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Bikini: ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: While it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here. Judge: Oh? And what would this mystery element be? Edgeworth: The killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods? Judge: Hmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah! von Karma: Turning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor. Judge: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (She's as over the top as always...) von Karma: A-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Edgeworth: (Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...) Edgeworth: I admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder. von Karma: You've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: However... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks? von Karma: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Iris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back. Bikini: ... Ah...! You're right! von Karma: Hmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...? von Karma: On the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it! Judge: I see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow. von Karma: What do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?) It's flawless. Edgeworth: ...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow. Edgeworth: I do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim. von Karma: ...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night? Bikini: Well... that would be...! von Karma: ...You can't hide it. I already know the answer. Bikini: ......... It could only be Iris. Judge: A-And the reason being...!? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. von Karma: A key... that the defendant is responsible for! Edgeworth: Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment. Judge: What is it, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: There is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim! Judge: ... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!? Edgeworth: Nngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!) Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" There is a contradiction. Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" Edgeworth: The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible. von Karma: ... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction? Edgeworth: ...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me. Judge: On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow! Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Witness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime. Bikini: Like I said! It was around 11. Edgeworth: ...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder. Judge: The... weather report...? Edgeworth: Snow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Therefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up! von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! Judge: Very well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things! Edgeworth: ... von Karma: Answer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!? Judge: Ah, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah! von Karma: Forecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM! Judge: Hmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh! Edgeworth: W-What!? (How did she pull that off!?) Judge: \"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this. Edgeworth: (I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony. von Karma: Hah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!? Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ... Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: It looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth... Edgeworth: ...! Judge: And to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry. Edgeworth: (This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.) von Karma: Respond! Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Even if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple! Leads back to: \"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\" Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Here is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...? Judge: ... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case. Edgeworth: ... Nothing else...? Judge: Nothing else. von Karma: Oh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Nngh...! Edgeworth: (According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!) Leads back to: \"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\" Edgeworth: Ultimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed... von Karma: That's right. But proving that is... Edgeworth: Incredibly easy. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: If we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why! von Karma: Gnnngh! Edgeworth: In other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks! von Karma: Aaaaah! Judge: Order! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah! von Karma: J-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing. von Karma: Of course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release) Edgeworth: Then when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained. Judge: Hmmmmm... Bikini: Can I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me... von Karma: ...What does, Sister? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. Edgeworth: ...! von Karma: Furthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder! Bikini: ...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple... Edgeworth: (But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...) Bikini: The snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot. Judge: ...That sounds right. Bikini: But... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge. von Karma: Y-You must have just failed to see it, Sister. Bikini: Maybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too... Edgeworth: B-But that... isn't possible! Judge: Order! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean? von Karma: ...Nngh... Edgeworth: So then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple! Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...) Judge: ... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release) Bikini: Yes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know. Judge: But then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile! Edgeworth: (A witness, huh...) Judge: Was there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night? Bikini: ... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do. Judge: Hmmmm... That's a shame. Edgeworth: (Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release) Judge: R-Really!? von Karma: ...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...? Edgeworth: I don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind. Judge: Which are...? Edgeworth: First... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder. von Karma: ...And the second being? Edgeworth: This individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!? Present Larry Butz profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: Just what is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth...? Are you saying that... this is the person who was near Dusky Bridge that night? Edgeworth: I-I did think so, however... Aaah! von Karma: You're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Cool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!) Judge: Hmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual... Did they really see the snowmobile that night? Leads back to: \"I don't know for sure if he saw it or not...\" Judge: This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"... Edgeworth: This is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim. Judge: Her student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder? Edgeworth: T-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason. von Karma: And so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw? Edgeworth: I intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom. Judge: Summon this youth as a witness immediately! von Karma: ... I have no choice, do I? Edgeworth: I believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him. Judge: ...Very well. Edgeworth: (Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!) Judge: ...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness. von Karma: ...Understood, Your Honor. Judge: Good... Well then! Court is now in recess! To be continued. February 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Excuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say... Edgeworth: Iris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene. Iris: ...Alright. I'll help you any way I can. Edgeworth: First, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: ...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile? Iris: ... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me. Edgeworth: So it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge? Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: Iris... Iris: I can't... tell you about that... yet. Edgeworth: \"Yet\"...? Iris: Not until her safety is confirmed... Edgeworth: Her? Iris: The safety of the acolyte... Edgeworth: (The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life. Edgeworth: ... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough. February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: ...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...? von Karma: During the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery. Edgeworth: Suspicious behavior...? von Karma: He was sketching something... Very intensely. Judge: Dare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained? von Karma: He drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip. Judge: ... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah! von Karma: Anyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here! Edgeworth: (It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...) Butz: Ouch! von Karma: ...Your sketch is in contempt of this court! Butz: H-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch! von Karma: You tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct? Butz: L-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\". Edgeworth: ...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...? Butz: I know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it? Judge: Working in the fields...? Edgeworth: I presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope. Butz: Th-That's it! Thanks, buddy! Edgeworth: (It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...) Butz: I just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model! von Karma: ... Butz: So see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Judge: Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Stop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man! Judge: Refrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now! Butz: Waaaah... This is almost too much for me...! Witness Testimony -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... I didn't see a s-snowmobile! I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) The girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me... I'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!? Judge: Witness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony! Butz: I-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!? Judge: ... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex. Edgeworth: ...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people! Butz: Yeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy! Judge: ...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time. Cross Examination -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Judge: What ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: This one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: So, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way. Butz: OK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a \"lodge\", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right? Edgeworth: ... von Karma: See? You can do it if you try. Butz: Heh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: ...There is only one issue here. What you saw at Dusky Bridge. Butz: I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"A number of times\"...? How many? Butz: Maybe... five times? I went once every twenty minutes. Edgeworth: Which means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night? Butz: You bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands! Judge: Love, you say...? Edgeworth: It was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter. Judge: B-Blackmail...!? Butz: No, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh! von Karma: You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness! Judge: So... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh! Butz: Um... well... You see... Edgeworth: (Being called those names doesn't seem to bother him at all...) Butz: I didn't see a s-snowmobile! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Larry! You really didn't see it? Butz: H-H-Hey! No need to hit your desk! I can hear you! ...I didn't see it! I didn't see a s-s-snowmobile! Edgeworth: ... Larry. Say \"snowmobile\" for me, please? Butz: S-S-S-Snowmobile. Edgeworth: If you truly have nothing to hide... ...then why are you stammering like you just flew over a cuckoo's nest!? Butz: Sh-Shut up! W-W-What is this!? I don't know! Don't ask me! Edgeworth: (It seems that I'll need to start from a more obvious contradiction. I'm going to strike the blow that will finally get him to spill the beans!) Butz: I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You didn't meet anyone? Butz: That's right. Because I've got nothing to do with this! And I'm just here to buy some viridian paint, OK!? Come on, I expect to see those crimson lake faces! Now! Judge: ... It would appear that simply pressing him isn't going to be enough, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry Butz...\" Edgeworth: (It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...) Edgeworth: Larry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble... Butz: I'm sorry...! Edgeworth: But... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction. Butz: Edgey! Are you... trying to console me? Judge: It certainly doesn't sound that way to me. Edgeworth: However... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create! Butz: Waaah... You're totally pinning this on me... Edgeworth: ...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz! Butz: ... That's right. Me, in the flesh. Judge: Hmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change! Butz: B-But...! What do you want me to do, then!? Edgeworth: Larry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well... Judge: I'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder? Witness Testimony -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. That's when I ran into Nick. Judge: Hmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you? von Karma: So... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire? Butz: It was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall. von Karma: W-What did you say!? Edgeworth: Oh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release) von Karma: ...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release) Judge: Now, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half? Butz: Well, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess. Judge: Hmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...? Butz: I set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too. Edgeworth: ...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end. von Karma: Because they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they? Butz: Shut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her. Butz: I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This \"light\" was, of course... Butz: Lightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah! von Karma: ...Or a little like that? Butz: Waaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda! Judge: Witness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge? Butz: Well, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so... Butz: I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Seeing that, what did you do? Butz: What do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart! von Karma: And that's why you went to take a look at the bridge? Butz: Well. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind. Judge: Hmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness. Butz: There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that? Butz: Hmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\" von Karma: How far is this small shack you were in from the bridge? Butz: Hold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk? Edgeworth: And how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there? Butz: Like I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare! Edgeworth: (...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?) Not right now. Edgeworth: (I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Why didn't you call anyone? Edgeworth: ...Larry. Let me ask you one thing. Butz: What is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face? Edgeworth: Why didn't you call anyone? Butz: Huh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Normally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct? Butz: ... Well, of course I thought of doing that. Judge: So then... let's hear why you didn't! Butz: H-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" Why did you go to the bridge? Edgeworth: So you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so? Butz: W-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there. Edgeworth: If that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning. Judge: In which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness! Butz: M-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" Butz: That's when I ran into Nick. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did Phoenix Wright look when you met him? Butz: Hmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment. von Karma: How far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge? Butz: On his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say. Judge: ...And that's when the murder was reported? Butz: That's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge! Butz: I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright? Butz: Y-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway. Edgeworth: (What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!) von Karma: It was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct? Butz: Yeah. That's pretty much it. More or less. Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\" Butz: I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you decided to go and see what was happening? Butz: That's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special? Edgeworth: (Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce \"spectacle\"?) Judge: Life seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt... Butz: Well, my motto is to \"hit life back as hard as I can.\" A-Agah! von Karma: ...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip. Edgeworth: (...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.) Edgeworth: Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not... Butz: What the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien! Edgeworth: But your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time. Butz: I've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those. Edgeworth: ...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct? Butz: Yeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less. Edgeworth: ...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM. Butz: ...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act. Edgeworth: That is impossible. von Karma: ...What do you mean? Edgeworth: 11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time! von Karma: ...! Butz: Ah! Excuse me! I-I have an objection! Judge: You do? Butz: Edgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah! von Karma: ...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that! Edgeworth: ...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM! von Karma: And why not!? Edgeworth: It is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM! Judge: Which means... what, exactly? Edgeworth: Wright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!? Butz: Urk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh! von Karma: ...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem! Butz: Yeah! Not much of a problem at all! Edgeworth: Really...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident? Judge: Yes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release) Edgeworth: And therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release) von Karma: Th-That's what it sounds like... Edgeworth: Ah, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude. Edgeworth: ...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time. Butz: Listen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!? Edgeworth: Y-Yes... Butz: I may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah! von Karma: ...Then say it! Judge: Very well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!? Witness Testimony -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Judge: Hmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk... Butz: That's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch! Edgeworth: (...Including the truth, from the sound of it!) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts? Edgeworth: Not at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains. Judge: And what would that be? Edgeworth: This is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him! Butz: Hah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey! Cross Examination -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tell us, Larry... Butz: My name is Laurice! Get it right! Mistakes like that are what keep you from being popular with the ladies like I am! Judge: ... Just who exactly are you!? Butz: I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Apprentice extraordinaire! Edgeworth: That's what he calls himself, in any case. Judge: ...Then you are... an artist? Butz: Of course! I'm an artist, the real thing! Edgeworth: Yet again, that's what he calls himself. von Karma: ...Names mean nothing. There is only one issue I care to discuss. What were you doing? Edgeworth: (That is a very big issue, indeed.) Butz: Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: S-Sketching!? The burning bridge? Butz: The burning bridge and everything that came with it! Edgeworth: ... What? \"Came with it\"...? Butz: You want to hear this from my lips, do you, Edgey!? Y-You'll regret this! That sketch of mine is... Gaaah! von Karma: ...Enough. Just take that ridiculous sketch of yours out already, witness! Butz: ... W-W-W-What are you talking about? I don't know what you mean! Judge: That does indeed appear to be the fastest solution. ...I'll leave it to you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (What should I do...? I've got a terrible feeling that the instant this sketch is revealed... ...the entire world may be changed by what is depicted there...!) Leave it alone Edgeworth: ...I cannot recommend looking at the sketch. His \"works of art\" are a force of nature best measured on the Richter scale. Butz: That's right! They'll shake your heart to pieces! Judge: Hmmmm... This courtroom has yet to meet earthquake standards! I think we'd better pass! ...In which case, let us turn to other leads. Leads back to cross-examination Look at the sketch Edgeworth: ...Larry. I wonder if you could show us your sketch. Please? Butz: ... Well, well... Even I couldn't have imagined it'd turn out like this. Edgeworth: ...Imagined what? Butz: That Laurice Deauxnim's debut would take place here, today, like this! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Show it! Now! Butz: OK... But steel yourselves! This... is the world of Laurice Deauxnim! Judge: ... Ah. Um... Well... So this... this is Dusky Bridge, correct? Q-Quite a large bridge, isn't it? Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Y-Yes, well... I-It's a better drawing than I expected. Butz: Isn't it? Isn't it? I struggled to reproduce those flames. I really did! Judge: ...Yes, I'm sure you did. ... von Karma: ...... Butz: ...... Edgeworth: (Nngh... This is going to get ugly... No one has the bravery to bring it up, it seems... This... mysterious flying object...) ...Larry. Butz: What? Edgeworth: The burning bridge is fine. But... What is that unfortunate looking figure...? Butz: Ah. You spotted that? I thought you might. Edgeworth: However much I might want to ignore it... I can't. Butz: It's Iris, of course! Iris! I wish she'd take better care of herself. We have to plan for our future, you know! What would've happened to her if she had injured herself flying like that...? Edgeworth: ... Larry, please. Answer this next question honestly. Butz: OK. Edgeworth: Are you REALLY claiming to have seen this? Are you claiming to have seen the silhouette of the defendant... ...flying over a bridge that was engulfed in flames...? Butz: Yep. That's what I saw. That's why I drew it! I'm an artist! A real artist! Edgeworth: Are...! von Karma: You...! Judge: High! The girl... She's really high up in this picture! Judge: Uwaaah! What was that for!? von Karma: ...This is all a bad dream. I was hitting you on the cheek to test that theory! Judge: Please whip your own cheek from now on if you wish to test your wild theories! A-Anyway! No court of law will ever acknowledge... ...that p-p-people can f-f-fly! von Karma: ...Actually, there is some precedent for this. Butz: She was flying pretty high, my sweet Iris. She was about 30 feet above the bridge, at least! It was really something to see! Judge: Th-This has to be some kind of m-m-mistake! ...Mr. Edgeworth, please bring the witness back down to earth! Edgeworth: What? Me...!? Judge: This witness is your friend, is he not? von Karma: \"Accessory to foolishness...\" ...Miles Edgeworth. Judge: Let us get back to the cross-examination! By force, if necessary! Mr. Edgeworth, I expect you to expose the obvious contradiction here! Edgeworth: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (Looks like I've got another reason to remember this moron...) Butz: ...Well, what did you think of my debut piece? Judge: Get that thing away from me! Larry's Sketch added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, hurry up and cross-examine him! Adds statement \"I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Could the reason you were so excited be...? Butz: What do you think!? My girlfriend was flying through the sky! Almost 30 feet above the bridge! I felt like I might start flying myself. Edgeworth: (If only you'd be so kind as to fly out of all of our lives...!) Butz: Anyway! I completely lost myself when I was drawing this scene! Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just where did you see this sight from!? Butz: Hey! No need to shout... When I was lying in bed in that run-down shack... The crack of the lightning bolt made me realize that the bridge was burning. I just watched it for a while from there, thinking how nicely it was burning! Then after about five minutes, I saw it. von Karma: The defendant \"flying\"...? Butz: That's right! That's when I decided to go to the bridge! Judge: ...I see. That all makes sense. Aside from the sketch itself... Edgeworth: (Yes... This sketch doesn't make any sense... I just need to convince the artist that his work is ludicrous.) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry. What did you really see that night...?\" Butz: The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The burning bridge moved you that much, did it? ...I find that hard to believe. Butz: You moron, Edgey! You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook! von Karma: An artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad! Butz: W-W-What has that got to do with anything!? Judge: I'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness. Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You transfered everything \"directly onto the page\"...? And that is this sketch here? Butz: Yep! Sensational, isn't it? Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway. von Karma: It did? Butz: That's right! The reason she didn't come to me, even though I waited for her... ...Was because she was trapped on the other side of the bridge! Judge: ... Butz: Could it be that Iris... ...undertook that dangerous, despereate flight in order to reach me...!? That's gotta be it! Alright! Go, me! Nice ooooooouch! von Karma: ...Continue. Please. Butz: ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot the passage of time to that extent, did you? Butz: Well... Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else... Edgeworth: (That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.) von Karma: Phoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts. Judge: Aside from doubts of his humanity, eh... Edgeworth: (There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!) Edgeworth: Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care. Butz: In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth! Edgeworth: If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain. Judge: What might that be...? Edgeworth: That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris! Butz: W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh! von Karma: A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim? Edgeworth: ...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct? Butz: Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah! von Karma: It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench. Edgeworth: ...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!? Butz: W-What are you talking about!? Edgeworth: ...I think you understand what I mean just fine. Butz: Why...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!? Edgeworth: What...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Butz: Edgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog! Judge: I do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage. Butz: ...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah! von Karma: ...What is it now, witness? Butz: It feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you! Edgeworth: W-What...!? Judge: What is the meaning of your outburst, witness!? Butz: ...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence. Edgeworth: \"Definitive\"...? von Karma: \"Evidence\"...? Butz: Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it! Judge: I didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality! Butz: ...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain! Edgeworth: (...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.) Witness Testimony -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Judge: A c-crystal sphere...!? Butz: This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers! von Karma: That sphere... Where did you find it? Butz: Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right. Edgeworth: And it was half-buried in the snow...? Butz: It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one! Butz: I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na√Øve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?)

Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask‚òÜDeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: ‚ô™No motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!‚ô™ ‚ô™...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...‚ô™ Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! ‚ô™Good cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...‚ô™ Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting¬†??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia...

She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you. (I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant secret left to unlock... Pearls's Psyche-Lock...) [sic] Revenge (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...?

Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: I think it's time you told the truth about what you were doing on that night. Iris: ... Phoenix: You said you were in your room at Hazakura Temple the entire time. Do you still claim that to be the truth? Iris: Yes... That's where I was. Phoenix: Iris... I believe you're innocent. That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder! Present Bikini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Iris!? I trust you, so you need to trust me. Iris: But, Mr. Wright... I can't. Phoenix: Why not? Iris: I can't trust such random nonsense! It doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I screwed up there...) Leads back to: \"Iris... I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... But mistakes just don't suit you. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: I had hoped you would get at least this much correct. I hate seeing you mess up and getting all disappointed. Phoenix: (Nngh... I didn't know she could be so harsh...) Phoenix: Iris, what are you trying to hide...? Iris: ...! Phoenix: The more you lie about it, the more I know it's got to be something really important. Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with?

Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" There were two of you. Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

Phoenix: (I think I've pretty much got all the evidence I need. Now I just need to find out what Pearls is hiding.) Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: I... After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?) Butz: It must've been pretty scary for you, Pearl. I know what it's like. Nick used to leave me behind when I fell asleep at school, too. Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure.

Phoenix: You went to this place for one very simple reason, and that is this: Present Maya Fey profile (after presenting Inner Temple) Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls.\" Otherwise Phoenix: Phoenix: Well Pearls? This is what you were worrying about, right? Pearl: ... There's something I'm worrying about right now, actually. Phoenix: What's that? Pearl: You, Mr. Nick. Your face has turned a really strange color. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You shouldn't work so hard, you know. You need to take a break once in a while. Phoenix: (...Being chided by a 9 year old. How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this! (I guess I'm going to have to think this through one more time from the very beginning.) Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: You knew the training Maya was undertaking was dangerous. After all, it was the Special Course. Pearl: ... Maya: I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why. The reason you were so worried about that bell was because of this: Present Burnt Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... You know, Mr. Nick, I think you should take a break now. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Even your hair's starting to look a bit tired. The spikes aren't looking so sharp. Phoenix: (Looks like picking this piece of evidence wasn't so sharp of me, either.) ...A-Anyway! You said you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell... Leads back to: \"Huh!? Oh! I...\" Phoenix: You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: I presume you recognize these pieces of paper? Pearl: Aaaaah! Wh-Where did you...? Phoenix: In the incinerator at the Inner Temple. Pearls... You were following the instructions in this letter that night, weren't you? That's why you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell. Pearl: I... I'm speechless, Mr. Nick! You're amazing! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: These instructions that were found in the incinerator... I believe they were written for you, Pearls. Pearl: For me!? I... No... Phoenix: As you can see, a large portion has been burnt... But the last section is still fairly legible. \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" Pearl: ... Phoenix: Who was it, Pearls? Whose spirit were you supposed to be channeling? Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: (Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it... ...whose spirit would Pearls have been trying to channel? Don't over-think it, Phoenix! It's pretty obvious who Pearls was supposed to channel...) The person you were trying to channel that night, Pearls, was... Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Pearls? Am I right? Pearl: I... I can't channel anyone anymore. Pearl: A spirit medium who can't channel spirits... is like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: (Poor kid. It's really getting her down.) Pearl: But... I have never channeled that person's spirit! Phoenix: (I should have all the evidence I need, so what am I not getting here...?) Leads back to: \"Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it...\" Phoenix: It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter. Pearl: Ah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (It's just as I suspected... It wasn't Iris who Sister Bikini met at the Inner Temple that night... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Do you know anything about her, Pearls? Do you know what kind of a woman Dahlia Hawthorne was? Pearl: Umm... no. I've never heard of anyone by that name before reading those instructions... Phoenix: (I thought so. Pearls doesn't have a clue. She doesn't know that Dahlia is her sister...) About the instructions in the letter I found, Pearls... Who wrote them? Pearl: Umm... Phoenix: Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of... You must have quite a lot of respect for them. Pearl: ... Phoenix: After all, you followed their instructions without question. So here's my next question. Who wrote this set of instructions for you to follow...? Present Morgan Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Pearls... I have to wonder about something...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the person who wrote the instructions, isn't it Pearls? You must have had a lot of faith in them to follow their instructions to a tee! Pearl: ... I... I had a lot of faith... in you, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Oh! Thanks! Pearl: But... ...I don't think I can trust you anymore. Phoenix: (Ouch... Pearls sure can be blunt when she wants to be... Alright now, think! Someone who Pearls would trust, no questions asked... There can't be many candidates for that post.) Leads back to: \"Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of...\" Phoenix: Pearls... I have to wonder about something... You didn't have any idea what these instructions meant, did you? Pearl: ...*ba-dump* Phoenix: But you followed them to the letter regardless. Why? Because it was your own mother who asked you. That's why. Pearl: H-How did you...? Phoenix: I figured it out. The person who wrote you this letter was your own mother, Morgan Fey! Pearl: Uh... Waaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Alright, Pearls! It's time you started telling me the truth. Pearl: M-M-Mr. N-Nick... I-I-I... Phoenix: (Why's she holding back from me? I don't like this...) Pearl: D-D-Don't underestimate m-me, j-just because I'm a ch-child! Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: If you're trying to say I followed these instructions... I'd l-like to see some proof! Phoenix: Whaaaat!? Pearl: Because... I... I d-don't think y-y-you have a-a-any! Phoenix: Nnnnnngh... (She'd say anything rather than admit to carrying out those instructions... I guess I'll have to produce some more evidence, then. One more thing should do it.) ...Alright, Pearls. We both know someone carried out these instructions on the night of the murder. But you're right. There's no evidence that proves it was you. Pearl: I-I-I knew it! Phoenix: However... I do know that whoever did it was a child. Pearl: Huh? H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: It couldn't have been an adult... No adult would've made a simple mistake like that. Pearl: A... simple mistake? What do you mean by that? Phoenix: I'm sure you thought you were carefully following the instructions you'd been given. But you misunderstood some of the words, and this is the evidence that proves it! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This shows the mistake you made! Pearl: ... Umm... I guess you know what I'm about to say, huh? I don't think it's me who made a mistake, Mr. Nick. It's you. Phoenix: (But the person who read these instructions must have been a child. That's why they misunderstood the meaning of that word... It's the only explanation for how such a simple mistake could've been made!) OK, Pearls. I'll go over it again. The person who read these instructions... Leads back to: \"It couldn't have been an adult...\" Phoenix: It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Wh-What!? Wh-Why would I d-do something like...? Phoenix: Do you remember what was written in that letter? \"Gravely roast the Master in the fires of Hades and bring our vengeance to fruition.\" But you didn't know how to read the words \"gravely\" and \"roast\" among others, right? Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea... Phoenix: Just a tiny bit. Pearl: I... I really am useless! I couldn't even burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me... (Changed from [I didn't even manage to burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me...] in the original release) Such a simple thing... And I couldn't even do it right... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful After clearing \"The night of the crime\" and \"Morgan's letter\" Talk options: Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. You really helped me out. Pearl: You're very welcome! My mother is watching over us! So I'm sure Mystic Maya will be alright! Phoenix: ... (Look at that innocent smile on her face. What am I supposed to say to her?) ???: Ha...! Godot: Finally figured it out, have you, Trite? You've finally realized how terrible of a crime being painfully oblivious is. Phoenix: G-Godot! Godot: The entrance to the Sacred Cavern looks like a freaking puzzle workshop. Phoenix: (I guess he's talking about Iris and the lock-breaking effort...) Godot: ...But it's all a waste of time. Phoenix: W-Why do you say that? Godot: Because Maya Fey isn't coming back. Phoenix: What? You don't know what you're talking about! How can you say something like that? Godot: It was your job to protect her, Trite. Just like it was your job to protect Mia Fey... Two sisters, caught up in the worst circumstances. Phoenix: I... I realize that, but... Godot: And you were the only one who was by their sides. You were the only one who could have saved them. Phoenix: But I didn't know anything about what was going on! Godot: Ha...! What did I just say, Trite? Being oblivious is a heinous crime in itself. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Tomorrow... We'll settle everything in court tomorrow. ...Once and for all. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick... Is... Is what that man just said true? Phoenix: It'll be alright, Pearls. I'm sure Maya's alive. You'll see for yourself tomorrow! Pearl: I... Yeah! That's right! I know I can trust you, Mr. Nick! Morgan: ...My dear Pearl... ...You've done so well, my child. My Pearl... ...It's better that you don't know what you've done...

Are you by yourself?Phoenix: Ah... Morning, Pearls.Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! Please tell me! What's going to happen to Mystic Maya?Phoenix: I'm sorry... We don't know yet. The investigation is still going on, so I wasn't allowed into the Inner Temple.Pearl: Oh, I see... So is Sister Iris still trying to remove those trick locks in the Training Hall?Phoenix: No... She's the defendant in this case, so she can't be at the Inner Temple. She's required to be here in court.Pearl: Um... Then... How come she's not here in the defendant's lobby?Phoenix: (I have to admit it's kinda strange...)???: ...If you're looking for Iris, she's in the prosecutor's lobby.Phoenix: ...Ed-Edgeworth. What's Iris doing over there?Edgeworth: She's going over today's testimony with the prosecutor as we speak.Phoenix: Today's testimony...?Edgeworth: You heard me... Iris is going to be testifying as a witness for the prosecution.Phoenix: Wait, what!?Edgeworth: The prosecutor is squeezing her for a confession. ...Or so I heard.Phoenix: (Franziska von Karma... What are you up to...?)Edgeworth: I know what you're thinking, but Franziska isn't going to be the prosecutor today.Phoenix: What...!? Then who is?Edgeworth: Who else would it be but Godot?Phoenix: G-Godot...Edgeworth: ...Franziska is engaged in some important work at the Sacred Cavern.Pearl: The Sacred Cavern...? You don't mean that she's...Edgeworth: Exactly. She has been out there all night, trying to remove those trick locks. With the head nun's assistance, naturally. We estimate that the last of the locks should be taken care of in about three hours. I hope everything continues to go smoothly and we receive some good news soon.Phoenix: Yeah... Thanks, Edgeworth.Edgeworth: Prosecutor Godot intends to nail this case shut today. Be prepared to fight like there's no tomorrow!Phoenix: ...You don't have to tell me that.Edgeworth: Touch√©. I can already see it in your eyes. (Changed from [I know. I can already see it in your eyes.] in the original release) You're not the same fever-ridden, frantic maniac you were yesterday.Phoenix: It's strange... On the way here, I decided that today would be the end of all this. Almost immediately after I made that decision, I felt myself getting stronger.Edgeworth: Interesting... Maybe you've passed your cold onto someone else, literally. And with that... I leave the rest in your capable hands... partner.Phoenix: Thanks...Phoenix: (...I still don't have answers for most of the riddles plaguing this case. The circumstances around the murder of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, no, I mean Ms. Misty Fey... The impossible flight Larry claims to have seen... And... What that woman is really after...) I will solve them all and bring this whole tragedy to an end!February 10, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Iris of Hazakura Temple.Godot: ...Phoenix: ... Umm... Your Honor...? Wh-What are you...?Judge: Who? Me? Well, my little brother came to visit me in my chambers earlier this morning. All of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, he developed a scorching fever and fainted! Therefore, I'll be standing in for him.Phoenix: I-I see, Your Honor... (So they're brothers! That explains a lot...)Judge: My poor brother. He looked a bit pale, not to mention sad that he couldn't be here.Godot: It is impossible to predict what the future has in store for any of us. This is precisely why people feel the need to judge the past. And we of the court have been charged with the solemn duty of passing such judgment.Judge: ...Well said, Mr. Godot. I understood exactly what you said... at least up until the end, anyway. Now then, Mr. Godot. Please proceed with your opening statement.Godot: ...Humans are fragile, fickle beings. Our hearts change with the shifting of the tides. There is only one thing that remains a constant in this crazy world... The bitter darkness that lies at the bottom of this mug.Judge: So then you mean...? Um... Forget it. What do you mean?Godot: During yesterday's trial, the accused refused to admit her role in the crime. But today, she has had a change of heart... Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple has a confession to make.Judge: C-Confession...! Th-The defendant...?Phoenix: (Iris... Why didn't she discuss this with me first...?)Judge: Very well. This court will now hear the defendant's confession!Godot: ...Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.Iris: ...Um, my name is Iris. I am but a simple nun undergoing training at Hazakura Temple.Judge: Witness, is there something that you want to confess to?Iris: ...Yes. But first, I want to apologize to Mr. Wright... I... I can't continue lying to everyone anymore.Phoenix: I-It's alright... What is it...?Iris: Mr. Wright, I have to admit that I... I did play a part in this terrible incident.Judge: Are... Are you actually confessing!? Are you saying that you were the one who murdered Ms. Elise Deauxnim?Iris: ...No, I'm not, Your Honor. But I dealt with the cover up, after the murder took place. After her spirit left, I took the lifeless shell of Mystic Elise... ...and carried it to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard where I desecrated it.Judge: Wh... Whaaaat!? O-Order in the court! Order! W-Witness...! Are you... Are you saying you were an accomplice to the murder!?Iris: ... Yes. That's correct.Phoenix: ...Whaaaaaaat!? (Three minutes in court and I'm already covered in a cold sweat...)Godot: Ha...! Everyone on the planet is an accomplice to something. It just happens to be that in this case, it's to murder. Isn't that right... Mr. Trite?Phoenix: (Grrr, that Godot... So this is the confession they were conferring about! It pains me to say this... ...but it looks like Iris's testimony was all a lie.)Iris's Testimony crumpled up and shoved into a pocket.Godot: Now then, little lady. If you don't mind, I've got a question for you. Whose crime were you trying to cover up by your actions?Phoenix: (Iris was covering for someone...? Nngh... Now I'm definitely up the creek without a paddle... or a lifejacket.)Iris: ...I've been at Hazakura Temple ever since I was a little girl. Hazakura Temple is run by one of the branch families of the Kurain Tradition. One of our missions is to protect the main family.Judge: I'm sorry, but \"main family\"...?Iris: Yes, and that's why I would dirty myself, if need be, to protect her... The daughter of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Maya Fey!Phoenix: Huh...?Godot: Wake up and smell the coffee, Trite.Phoenix: Sh-She's naming... MAYAAAAAAAAA!?Judge: Order! Order in the court! So not only did you witness the murder... You know the name of the murderer!Iris: I'm terribly sorry... But it's true. I saw her commit the crime with my very own eyes... And then I cleaned up the area to try to protect her.Phoenix:Phoenix: Th-That's ridiculous! Maya could never do such a--Judge: The defense will refrain from commenting until the appropriate time. Now, witness. Let's hear your testimony. What exactly happened on the night of the crime?Iris: ... ...Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix: (I thought I was prepared for the unexpected... But I never imagined the case would wind up going in this direction...)Witness Testimony-- The Real Murderer --Iris: I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden. I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff! While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike! Mystic Maya tried desperately to defend herself and stole the weapon...! It was only in self-defense! You can't blame her for it!Judge: So it was in self-defense?Iris: Yes. Mystic Elise was the one who attacked first!Judge: Hmm...Iris: That's why I tried my best to protect Mystic Maya!Godot: You moved the victim's body to the temple so that Maya wouldn't be suspected... Isn't that right? Not bad... You've got the instincts of a true criminal.Phoenix: (Something's not quite right. I'm sure it was established yesterday... ...that Iris never went to the Inner Temple that night. And that the person who did go was... that woman... ...Iris even admitted it.)Judge: Now then, Mr. Wright. Please proceed with your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Real Murderer --Iris: I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Sister Iris! Your testimony has changed quite a bit since yesterday. You stated yesterday that, on the night of the murder, you didn't go to the Inner Temple. Godot: Godot: Did she now? Too bad for you, what she said yesterday doesn't mean much today. By the way, where were you when she claimed that she didn't go? Phoenix: Umm, I... It was in the Inner Temple's Training Hall... Godot: A private conversation between the two of you does not constitute testimony. That would be properly described as hearsay. Judge: Hmm... What do you have to say, witness? Iris: I-I just couldn't tell him the truth at that time. Mystic Maya... She's your girlfriend, isn't she? Phoenix: ...! Iris: I... I didn't want to be the one to break it to you that I saw her commit murder... Judge: There, there... We all understand how difficult this is for you. Now then, let's continue with the testimony. What did you witness in the temple garden...? Iris: Well, Your Honor...Iris: I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're saying that the victim attacked Maya... I mean Ms. Fey? Iris: Y-Yes... It was a truly frightening scene. Mystic Maya was struck hard on the head and looked like she was going to collapse. Phoenix: What were you doing at the time? Iris: Um... Phoenix: Why didn't you stop them from fighting!? Iris: I-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wright... I was... I was frightened... I couldn't move... I couldn't even speak, I was in such shock... Judge: Hmm... That's perfectly understandable, my dear. Phoenix: (This doesn't sound right... I don't believe this testimony for a minute!) Judge: ...What happened after that?Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey. Iris: Ho-How can you be so sure...? Phoenix: Because the victim's real name was not \"Elise Deauxnim\". Her real name was... \"Misty Fey\". Judge: ...\"Fey\"? Iris: Aaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey! Judge: Wh-Who is this Misty Fey? Is she related to...? Phoenix: Misty Fey is the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She is also... ...the mother of Maya Fey! Judge: A-Are you serious!? Iris: Is it... really true? Mr. Wright...!? Was Elise Deauxnim actually the great Mystic Misty!? Phoenix: There's no doubt about it. (It looks like Iris had no idea...) Iris: I can hardly believe it... Phoenix: The idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing! Godot: ...Ugh...! Judge: Order in the court!! There's no doubt about it. This certainly is odd. I find it difficult to believe that a mother would try to kill her own daughter! Godot: Ha...! If it turns out that I'm wrong about this... I'll quit my day job and open up a coffee house. Judge: Hmm... Godot: I'd like to believe that domestic violence cases like these never occur, but... ...unfortunately, they're all too common. That's why people drink bitter coffee, you know. Judge: You've brought to light a very interesting fact, Mr. Wright... But I must agree with the prosecution that domestic violence is not all that rare. Phoenix: Y-You don't mean...!? Judge: The fact that they were mother and daughter doesn't itself disprove the witness's claims. I think it would be best if we returned to the testimony at hand. Iris: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Phoenix: (Somehow... It looks like I'm gonna have to find another contradiction in her testimony. Something more conclusive than this!)Iris: While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She moved in to deliver a fatal strike? Iris: ...Yes, I'm sure of it. She threw down her staff and reached into her robe for a weapon... Phoenix: Wait a minute! What was this weapon...? Iris: It-It was... some kind of dagger. Phoenix: (A dagger, huh...?) And Elise Deauxnim tried to stab her with this weapon? ...To kill Ms. Fey? Iris: Yes... Exactly. Phoenix: ... Godot: Ha...! You look like I did after I mistakenly took a swig of Worcestershire sauce. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Do you have a problem with the testimony we're hearing from your client, Lawyer Boy? Phoenix: (Hmm... Do I have a problem with Iris's testimony...?) No problem Phoenix: (Iris is my client... I'd better not press her too hard...) The defense has no objection to Ms. Iris's testimony. Godot: Ha...! You should try some nice, sweet caf√© con leche at least once, Trite... Judge: Very well, let's continue with your testimony. What happened to Ms. Fey when she was attacked by the victim? Leads back to cross-examination There is one thing... Phoenix: ...Your Honor. I have a small problem with the witness's testimony. Judge: Y-You do? But this witness is your own client! Phoenix: Yes, well... N-Nevertheless... Godot: ...That's fine. Witness, let's add your last statement to the testimony. Iris: Y-Yes, sir. Judge: H-Hey! Just a moment! It's my job to say that... Godot: ...Listen, gramps. I won't say it again. Final judgment will be rendered by me! Judge: Nnngghh...! Godot: ...OK, now. Let's continue. Adds statement \"She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!\"Press (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: She moved in to deliver a fatal strike?

Exactly.Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey. Iris: Ho-How can you be so sure...?

Something more conclusive than this!)Iris: She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She threw her staff away? Iris: Mystic Elise was trying to kill Mystic Maya. I think that's why she wanted a more lethal weapon. Judge: It's true... It's not easy to inflict a deadly blow with a staff. Phoenix: Sister Iris, let me make sure I've got this straight. The victim herself chose to throw away her staff? Iris: Y-Yes. That's what I saw... Judge: Is there anything odd about that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ... (Yeah, it's odd alright.) Iris: Mystic Elise attacked Mystic Maya with the dagger. I'm sure of this.Present Victim's Staff (if Elise Deauxnim profile was presented on any statement other than first) Phoenix: Phoenix: Sister Iris... There's something strange about your version of events. Iris: Huh...? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim throwing her staff away makes no sense at all to me. Iris: B-But all you can do with a staff is hit someone... Phoenix: Naturally you wouldn't know this, Sister Iris, but... ...the victim's staff had a special feature about it. As you can see, it's a sword. Iris: Ah...! Phoenix: If Elise Deauxnim really had wanted to kill Maya Fey... ...she wouldn't have needed to use a separate dagger! Not when she already had a beautiful blade in her hands already! Leads to: \"Order! Order in the court!\"Present Victim's Staff (if Elise Deauxnim profile was not presented on any statement other than first) Phoenix: Phoenix: Sister Iris... There's something strange about your version of events. Iris: Huh...? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim throwing her staff away makes no sense at all to me. Iris: B-But all you can do with a staff is hit someone... Phoenix: Naturally you wouldn't know this, Sister Iris, but... ...the victim's staff had a special feature about it. As you can see, it's a sword. Iris: Ah...! Phoenix: If Elise Deauxnim really had wanted to kill Maya Fey... ...she wouldn't have needed to use a separate dagger! Not when she already had a beautiful blade in her hands already! ...Well, Sister Iris? What do you have to say? Iris: Uhh, err, I... Godot: Godot: ...That was an impressive bit of investigating, Trite. I never would have thought there was a sword hidden in that staff. But even so... How should I put this? Phoenix: ...! Godot: A long sword is unwieldy, and thus quite ineffective in close-quarters combat. Maybe that's why she chose a dagger over her blade. Phoenix: Um, well... Godot: Anyway, the type of weapon she chose to use isn't what's important. The important thing is that she tried to kill Maya Fey. As long as there's nothing strange about that, there's no problem with her testimony. Phoenix: (But there is something strange about this whole testimony!) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? The prosecution has a point. Phoenix: ...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument. Iris: M-Mr. Wright...! Phoenix: I have here another piece of evidence that shows that this testimony can't be trusted. Because Ms. Elise Deauxnim would never attempt to take the life of Maya Fey! Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Godot? Godot: If you ask me... ...the only thing that seems strange is the angle of Mr. Trite's index finger. Phoenix: Eh... Godot: Trite, sticking your finger in an electrical outlet might be safer for you. Otherwise it might get bitten off the next time you poke it in the wrong place! Phoenix: Arrrrgh...! (I still don't think that Ms. Deauxnim would ever attack Maya... If you think about their relationship, it's obvious!) Judge: ...Why don't you think it over one more time. Leads back to: \"...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument.\" Phoenix: ...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey. Iris: Ho-How can you be so sure...? Phoenix: Because the victim's real name was not \"Elise Deauxnim\". Her real name was... \"Misty Fey\". Judge: ...\"Fey\"? Iris: Aaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey! Judge: Wh-Who is this Misty Fey? Is she related to...? Phoenix: Misty Fey is the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She is also... ...the mother of Maya Fey! Judge: A-Are you serious!? Iris: Is it... really true? Mr. Wright...!? Was Elise Deauxnim actually the great Mystic Misty!? Phoenix: There's no doubt about it. (It looks like Iris had no idea...) Iris: I can hardly believe it... Phoenix: The idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing! Godot: ...Ugh...! Leads to: \"Order! Order in the court!\"Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey. Iris: Ho-How can you be so sure...? Phoenix: Because the victim's real name was not \"Elise Deauxnim\". Her real name was... \"Misty Fey\". Judge: ...\"Fey\"? Iris: Aaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey!

Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing! Godot: ...Ugh...! Judge: Order in the court!! There's no doubt about it. This certainly is odd. I find it difficult to believe that a mother would try to kill her own daughter! Godot: Ha...! If it turns out that I'm wrong about this... I'll quit my day job and open up a coffee house. Judge: Hmm... Godot: I'd like to believe that domestic violence cases like these never occur, but... ...unfortunately, they're all too common. That's why people drink bitter coffee, you know. Judge: You've brought to light a very interesting fact, Mr. Wright... But I must agree with the prosecution that domestic violence is not all that rare. Phoenix: Y-You don't mean...!? Judge: The fact that they were mother and daughter doesn't itself disprove the witness's claims. I think it would be best if we returned to the testimony at hand. Iris: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Phoenix: (Somehow... It looks like I'm gonna have to find another contradiction in her testimony. Something more conclusive than this!)Iris: Mystic Maya tried desperately to defend herself and stole the weapon...!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...And then? Iris: Mystic Maya, she turned things around and then... ...she used the weapon she had taken and lunged forward for a strike! Judge: W-Witness! Are you absolutely certain!? Iris: Yes... B-But believe me, she had no choice! If Mystic Maya hadn't done something... Godot: ...Maya Fey's name would've been written on this autopsy report instead. Judge: Hmm... Yes, I see... Phoenix: (This is bad... I still can't put the pieces together... Unless I find a contradiction  in her testimony, Maya's going to get blamed for this.) Iris: I... I only have this to say...Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey. Iris: Ho-How can you be so sure...? Phoenix: Because the victim's real name was not \"Elise Deauxnim\". Her real name was... \"Misty Fey\". Judge: ...\"Fey\"? Iris: Aaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey!

You can't blame her for it!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...So you're saying Maya Fey was the one who stabbed Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Sister Iris! Is that really what you saw? Iris: Yes... Godot: Godot: Tsk, tsk, tsk, Trite. If your mug is filled with black and bitter suspicions... The only way to get rid of them is to drink them down quick... ...Like this! Phoenix: Umm... I know that's supposed be a metaphor, but I don't get it. Godot: There's only one thing you need to \"get\", Trite. It's called evidence... Now hurry up... Before my next cup gets cold! Phoenix: (What does that mean...? Is Godot waiting for me to point out the contradictions?) Iris: ...Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey. Iris: Ho-How can you be so sure...?

Something more conclusive than this!)Phoenix: (I'd like to avoid the whole spirit channeling thing if I can... Not only would it be inadmissible as evidence... ...but I think it might actually hurt our standing with the judge. First I need to pick her testimony apart and expose the unnatural-sounding parts... I don't know why Iris would tell a story like this... ...but there are two things I noticed that just don't add up!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Hey, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah? What is it? Maya: You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you? Phoenix: Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all. Maya: But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right? Phoenix: Um... I guess so, yeah. Maya: Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up! Phoenix: (Pearls...?) Pearl: So! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick! Phoenix: ...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face? Pearl: It's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special! Phoenix: ...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.) Maya: \"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true! Phoenix: I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me. Maya: It's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training! Phoenix: (Now I definitely don't want to go...) Maya: You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there! Phoenix: Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious? Pearl: Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us! Maya: Yeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"! Phoenix: Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway. Maya: Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff! Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"? Pearl: No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall! Phoenix: ... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places. Maya: Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!? Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!? Phoenix: Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!? Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun... Maya: Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick? Phoenix: (Th-This girl... I-It's...!) Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence. Dahlia: Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me! Phoenix: But... It can't be!

Pearl: Wow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple! Maya: P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo! ???: Well, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple! Maya: Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo! ???: Oh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold. Phoenix: What's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--! ???: Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside. Maya: Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass-- ???: Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. Bikini: I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini. Maya: B-B-B-Bikini...!? Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! Maya: It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Pearl: R-Reckless...?

Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir√©e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! ‚ô™Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!‚ô™ Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask‚òÜDeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:¬†??? Time:¬†???Location:¬†??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record.

Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim.

Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge.

(Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning. (Changed from [I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Edgeworth: (Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!) Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Oh my... Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...? Edgeworth: Apparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all. Iris: ... ...... Edgeworth: This is no time to be embarrassed! Iris: I-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing. Edgeworth: Worry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him! Iris: Does that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...? Edgeworth: ...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand. Iris: Sister Bikini... Edgeworth: She claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct? Iris: ... That is correct. It wasn't me. Edgeworth: ...Very well, then. Iris: Um... Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: You are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed... Edgeworth: Don't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements. (Changed from [Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.] in the original release) Iris: I-I see... (Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people. Iris: ... Edgeworth: But right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what my friend told me once. (Changed from [That's what a friend of mine told me once.] in the original release) Iris: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I simply ask that you watch and decide for yourself... (Changed from [You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide...] in the original release) ...whether or not I am fit to do the task I have been entrusted. (Changed from [...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.] in the original release) Iris: ... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands. February 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Judge: ...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Judge: I'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant... ???: ???: The prosecution... stands ready. Judge: A-And you are...? von Karma: Franziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy. Judge: V-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma? von Karma: ... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case. Judge: Y-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: I'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once... Edgeworth: ...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor. Judge: Ms. von Karma? Do you have anything to say? von Karma: ... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office. Judge: There... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack! von Karma: ...I told you, there is no such weakling! Judge: Wh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...I have no objection to the whip. Judge: Y-You don't...? Edgeworth: The prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today! von Karma: This promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers! Edgeworth: ...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic. Judge: Allow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah! von Karma: ...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible! von Karma: The murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue. Judge: The sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: There is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime. Judge: ...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand! Edgeworth: (And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!) von Karma: ...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please. Judge: H-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight! Edgeworth: If I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release) Judge: Bailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please! von Karma: ...Once again. Your name and occupation, please. Bikini: Little old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone. Judge: ... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah! von Karma: ...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once! Judge: Y-You want me to leave!? Bikini: No need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Edgeworth: In any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question. Bikini: That's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that... Judge: Let us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh! Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Judge: Hmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple? Bikini: ...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...) von Karma: There is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple...? Bikini: Well, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right? Judge: We'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam. Bikini: ...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training. Edgeworth: And how exactly do you help with this process...? Bikini: It is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising. von Karma: Like a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies. Edgeworth: (A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place? Bikini: Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Violently...? Bikini: That's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...? Bikini: That's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off! Bikini: So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You \"left Iris to help\"... With what? Bikini: What do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper. Judge: Wasn't it your place to remain with the disciple? Bikini: Well, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away. Edgeworth: Just to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct? Bikini: Yes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions. Present Iris's Testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all. Bikini: Well, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: In that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all! Bikini: N... No...! She said that...? von Karma: von Karma: A defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi. von Karma: ...! Bikini: But that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...! Judge: Hmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah! von Karma: ...All people lie. That is my belief. Judge: Why am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question... Bikini: Dear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you? Judge: A-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I... Bikini: My memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter! Judge: Then... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence. Edgeworth: ...Understood, Your Honor. (I was na√Øve to think that alone would do the trick.) Judge: Then please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination. Changes statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\" Bikini: Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure that you're not making a mistake...? Bikini: ...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor! Edgeworth: Nngh...! Bikini: Iris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake! Judge: ...An excellent finish there, witness. Edgeworth: (Still, I have to wonder...) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\" Bikini: There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath? Bikini: My back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all. Edgeworth: How long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking? Bikini: ... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind! Edgeworth: ...? Bikini: I bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones... Edgeworth: W-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah! von Karma: ...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth. Judge: The lowest of the low. Edgeworth: (Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?) Bikini: Anyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so... Bikini: It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The crime took place in the courtyard, correct...? Bikini: When you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard. von Karma: That's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case! Judge: Hmm... That certainly seems to be true. Edgeworth: (There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.) Edgeworth: ...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct? Bikini: Of course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute... von Karma: von Karma: H-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!? Edgeworth: That's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung. von Karma: W... What!? Edgeworth: ...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release) Bikini: Well well well! Edgeworth: (It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...) Judge: Order! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa! von Karma: ...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you? Bikini: Spares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them. Judge: I see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh? Bikini: Each nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned... Judge: Hmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah! von Karma: If there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here! Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: (I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.) Judge: ...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision. Bikini: I-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this... von Karma: Sister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple! Edgeworth: (Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.) Witness Testimony -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Judge: You saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that. Edgeworth: (This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...) von Karma: I would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours? Cross Examination -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple? Bikini: Let me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge. von Karma: Still, you never made it back there that night, did you? Bikini: T-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall... Bikini: And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you heard a noise...? Bikini: \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: ...That could only be the sound of the victim falling. Bikini: It's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that. Judge: But then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground? Bikini: ... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha... Judge: Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah! von Karma: The next one to laugh gets a whipping! Bikini: Well. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and... Bikini: Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims. Bikini: Hey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to... Edgeworth: The murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can! Bikini: Hmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time! Edgeworth: ...Please, don't keep us in suspense. Bikini: Her hood! von Karma: Her hood...? Bikini: That's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right? Edgeworth: ...Urk! von Karma: Hah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: What do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important? It's not important Edgeworth: (...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them. Judge: Hmm... Judge: Very well. ...Please, continue with your testimony. von Karma: Hmph... Leads back to cross-examination It's important Edgeworth: (This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony. von Karma: Heh... Miles Edgeworth. von Karma: If you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip! Judge: Witness. Add that statement to your testimony. Bikini: ...No problem. Adds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" Bikini: Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You are sure about that...? Bikini: Yes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it! Edgeworth: ...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself. Bikini: Anyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out. von Karma: Like me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip. Edgeworth: (At least then it might bite you and not someone else...) Bikini: Iris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it! Judge: ...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh. Bikini: Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct? Judge: Which means... the victim's room was on the second floor? Bikini: No, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building. Judge: I see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct? Bikini: Yes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all... Bikini: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What makes you so sure of all this...? Bikini: It's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: You're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height. Judge: Hmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then. Bikini: Yep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (There's only two of them working there...!) von Karma: What's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark? Edgeworth: ... Present Elise's Autopsy Report Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\" Edgeworth: (...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.) Edgeworth: ...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway. Bikini: Oh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter! Edgeworth: However... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report? von Karma: T-The autopsy report...? Edgeworth: The victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed. von Karma: Ah...! Judge: T-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here! Edgeworth: The scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!? von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree? von Karma: Th-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Were there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: She was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree? Judge: W-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room. Judge: ...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah! von Karma: I'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood. Judge: When it produces the most blood...? von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: Indeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound. Judge: That's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking! von Karma: We have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions! Judge: Order! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events! Edgeworth: (I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!) von Karma: ...Hmph... Judge: It seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate! Bikini: Don't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood! von Karma: Sister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here. Edgeworth: (...With the whip?) Bikini: ...Oh, boy. Alright, alright... Witness Testimony -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. I've never seen so much blood before... That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Judge: Hmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory... von Karma: Von Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...) Cross Examination -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time... was the victim bleeding? Bikini: Well... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then. von Karma: ...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound. Edgeworth: In any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!? Bikini: Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Think carefully. This is very important. Bikini: It's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.) von Karma: The victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out? Bikini: That's right... Bikini: The whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah... Judge: It goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding. von Karma: ...Nothing out of place here. Edgeworth: (Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.) Present Shichishito Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\" Bikini: I've never seen so much blood before... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood? Bikini: T-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too... von Karma: When the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner. Edgeworth: Wh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?) Judge: Hmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me... Edgeworth: (What should I do...? Press this point further?) Stop here Edgeworth: (I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding! Leads back to cross-examination Press further Edgeworth: Going back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...? Bikini: Well, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw. Judge: W-What did you see? Bikini: Maybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day. Edgeworth: Pulling the sword out...? Bikini: Well, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\". Judge: Witness! You will add this statement to your testimony! Bikini: Oh... Was that important...!? Edgeworth: (More important than you can imagine...) Adds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...? Bikini: No mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day! Edgeworth: ...Don't you think that's a bit odd? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Why would the killer pull out the sword? von Karma: What...? Edgeworth: If all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Indeed... It is strange, now that you mention it. Edgeworth: (I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...) von Karma: A-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness? Bikini: That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Now, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct? Bikini: Well... I was unconscious... von Karma: How long were you out for? Bikini: I don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually. Judge: Hmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation! Bikini: Well, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you. Edgeworth: ...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...? Bikini: And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct? Bikini: Just stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough. Bikini: But to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...! von Karma: Truly, a heinous, despicable crime. Edgeworth: It is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily... von Karma: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem? Edgeworth: Exactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that? von Karma: ...! Judge: Hmmmmm... No, I don't think I can. von Karma: ... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts! Bikini: That's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself... Edgeworth: (\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.) Edgeworth: (There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.) Edgeworth: Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here. Bikini: W-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. von Karma: What contradictions are you talking about? Edgeworth: In the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities! Judge: What do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah! von Karma: Explain yourself! Edgeworth: To start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that. von Karma: von Karma: \"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose! Judge: The objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly. von Karma: T-That's... Edgeworth: We also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: T-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction. Judge: Y-You've still got more!? Edgeworth: ...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it? von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: If this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword! von Karma: Noooooo! Judge: Order! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa! von Karma: Bravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that! Judge: But what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but... Edgeworth: ...Having come this far, there can only be one answer. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito! Judge: W-Whaaaaaaaaat!? von Karma: A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool. Edgeworth: Let's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon? Bikini: W-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it... Edgeworth: ...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah! von Karma: So maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object. Judge: Hmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises. Judge: The obvious... question? Edgeworth: ...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: It goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found. von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Answer the question, Ms. von Karma! von Karma: ... No evidence of that kind was found. Judge: Hmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast! Bikini: Excuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually... von Karma: ...What is it, Sister? Bikini: I was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there... Judge: ... What exactly are you going on aboot here? Bikini: The murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of! Edgeworth: You what!? von Karma: Well then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister. Edgeworth: (Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?) Witness Testimony -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Judge: Hmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time. Bikini: Well. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know. von Karma: Quite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph. Judge: A snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory... von Karma: The tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge! Tracks Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: ...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon! Edgeworth: (Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...You are sure about the time? Bikini: Yes... I was worried about it, after all. Judge: Why was that? Bikini: Because I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.) von Karma: Please continue, Sister. Bikini: And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct? Bikini: Right, right, the one who trampled me. Edgeworth: (It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...) Bikini: There isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him? Edgeworth: He had forgotten it at home, apparently. von Karma: What a na√Øve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too! Bikini: Anyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell. Bikini: And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited. Bikini: That's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls! Edgeworth: Now, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived? Bikini: Yes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate. von Karma: So... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time. Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?) Press further Edgeworth: (...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time? Bikini: Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean? Judge: What do you mean, eh? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used. Bikini: Ah! I see! I never thought of that! Judge: Hmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too! von Karma: ...Of course you did. Edgeworth: Then answer the question please, witness. Bikini: ... I don't often go around touching hot engines... Edgeworth: ...Hmm. Bikini: However... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it. Judge: Snow...? Bikini: Yes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow... Edgeworth: (There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!) Judge: It seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh! von Karma: How long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Stop here Edgeworth: (It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Judge: How long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Bikini: It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking. Bikini: Ah! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain? Judge: I think that's why the question was asked in the first place... Bikini: ...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch. Judge: Hmm... Crunch. Bikini: ...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then... Bikini: Anyway, the killer must have used it! Bikini: Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Refresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...? Bikini: Like I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes. von Karma: It's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile... Edgeworth: ...I have to concede that is more than enough time. von Karma: Is that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Bikini: ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: While it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here. Judge: Oh? And what would this mystery element be? Edgeworth: The killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods? Judge: Hmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah! von Karma: Turning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor. Judge: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (She's as over the top as always...) von Karma: A-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Edgeworth: (Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...) Edgeworth: I admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder. von Karma: You've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: However... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks? von Karma: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Iris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back. Bikini: ... Ah...! You're right! von Karma: Hmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...? von Karma: On the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it! Judge: I see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow. von Karma: What do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?) It's flawless. Edgeworth: ...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow. Edgeworth: I do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim. von Karma: ...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night? Bikini: Well... that would be...! von Karma: ...You can't hide it. I already know the answer. Bikini: ......... It could only be Iris. Judge: A-And the reason being...!? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. von Karma: A key... that the defendant is responsible for! Edgeworth: Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment. Judge: What is it, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: There is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim! Judge: ... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!? Edgeworth: Nngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!) Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" There is a contradiction. Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" Edgeworth: The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible. von Karma: ... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction? Edgeworth: ...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me. Judge: On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow! Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Witness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime. Bikini: Like I said! It was around 11. Edgeworth: ...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder. Judge: The... weather report...? Edgeworth: Snow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Therefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up! von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! Judge: Very well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things! Edgeworth: ... von Karma: Answer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!? Judge: Ah, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah! von Karma: Forecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM! Judge: Hmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh! Edgeworth: W-What!? (How did she pull that off!?) Judge: \"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this. Edgeworth: (I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony. von Karma: Hah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!? Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ... Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: It looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth... Edgeworth: ...! Judge: And to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry. Edgeworth: (This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.) von Karma: Respond! Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Even if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple! Leads back to: \"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\" Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Here is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...? Judge: ... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case. Edgeworth: ... Nothing else...? Judge: Nothing else. von Karma: Oh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Nngh...! Edgeworth: (According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!) Leads back to: \"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\" Edgeworth: Ultimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed... von Karma: That's right. But proving that is... Edgeworth: Incredibly easy. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: If we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why! von Karma: Gnnngh! Edgeworth: In other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks! von Karma: Aaaaah! Judge: Order! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah! von Karma: J-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing. von Karma: Of course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release) Edgeworth: Then when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained. Judge: Hmmmmm... Bikini: Can I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me... von Karma: ...What does, Sister? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. Edgeworth: ...! von Karma: Furthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder! Bikini: ...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple... Edgeworth: (But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...) Bikini: The snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot. Judge: ...That sounds right. Bikini: But... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge. von Karma: Y-You must have just failed to see it, Sister. Bikini: Maybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too... Edgeworth: B-But that... isn't possible! Judge: Order! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean? von Karma: ...Nngh... Edgeworth: So then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple! Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...) Judge: ... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release) Bikini: Yes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know. Judge: But then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile! Edgeworth: (A witness, huh...) Judge: Was there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night? Bikini: ... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do. Judge: Hmmmm... That's a shame. Edgeworth: (Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release) Judge: R-Really!? von Karma: ...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...? Edgeworth: I don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind. Judge: Which are...? Edgeworth: First... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder. von Karma: ...And the second being? Edgeworth: This individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!? Present Larry Butz profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: Just what is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth...? Are you saying that... this is the person who was near Dusky Bridge that night? Edgeworth: I-I did think so, however... Aaah! von Karma: You're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Cool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!) Judge: Hmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual... Did they really see the snowmobile that night? Leads back to: \"I don't know for sure if he saw it or not...\" Judge: This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"... Edgeworth: This is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim. Judge: Her student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder? Edgeworth: T-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason. von Karma: And so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw? Edgeworth: I intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom. Judge: Summon this youth as a witness immediately! von Karma: ... I have no choice, do I? Edgeworth: I believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him. Judge: ...Very well. Edgeworth: (Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!) Judge: ...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness. von Karma: ...Understood, Your Honor. Judge: Good... Well then! Court is now in recess! To be continued. February 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Excuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say... Edgeworth: Iris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene. Iris: ...Alright. I'll help you any way I can. Edgeworth: First, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: ...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile? Iris: ... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me. Edgeworth: So it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge? Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: Iris... Iris: I can't... tell you about that... yet. Edgeworth: \"Yet\"...? Iris: Not until her safety is confirmed... Edgeworth: Her? Iris: The safety of the acolyte... Edgeworth: (The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life. Edgeworth: ... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough. February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: ...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...? von Karma: During the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery. Edgeworth: Suspicious behavior...? von Karma: He was sketching something... Very intensely. Judge: Dare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained? von Karma: He drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip. Judge: ... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah! von Karma: Anyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here! Edgeworth: (It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...) Butz: Ouch! von Karma: ...Your sketch is in contempt of this court! Butz: H-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch! von Karma: You tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct? Butz: L-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\". Edgeworth: ...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...? Butz: I know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it? Judge: Working in the fields...? Edgeworth: I presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope. Butz: Th-That's it! Thanks, buddy! Edgeworth: (It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...) Butz: I just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model! von Karma: ... Butz: So see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Judge: Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Stop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man! Judge: Refrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now! Butz: Waaaah... This is almost too much for me...! Witness Testimony -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... I didn't see a s-snowmobile! I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) The girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me... I'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!? Judge: Witness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony! Butz: I-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!? Judge: ... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex. Edgeworth: ...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people! Butz: Yeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy! Judge: ...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time. Cross Examination -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Judge: What ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: This one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: So, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way. Butz: OK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a \"lodge\", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right? Edgeworth: ... von Karma: See? You can do it if you try. Butz: Heh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: ...There is only one issue here. What you saw at Dusky Bridge. Butz: I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"A number of times\"...? How many? Butz: Maybe... five times? I went once every twenty minutes. Edgeworth: Which means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night? Butz: You bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands! Judge: Love, you say...? Edgeworth: It was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter. Judge: B-Blackmail...!? Butz: No, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh! von Karma: You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness! Judge: So... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh! Butz: Um... well... You see... Edgeworth: (Being called those names doesn't seem to bother him at all...) Butz: I didn't see a s-snowmobile! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Larry! You really didn't see it? Butz: H-H-Hey! No need to hit your desk! I can hear you! ...I didn't see it! I didn't see a s-s-snowmobile! Edgeworth: ... Larry. Say \"snowmobile\" for me, please? Butz: S-S-S-Snowmobile. Edgeworth: If you truly have nothing to hide... ...then why are you stammering like you just flew over a cuckoo's nest!? Butz: Sh-Shut up! W-W-What is this!? I don't know! Don't ask me! Edgeworth: (It seems that I'll need to start from a more obvious contradiction. I'm going to strike the blow that will finally get him to spill the beans!) Butz: I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You didn't meet anyone? Butz: That's right. Because I've got nothing to do with this! And I'm just here to buy some viridian paint, OK!? Come on, I expect to see those crimson lake faces! Now! Judge: ... It would appear that simply pressing him isn't going to be enough, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry Butz...\" Edgeworth: (It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...) Edgeworth: Larry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble... Butz: I'm sorry...! Edgeworth: But... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction. Butz: Edgey! Are you... trying to console me? Judge: It certainly doesn't sound that way to me. Edgeworth: However... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create! Butz: Waaah... You're totally pinning this on me... Edgeworth: ...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz! Butz: ... That's right. Me, in the flesh. Judge: Hmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change! Butz: B-But...! What do you want me to do, then!? Edgeworth: Larry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well... Judge: I'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder? Witness Testimony -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. That's when I ran into Nick. Judge: Hmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you? von Karma: So... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire? Butz: It was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall. von Karma: W-What did you say!? Edgeworth: Oh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release) von Karma: ...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release) Judge: Now, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half? Butz: Well, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess. Judge: Hmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...? Butz: I set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too. Edgeworth: ...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end. von Karma: Because they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they? Butz: Shut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her. Butz: I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This \"light\" was, of course... Butz: Lightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah! von Karma: ...Or a little like that? Butz: Waaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda! Judge: Witness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge? Butz: Well, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so... Butz: I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Seeing that, what did you do? Butz: What do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart! von Karma: And that's why you went to take a look at the bridge? Butz: Well. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind. Judge: Hmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness. Butz: There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that? Butz: Hmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\" von Karma: How far is this small shack you were in from the bridge? Butz: Hold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk? Edgeworth: And how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there? Butz: Like I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare! Edgeworth: (...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?) Not right now. Edgeworth: (I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Why didn't you call anyone? Edgeworth: ...Larry. Let me ask you one thing. Butz: What is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face? Edgeworth: Why didn't you call anyone? Butz: Huh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Normally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct? Butz: ... Well, of course I thought of doing that. Judge: So then... let's hear why you didn't! Butz: H-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" Why did you go to the bridge? Edgeworth: So you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so? Butz: W-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there. Edgeworth: If that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning. Judge: In which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness! Butz: M-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" Butz: That's when I ran into Nick. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did Phoenix Wright look when you met him? Butz: Hmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment. von Karma: How far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge? Butz: On his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say. Judge: ...And that's when the murder was reported? Butz: That's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge! Butz: I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright? Butz: Y-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway. Edgeworth: (What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!) von Karma: It was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct? Butz: Yeah. That's pretty much it. More or less. Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\" Butz: I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you decided to go and see what was happening? Butz: That's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special? Edgeworth: (Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce \"spectacle\"?) Judge: Life seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt... Butz: Well, my motto is to \"hit life back as hard as I can.\" A-Agah! von Karma: ...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip. Edgeworth: (...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.) Edgeworth: Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not... Butz: What the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien! Edgeworth: But your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time. Butz: I've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those. Edgeworth: ...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct? Butz: Yeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less. Edgeworth: ...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM. Butz: ...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act. Edgeworth: That is impossible. von Karma: ...What do you mean? Edgeworth: 11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time! von Karma: ...! Butz: Ah! Excuse me! I-I have an objection! Judge: You do? Butz: Edgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah! von Karma: ...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that! Edgeworth: ...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM! von Karma: And why not!? Edgeworth: It is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM! Judge: Which means... what, exactly? Edgeworth: Wright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!? Butz: Urk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh! von Karma: ...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem! Butz: Yeah! Not much of a problem at all! Edgeworth: Really...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident? Judge: Yes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release) Edgeworth: And therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release) von Karma: Th-That's what it sounds like... Edgeworth: Ah, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude. Edgeworth: ...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time. Butz: Listen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!? Edgeworth: Y-Yes... Butz: I may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah! von Karma: ...Then say it! Judge: Very well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!? Witness Testimony -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Judge: Hmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk... Butz: That's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch! Edgeworth: (...Including the truth, from the sound of it!) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts? Edgeworth: Not at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains. Judge: And what would that be? Edgeworth: This is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him! Butz: Hah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey! Cross Examination -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tell us, Larry... Butz: My name is Laurice! Get it right! Mistakes like that are what keep you from being popular with the ladies like I am! Judge: ... Just who exactly are you!? Butz: I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Apprentice extraordinaire! Edgeworth: That's what he calls himself, in any case. Judge: ...Then you are... an artist? Butz: Of course! I'm an artist, the real thing! Edgeworth: Yet again, that's what he calls himself. von Karma: ...Names mean nothing. There is only one issue I care to discuss. What were you doing? Edgeworth: (That is a very big issue, indeed.) Butz: Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: S-Sketching!? The burning bridge? Butz: The burning bridge and everything that came with it! Edgeworth: ... What? \"Came with it\"...? Butz: You want to hear this from my lips, do you, Edgey!? Y-You'll regret this! That sketch of mine is... Gaaah! von Karma: ...Enough. Just take that ridiculous sketch of yours out already, witness! Butz: ... W-W-W-What are you talking about? I don't know what you mean! Judge: That does indeed appear to be the fastest solution. ...I'll leave it to you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (What should I do...? I've got a terrible feeling that the instant this sketch is revealed... ...the entire world may be changed by what is depicted there...!) Leave it alone Edgeworth: ...I cannot recommend looking at the sketch. His \"works of art\" are a force of nature best measured on the Richter scale. Butz: That's right! They'll shake your heart to pieces! Judge: Hmmmm... This courtroom has yet to meet earthquake standards! I think we'd better pass! ...In which case, let us turn to other leads. Leads back to cross-examination Look at the sketch Edgeworth: ...Larry. I wonder if you could show us your sketch. Please? Butz: ... Well, well... Even I couldn't have imagined it'd turn out like this. Edgeworth: ...Imagined what? Butz: That Laurice Deauxnim's debut would take place here, today, like this! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Show it! Now! Butz: OK... But steel yourselves! This... is the world of Laurice Deauxnim! Judge: ... Ah. Um... Well... So this... this is Dusky Bridge, correct? Q-Quite a large bridge, isn't it? Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Y-Yes, well... I-It's a better drawing than I expected. Butz: Isn't it? Isn't it? I struggled to reproduce those flames. I really did! Judge: ...Yes, I'm sure you did. ... von Karma: ...... Butz: ...... Edgeworth: (Nngh... This is going to get ugly... No one has the bravery to bring it up, it seems... This... mysterious flying object...) ...Larry. Butz: What? Edgeworth: The burning bridge is fine. But... What is that unfortunate looking figure...? Butz: Ah. You spotted that? I thought you might. Edgeworth: However much I might want to ignore it... I can't. Butz: It's Iris, of course! Iris! I wish she'd take better care of herself. We have to plan for our future, you know! What would've happened to her if she had injured herself flying like that...? Edgeworth: ... Larry, please. Answer this next question honestly. Butz: OK. Edgeworth: Are you REALLY claiming to have seen this? Are you claiming to have seen the silhouette of the defendant... ...flying over a bridge that was engulfed in flames...? Butz: Yep. That's what I saw. That's why I drew it! I'm an artist! A real artist! Edgeworth: Are...! von Karma: You...! Judge: High! The girl... She's really high up in this picture! Judge: Uwaaah! What was that for!? von Karma: ...This is all a bad dream. I was hitting you on the cheek to test that theory! Judge: Please whip your own cheek from now on if you wish to test your wild theories! A-Anyway! No court of law will ever acknowledge... ...that p-p-people can f-f-fly! von Karma: ...Actually, there is some precedent for this. Butz: She was flying pretty high, my sweet Iris. She was about 30 feet above the bridge, at least! It was really something to see! Judge: Th-This has to be some kind of m-m-mistake! ...Mr. Edgeworth, please bring the witness back down to earth! Edgeworth: What? Me...!? Judge: This witness is your friend, is he not? von Karma: \"Accessory to foolishness...\" ...Miles Edgeworth. Judge: Let us get back to the cross-examination! By force, if necessary! Mr. Edgeworth, I expect you to expose the obvious contradiction here! Edgeworth: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (Looks like I've got another reason to remember this moron...) Butz: ...Well, what did you think of my debut piece? Judge: Get that thing away from me! Larry's Sketch added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, hurry up and cross-examine him! Adds statement \"I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Could the reason you were so excited be...? Butz: What do you think!? My girlfriend was flying through the sky! Almost 30 feet above the bridge! I felt like I might start flying myself. Edgeworth: (If only you'd be so kind as to fly out of all of our lives...!) Butz: Anyway! I completely lost myself when I was drawing this scene! Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just where did you see this sight from!? Butz: Hey! No need to shout... When I was lying in bed in that run-down shack... The crack of the lightning bolt made me realize that the bridge was burning. I just watched it for a while from there, thinking how nicely it was burning! Then after about five minutes, I saw it. von Karma: The defendant \"flying\"...? Butz: That's right! That's when I decided to go to the bridge! Judge: ...I see. That all makes sense. Aside from the sketch itself... Edgeworth: (Yes... This sketch doesn't make any sense... I just need to convince the artist that his work is ludicrous.) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry. What did you really see that night...?\" Butz: The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The burning bridge moved you that much, did it? ...I find that hard to believe. Butz: You moron, Edgey! You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook! von Karma: An artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad! Butz: W-W-What has that got to do with anything!? Judge: I'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness. Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You transfered everything \"directly onto the page\"...? And that is this sketch here? Butz: Yep! Sensational, isn't it? Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway. von Karma: It did? Butz: That's right! The reason she didn't come to me, even though I waited for her... ...Was because she was trapped on the other side of the bridge! Judge: ... Butz: Could it be that Iris... ...undertook that dangerous, despereate flight in order to reach me...!? That's gotta be it! Alright! Go, me! Nice ooooooouch! von Karma: ...Continue. Please. Butz: ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot the passage of time to that extent, did you? Butz: Well... Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else... Edgeworth: (That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.) von Karma: Phoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts. Judge: Aside from doubts of his humanity, eh... Edgeworth: (There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!) Edgeworth: Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care. Butz: In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth! Edgeworth: If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain. Judge: What might that be...? Edgeworth: That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris! Butz: W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh! von Karma: A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim? Edgeworth: ...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct? Butz: Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah! von Karma: It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench. Edgeworth: ...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!? Butz: W-What are you talking about!? Edgeworth: ...I think you understand what I mean just fine. Butz: Why...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!? Edgeworth: What...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Butz: Edgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog! Judge: I do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage. Butz: ...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah! von Karma: ...What is it now, witness? Butz: It feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you! Edgeworth: W-What...!? Judge: What is the meaning of your outburst, witness!? Butz: ...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence. Edgeworth: \"Definitive\"...? von Karma: \"Evidence\"...? Butz: Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it! Judge: I didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality! Butz: ...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain! Edgeworth: (...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.) Witness Testimony -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Judge: A c-crystal sphere...!? Butz: This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers! von Karma: That sphere... Where did you find it? Butz: Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right. Edgeworth: And it was half-buried in the snow...? Butz: It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one! Butz: I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na√Øve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris! Iris: ... Phoenix: (Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?) To be continued. February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Edgeworth: Wright, is this what Godot was talking about? Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask‚òÜDeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: ‚ô™No motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!‚ô™ ‚ô™...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...‚ô™ Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! ‚ô™Good cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...‚ô™ Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting¬†??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain.

It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you.

Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.)

That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder!

I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright...

Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once.

Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?)

Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure.

Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Usually, a picture is enough to channel someone's spirit, but this time... Butz: ...Pretty weird, huh? Phoenix: (Like Larry knows anything about this stuff!)

How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this!

Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah!

Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why.

Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea...

Godot: It was your job to protect her, Trite. Just like it was your job to protect Mia Fey... Two sisters, caught up in the worst circumstances. Phoenix: I... I realize that, but... Godot: And you were the only one who was by their sides. You were the only one who could have saved them. Phoenix: But I didn't know anything about what was going on! Godot: Ha...! What did I just say, Trite? Being oblivious is a heinous crime in itself. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Tomorrow... We'll settle everything in court tomorrow. ...Once and for all. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick... Is... Is what that man just said true? Phoenix: It'll be alright, Pearls. I'm sure Maya's alive. You'll see for yourself tomorrow! Pearl: I... Yeah! That's right! I know I can trust you, Mr. Nick! Morgan: ...My dear Pearl... ...You've done so well, my child. My Pearl... ...It's better that you don't know what you've done... (Changed from [...It's better that you don't know...] in the original release) ...I knew this day would come for you... ...The blood of the main family is no more... ...Now, finally... After all this time... the Master's seat is yours... (Changed from [...Now you... You are to take the place at the head of the Fey clan...] in the original release) ...My last, great wish... It seems I was just in time... To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Nothing to examine during metal detecting session Phoenix: Hmm... It doesn't look like there's anything here. Gumshoe: Hey, pal! All you gotta do is watch the detector and let IT tell YOU what's where, OK! (Changed from [Hey, pal! You've gotta watch the CHECK gauge and wait for it to flash, OK!?] in the original release) Phoenix: (Alright, already... I'm not exactly a wiz at machinery, you know...)\n-- The Real Murderer --Iris: I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Sister Iris! Your testimony has changed quite a bit since yesterday. You stated yesterday that, on the night of the murder, you didn't go to the Inner Temple. Godot: Godot: Did she now? Too bad for you, what she said yesterday doesn't mean much today. By the way, where were you when she claimed that she didn't go? Phoenix: Umm, I... It was in the Inner Temple's Training Hall... Godot: A private conversation between the two of you does not constitute testimony. That would be properly described as hearsay. Judge: Hmm... What do you have to say, witness? Iris: I-I just couldn't tell him the truth at that time. Mystic Maya... She's your girlfriend, isn't she? Phoenix: ...! Iris: I... I didn't want to be the one to break it to you that I saw her commit murder... Judge: There, there... We all understand how difficult this is for you. Now then, let's continue with the testimony. What did you witness in the temple garden...? Iris: Well, Your Honor...Iris: I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're saying that the victim attacked Maya... I mean Ms. Fey? Iris: Y-Yes... It was a truly frightening scene. Mystic Maya was struck hard on the head and looked like she was going to collapse. Phoenix: What were you doing at the time? Iris: Um... Phoenix: Why didn't you stop them from fighting!? Iris: I-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wright... I was... I was frightened... I couldn't move... I couldn't even speak, I was in such shock... Judge: Hmm... That's perfectly understandable, my dear. Phoenix: (This doesn't sound right... I don't believe this testimony for a minute!) Judge: ...What happened after that?Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey. Iris: Ho-How can you be so sure...? Phoenix: Because the victim's real name was not \"Elise Deauxnim\". Her real name was... \"Misty Fey\". Judge: ...\"Fey\"? Iris: Aaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey! Judge: Wh-Who is this Misty Fey? Is she related to...? Phoenix: Misty Fey is the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She is also... ...the mother of Maya Fey! Judge: A-Are you serious!? Iris: Is it... really true? Mr. Wright...!? Was Elise Deauxnim actually the great Mystic Misty!? Phoenix: There's no doubt about it. (It looks like Iris had no idea...) Iris: I can hardly believe it... Phoenix: The idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing! Godot: ...Ugh...! Judge: Order in the court!! There's no doubt about it. This certainly is odd. I find it difficult to believe that a mother would try to kill her own daughter! Godot: Ha...! If it turns out that I'm wrong about this... I'll quit my day job and open up a coffee house. Judge: Hmm... Godot: I'd like to believe that domestic violence cases like these never occur, but... ...unfortunately, they're all too common. That's why people drink bitter coffee, you know. Judge: You've brought to light a very interesting fact, Mr. Wright... But I must agree with the prosecution that domestic violence is not all that rare. Phoenix: Y-You don't mean...!? Judge: The fact that they were mother and daughter doesn't itself disprove the witness's claims. I think it would be best if we returned to the testimony at hand. Iris: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Phoenix: (Somehow... It looks like I'm gonna have to find another contradiction in her testimony. Something more conclusive than this!)Iris: While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She moved in to deliver a fatal strike? Iris: ...Yes, I'm sure of it. She threw down her staff and reached into her robe for a weapon... Phoenix: Wait a minute! What was this weapon...? Iris: It-It was... some kind of dagger. Phoenix: (A dagger, huh...?) And Elise Deauxnim tried to stab her with this weapon? ...To kill Ms. Fey? Iris: Yes... Exactly. Phoenix: ... Godot: Ha...! You look like I did after I mistakenly took a swig of Worcestershire sauce. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Do you have a problem with the testimony we're hearing from your client, Lawyer Boy? Phoenix: (Hmm... Do I have a problem with Iris's testimony...?) No problem Phoenix: (Iris is my client... I'd better not press her too hard...) The defense has no objection to Ms. Iris's testimony. Godot: Ha...! You should try some nice, sweet caf√© con leche at least once, Trite... Judge: Very well, let's continue with your testimony. What happened to Ms. Fey when she was attacked by the victim? Leads back to cross-examination There is one thing... Phoenix: ...Your Honor. I have a small problem with the witness's testimony. Judge: Y-You do? But this witness is your own client! Phoenix: Yes, well... N-Nevertheless... Godot: ...That's fine. Witness, let's add your last statement to the testimony. Iris: Y-Yes, sir. Judge: H-Hey! Just a moment! It's my job to say that... Godot: ...Listen, gramps. I won't say it again. Final judgment will be rendered by me! Judge: Nnngghh...! Godot: ...OK, now. Let's continue. Adds statement \"She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!\"Press (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: She moved in to deliver a fatal strike? Iris: ...Yes, I'm sure of it. She threw down her staff and reached into her robe for a weapon... Phoenix: Wait a minute! What was this weapon...? Iris: It-It was... some kind of dagger. Phoenix: (A dagger, huh...?) And Elise Deauxnim tried to stab her with this weapon? ...To kill Ms. Fey? Iris: Yes...

Phoenix: (Somehow... It looks like I'm gonna have to find another contradiction in her testimony. Something more conclusive than this!)Iris: She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She threw her staff away? Iris: Mystic Elise was trying to kill Mystic Maya. I think that's why she wanted a more lethal weapon. Judge: It's true... It's not easy to inflict a deadly blow with a staff. Phoenix: Sister Iris, let me make sure I've got this straight. The victim herself chose to throw away her staff? Iris: Y-Yes. That's what I saw... Judge: Is there anything odd about that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ... (Yeah, it's odd alright.) Iris: Mystic Elise attacked Mystic Maya with the dagger. I'm sure of this.Present Victim's Staff (if Elise Deauxnim profile was presented on any statement other than first) Phoenix: Phoenix: Sister Iris... There's something strange about your version of events. Iris: Huh...? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim throwing her staff away makes no sense at all to me. Iris: B-But all you can do with a staff is hit someone... Phoenix: Naturally you wouldn't know this, Sister Iris, but... ...the victim's staff had a special feature about it. As you can see, it's a sword. Iris: Ah...! Phoenix: If Elise Deauxnim really had wanted to kill Maya Fey... ...she wouldn't have needed to use a separate dagger! Not when she already had a beautiful blade in her hands already! Leads to: \"Order! Order in the court!\"Present Victim's Staff (if Elise Deauxnim profile was not presented on any statement other than first) Phoenix: Phoenix: Sister Iris...

Not when she already had a beautiful blade in her hands already! ...Well, Sister Iris? What do you have to say? Iris: Uhh, err, I... Godot: Godot: ...That was an impressive bit of investigating, Trite. I never would have thought there was a sword hidden in that staff. But even so... How should I put this? Phoenix: ...! Godot: A long sword is unwieldy, and thus quite ineffective in close-quarters combat. Maybe that's why she chose a dagger over her blade. Phoenix: Um, well... Godot: Anyway, the type of weapon she chose to use isn't what's important. The important thing is that she tried to kill Maya Fey. As long as there's nothing strange about that, there's no problem with her testimony. Phoenix: (But there is something strange about this whole testimony!) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? The prosecution has a point. Phoenix: ...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument. Iris: M-Mr. Wright...! Phoenix: I have here another piece of evidence that shows that this testimony can't be trusted. Because Ms. Elise Deauxnim would never attempt to take the life of Maya Fey! Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Godot? Godot: If you ask me... ...the only thing that seems strange is the angle of Mr. Trite's index finger. Phoenix: Eh... Godot: Trite, sticking your finger in an electrical outlet might be safer for you. Otherwise it might get bitten off the next time you poke it in the wrong place! Phoenix: Arrrrgh...! (I still don't think that Ms. Deauxnim would ever attack Maya... If you think about their relationship, it's obvious!) Judge: ...Why don't you think it over one more time. Leads back to: \"...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument.\" Phoenix: ...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey.

Godot: Godot: Tsk, tsk, tsk, Trite. If your mug is filled with black and bitter suspicions... The only way to get rid of them is to drink them down quick... ...Like this! Phoenix: Umm... I know that's supposed be a metaphor, but I don't get it. Godot: There's only one thing you need to \"get\", Trite. It's called evidence... Now hurry up... Before my next cup gets cold!

Something more conclusive than this!)Phoenix: (I'd like to avoid the whole spirit channeling thing if I can... Not only would it be inadmissible as evidence... ...but I think it might actually hurt our standing with the judge. First I need to pick her testimony apart and expose the unnatural-sounding parts... I don't know why Iris would tell a story like this... ...but there are two things I noticed that just don't add up!)Judge: Order! Order in the court! Upon first hearing the witness's testimony, it seemed natural enough. ...However. In light of some facts that have just been presented...Iris: ...Judge: One, that the victim supposedly threw away a sword during a fight... ...and two, that the two people battling to the death were mother and daughter... Despite the facts being believable when taken on their own... ...when taken together, the entire story seems difficult to believe.Godot: ...Listen. There's nothing in this world that is impossible. Except for one little thing.Judge: Yes? What is this one little impossible thing...?Godot: Ha...! You still don't get it. You think maybe my beans are under-roasted, but you have no idea gramps.Phoenix: Umm... Could you get to your point?Godot: I heard this witness's confession this morning... ...just as I had taken the first sip of my eighth cup of morning coffee.Judge: ...You're going to ruin your health, my friend.Godot: Anyway, after hearing this woman's confession... I had a detective who loves to investigate sent to the scene of the crime. And... he discovered this little beauty.Judge: Is that the dagger the witness testified to seeing...?Godot: Obviously, Your Honor... But do you not notice something else?Judge: ...Now that you mention it, if you look closely, there appears to be blood on it! (Changed from [...Now that you mention it, if you look closely, there appears to be a bloodstain!] in the original release)Phoenix: Wh-Where did you find that? I didn't see that when I investigated the crime scene!Godot: ...Did you investigate the pine tree at the crime scene?Phoenix: Huh? The pine tree...?Godot: This dagger was stuck in the back side of the pine tree. When the last blow was struck, ending the violent battle between the two women... ...this little baby was thrown in the direction of the back of the pine tree.Judge: Which means... the blood on this dagger belongs to the victim, correct!?Godot: Ha...! Were you even listening, old man? I first heard this confession this morning. Just as I had taken the first sip of my 13th cup of morning coffee.Phoenix: (Didn't you say it was your 8th just a few minutes ago!?)Godot: I didn't have enough time to get the blood analyzed on such short notice.Judge: In any case, the court will accept the dagger as evidence. Furthermore, I order that a blood test be performed on it immediately!Godot: This is my sweetheart. Make sure you treat her right.Judge: ...Bailiff! Get this piece of evidence to the crime lab for testing immediately!Dagger added to the Court Record.Judge: Now then... The testimony we've just heard had numerous unbelievable aspects to it. However! After having found the very dagger the witness spoke of... ...I believe we can consider her testimony to be credible.Godot: Cute girls never lie. Ever.Judge: In any case, witness... If you could please testify again to this court.Iris: Umm... About what, Your Honor?Judge: About the incident you saw... The battle between the two women!Iris: ...Yes, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- The Battle --Iris: Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff... But then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon! Suddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern. That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise! Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.Judge: ...That was a very heart-breaking story.Iris: I don't know if there were any bad feelings between them, but... It had been 17 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. ...Perhaps they simply didn't recognize each other anymore...Judge: Hmm... That seems reasonable. Now then, Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Battle --Iris: Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Iris, where were you standing when you witnessed all this? Iris: Umm... What do you mean? Phoenix: Well, if either of them had noticed you... ...they might not have continued their battle. Iris: I... I wonder if that's true... The two of them... They were standing near the garden's stone lantern. I... I was watching the whole thing from behind. It was dark where the two of them were, so... I think that's why they didn't see me. Judge: Hmm... So it was dark in the garden when the murder took place... Tell me, what did Ms. Maya Fey do after she was struck?Iris: But then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened to the victim's staff then? Iris: I-I'm not sure. The area was very dark, so... I really couldn't see. I think it got knocked away somewhere as the fight escalated. Judge: That makes sense... That would explain the need for the dagger. Iris: Mystic Elise raised the dagger to strike. But Mystic Maya dodged it at the last second. The dagger struck the lantern and fell to the ground. And then at some point, Mystic Maya picked it up...! Phoenix: (Nothing sounds especially strange yet...) Judge: What did the victim do when the weapon was stolen from her?Iris: Suddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're saying that Maya Fey turned the tables on the victim? Iris: Y-Yes... ...But Mystic Maya wasn't herself at the time. After all... Her life was in danger... Phoenix: (I still can't believe it... The idea of Maya cornering someone at knifepoint! It's just silly!) Godot: As they say... \"A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal\". Phoenix: I believe the correct description of a cornered fox is \"scared and petrified\". Godot: ... Your animal analogies have grown tiresome! Phoenix: (You were the one who started it!) Judge: Anyway... So, after Maya Fey backed the victim into the stone lantern, what happened next?Iris: That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that's what you saw!? Iris: ... Yes, I'm almost certain. Phoenix: \"Almost\"...? Iris: The garden was dark... I couldn't really tell who was who. Phoenix: (What did she just say!?) S-So in other words, it could have been someone else entirely...! Godot: Godot: We know that Maya Fey was at the Inner Temple that night. And that the woman that was killed was Elise Deauxnim. Isn't it fairly obvious who attacked who? Phoenix: Nnrgh... (I don't have anything to counter that yet...) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Please continue with your testimony. Iris: ...Yes, Your Honor. The two of them faced each other for a moment... Then Mystic Maya rushed straight into Mystic Elise! Then Mystic Elise doubled over and fell to the ground. Judge: Hmm... So she was stabbed in the stomach, huh? Iris: Yes...Present Elise's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!\"Iris: Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did that dagger go? Iris: ...I have no idea. It was dark and I couldn't see. Godot: According to the detective who found the dagger... ...it was stuck into the pine tree in the garden. Most likely it was flung towards the tree after the struggle. Judge: That is the most likely explanation, yes. Phoenix: After being stabbed in the stomach, did the victim collapse right away? Iris: ... Now that I think of it... ...she seemed to stare at Mystic Maya for a while. And Mystic Maya stood there, not moving an inch... It felt for a moment like time had just stopped. Judge: Hmm... Iris: But then, suddenly, as if the spell had worn off, Mystic Elise fell over...Phoenix: (It seems like a reasonable story at first... But... there's one thing that is completely impossible. The very idea of Maya stabbing someone... That alone is impossible! Which means... ...this faulty testimony must contain another contradiction in it somewhere.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

    "cot": "Evidence 9, the Victim's Staff, reveals that Elise Deauxnim's staff secretly contained a sword, making it a potent weapon. In Testimony 3, Iris claims \"That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!\", based on her earlier assertion that Elise Deauxnim had thrown away her staff to switch to a dagger. This doesn't make logical sense: if Elise wanted to lethally attack Maya, she would not discard a staff that is actually a concealed sword in favor of a less powerful dagger‚Äîespecially since no one but Elise would have known about the sword. Thus, this testimony about Maya stabbing Deauxnim, after Deauxnim throws her staff away (rendering herself nearly defenseless), is contradicted by the knowledge that the staff was, in fact, a hidden sword.\n",

The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means \"7 Branched Sword\". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare... February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Hey, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah? What is it? Maya: You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you? Phoenix: Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all. Maya: But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right? Phoenix: Um... I guess so, yeah. Maya: Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up! Phoenix: (Pearls...?) Pearl: So! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick! Phoenix: ...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face? Pearl: It's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special! Phoenix: ...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.) Maya: \"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true! Phoenix: I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me. Maya: It's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training! Phoenix: (Now I definitely don't want to go...) Maya: You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there! Phoenix: Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious? Pearl: Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us! Maya: Yeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"! Phoenix: Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway. Maya: Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff! Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"? Pearl: No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall! Phoenix: ... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places. Maya: Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!? Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!? Phoenix: Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!? Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun... Maya: Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick? Phoenix: (Th-This girl... I-It's...!) Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence. Dahlia: Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me! Phoenix: But... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...) Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... I'll go. Maya: Huh...? Phoenix: Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go. Maya: Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!? Pearl: Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!? \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls. Phoenix: (Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.) February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Brrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick! Phoenix: Maybe you should put on something warmer for a change! Maya: W-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...) Pearl: Wow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple! Maya: P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo! ???: Well, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple! Maya: Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo! ???: Oh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold. Phoenix: What's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--! ???: Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside. Maya: Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass-- ???: Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. Bikini: I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini. Maya: B-B-B-Bikini...!? Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! Maya: It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Pearl: R-Reckless...? Maya: \"Wa ha ha\"...? Pearl: Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day. Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir√©e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! ‚ô™Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!‚ô™ Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask‚òÜDeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:¬†??? Time:¬†???Location:¬†??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record. Ami Fey statue (subsequent times) Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir.

Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim.

Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry...

Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!?

Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...? Edgeworth: Apparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all. Iris: ... ...... Edgeworth: This is no time to be embarrassed! Iris: I-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing. Edgeworth: Worry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him! Iris: Does that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...? Edgeworth: ...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand. Iris: Sister Bikini... Edgeworth: She claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct? Iris: ... That is correct. It wasn't me. Edgeworth: ...Very well, then. Iris: Um... Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: You are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed... Edgeworth: Don't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements. (Changed from [Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.] in the original release) Iris: I-I see... (Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people. Iris: ... Edgeworth: But right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what my friend told me once. (Changed from [That's what a friend of mine told me once.] in the original release) Iris: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I simply ask that you watch and decide for yourself... (Changed from [You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide...] in the original release) ...whether or not I am fit to do the task I have been entrusted. (Changed from [...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.] in the original release) Iris: ... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands. February 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Judge: ...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Judge: I'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant... ???: ???: The prosecution... stands ready. Judge: A-And you are...? von Karma: Franziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy. Judge: V-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma? von Karma: ... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case. Judge: Y-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: I'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once... Edgeworth: ...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor. Judge: Ms. von Karma? Do you have anything to say? von Karma: ... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office. Judge: There... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack! von Karma: ...I told you, there is no such weakling! Judge: Wh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...I have no objection to the whip. Judge: Y-You don't...? Edgeworth: The prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today! von Karma: This promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers! Edgeworth: ...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic. Judge: Allow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah! von Karma: ...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible! von Karma: The murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue. Judge: The sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: There is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime. Judge: ...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand! Edgeworth: (And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!) von Karma: ...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please. Judge: H-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight! Edgeworth: If I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release) Judge: Bailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please! von Karma: ...Once again. Your name and occupation, please. Bikini: Little old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone. Judge: ... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah! von Karma: ...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once! Judge: Y-You want me to leave!? Bikini: No need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Edgeworth: In any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question. Bikini: That's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that... Judge: Let us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh! Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Judge: Hmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple? Bikini: ...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...) von Karma: There is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple...? Bikini: Well, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right? Judge: We'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam. Bikini: ...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training. Edgeworth: And how exactly do you help with this process...? Bikini: It is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising. von Karma: Like a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies. Edgeworth: (A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place? Bikini: Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Violently...? Bikini: That's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...? Bikini: That's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off! Bikini: So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You \"left Iris to help\"... With what? Bikini: What do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper. Judge: Wasn't it your place to remain with the disciple? Bikini: Well, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away. Edgeworth: Just to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct? Bikini: Yes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions. Present Iris's Testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all. Bikini: Well, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: In that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all! Bikini: N... No...! She said that...? von Karma: von Karma: A defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi. von Karma: ...! Bikini: But that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...! Judge: Hmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah! von Karma: ...All people lie. That is my belief. Judge: Why am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question... Bikini: Dear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you? Judge: A-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I... Bikini: My memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter! Judge: Then... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence. Edgeworth: ...Understood, Your Honor. (I was na√Øve to think that alone would do the trick.) Judge: Then please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination. Changes statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\" Bikini: Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure that you're not making a mistake...? Bikini: ...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor! Edgeworth: Nngh...! Bikini: Iris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake! Judge: ...An excellent finish there, witness. Edgeworth: (Still, I have to wonder...) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\" Bikini: There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath? Bikini: My back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all. Edgeworth: How long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking? Bikini: ... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind! Edgeworth: ...? Bikini: I bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones... Edgeworth: W-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah! von Karma: ...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth. Judge: The lowest of the low. Edgeworth: (Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?) Bikini: Anyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so... Bikini: It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The crime took place in the courtyard, correct...? Bikini: When you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard. von Karma: That's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case! Judge: Hmm... That certainly seems to be true. Edgeworth: (There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.) Edgeworth: ...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct? Bikini: Of course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute... von Karma: von Karma: H-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!? Edgeworth: That's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung. von Karma: W... What!? Edgeworth: ...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release) Bikini: Well well well! Edgeworth: (It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...) Judge: Order! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa! von Karma: ...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you? Bikini: Spares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them. Judge: I see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh? Bikini: Each nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned... Judge: Hmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah! von Karma: If there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here! Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: (I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.) Judge: ...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision. Bikini: I-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this... von Karma: Sister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple! Edgeworth: (Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.) Witness Testimony -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Judge: You saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that. Edgeworth: (This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...) von Karma: I would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours? Cross Examination -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple? Bikini: Let me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge. von Karma: Still, you never made it back there that night, did you? Bikini: T-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall... Bikini: And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you heard a noise...? Bikini: \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: ...That could only be the sound of the victim falling. Bikini: It's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that. Judge: But then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground? Bikini: ... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha... Judge: Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah! von Karma: The next one to laugh gets a whipping! Bikini: Well. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and... Bikini: Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims. Bikini: Hey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to... Edgeworth: The murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can! Bikini: Hmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time! Edgeworth: ...Please, don't keep us in suspense. Bikini: Her hood! von Karma: Her hood...? Bikini: That's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right? Edgeworth: ...Urk! von Karma: Hah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: What do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important? It's not important Edgeworth: (...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them. Judge: Hmm... Judge: Very well. ...Please, continue with your testimony. von Karma: Hmph... Leads back to cross-examination It's important Edgeworth: (This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony. von Karma: Heh... Miles Edgeworth. von Karma: If you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip! Judge: Witness. Add that statement to your testimony. Bikini: ...No problem. Adds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" Bikini: Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You are sure about that...? Bikini: Yes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it! Edgeworth: ...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself. Bikini: Anyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out. von Karma: Like me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip. Edgeworth: (At least then it might bite you and not someone else...) Bikini: Iris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it! Judge: ...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh. Bikini: Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct? Judge: Which means... the victim's room was on the second floor? Bikini: No, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building. Judge: I see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct? Bikini: Yes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all... Bikini: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What makes you so sure of all this...? Bikini: It's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: You're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height. Judge: Hmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then. Bikini: Yep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (There's only two of them working there...!) von Karma: What's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark? Edgeworth: ... Present Elise's Autopsy Report Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\" Edgeworth: (...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.) Edgeworth: ...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway. Bikini: Oh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter! Edgeworth: However... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report? von Karma: T-The autopsy report...? Edgeworth: The victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed. von Karma: Ah...! Judge: T-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here! Edgeworth: The scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!? von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree? von Karma: Th-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Were there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: She was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree? Judge: W-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room. Judge: ...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah! von Karma: I'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood. Judge: When it produces the most blood...? von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: Indeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound. Judge: That's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking! von Karma: We have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions! Judge: Order! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events! Edgeworth: (I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!) von Karma: ...Hmph... Judge: It seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate! Bikini: Don't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood! von Karma: Sister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here. Edgeworth: (...With the whip?) Bikini: ...Oh, boy. Alright, alright... Witness Testimony -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. I've never seen so much blood before... That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Judge: Hmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory... von Karma: Von Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...) Cross Examination -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time... was the victim bleeding? Bikini: Well... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then. von Karma: ...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound. Edgeworth: In any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!? Bikini: Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Think carefully. This is very important. Bikini: It's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.) von Karma: The victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out? Bikini: That's right... Bikini: The whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah... Judge: It goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding. von Karma: ...Nothing out of place here. Edgeworth: (Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.) Present Shichishito Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\" Bikini: I've never seen so much blood before... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood? Bikini: T-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too... von Karma: When the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner. Edgeworth: Wh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?) Judge: Hmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me... Edgeworth: (What should I do...? Press this point further?) Stop here Edgeworth: (I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding! Leads back to cross-examination Press further Edgeworth: Going back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...? Bikini: Well, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw. Judge: W-What did you see? Bikini: Maybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day. Edgeworth: Pulling the sword out...? Bikini: Well, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\". Judge: Witness! You will add this statement to your testimony! Bikini: Oh... Was that important...!? Edgeworth: (More important than you can imagine...) Adds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...? Bikini: No mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day! Edgeworth: ...Don't you think that's a bit odd? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Why would the killer pull out the sword? von Karma: What...? Edgeworth: If all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Indeed... It is strange, now that you mention it. Edgeworth: (I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...) von Karma: A-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness? Bikini: That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Now, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct? Bikini: Well... I was unconscious... von Karma: How long were you out for? Bikini: I don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually. Judge: Hmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation! Bikini: Well, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you. Edgeworth: ...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...? Bikini: And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct? Bikini: Just stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough. Bikini: But to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...! von Karma: Truly, a heinous, despicable crime. Edgeworth: It is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily... von Karma: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem? Edgeworth: Exactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that? von Karma: ...! Judge: Hmmmmm... No, I don't think I can. von Karma: ... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts! Bikini: That's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself... Edgeworth: (\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.) Edgeworth: (There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.) Edgeworth: Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here. Bikini: W-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. von Karma: What contradictions are you talking about? Edgeworth: In the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities! Judge: What do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah! von Karma: Explain yourself! Edgeworth: To start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that. von Karma: von Karma: \"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose! Judge: The objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly. von Karma: T-That's... Edgeworth: We also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: T-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction. Judge: Y-You've still got more!? Edgeworth: ...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it? von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: If this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword! von Karma: Noooooo! Judge: Order! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa! von Karma: Bravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that! Judge: But what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but... Edgeworth: ...Having come this far, there can only be one answer. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito! Judge: W-Whaaaaaaaaat!? von Karma: A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool. Edgeworth: Let's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon? Bikini: W-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it... Edgeworth: ...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah! von Karma: So maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object. Judge: Hmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises. Judge: The obvious... question? Edgeworth: ...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: It goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found. von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Answer the question, Ms. von Karma! von Karma: ... No evidence of that kind was found. Judge: Hmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast! Bikini: Excuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually... von Karma: ...What is it, Sister? Bikini: I was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there... Judge: ... What exactly are you going on aboot here? Bikini: The murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of! Edgeworth: You what!? von Karma: Well then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister. Edgeworth: (Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?) Witness Testimony -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Judge: Hmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time. Bikini: Well. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know. von Karma: Quite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph. Judge: A snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory... von Karma: The tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge! Tracks Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: ...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon! Edgeworth: (Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...You are sure about the time? Bikini: Yes... I was worried about it, after all. Judge: Why was that? Bikini: Because I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.) von Karma: Please continue, Sister. Bikini: And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct? Bikini: Right, right, the one who trampled me. Edgeworth: (It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...) Bikini: There isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him? Edgeworth: He had forgotten it at home, apparently. von Karma: What a na√Øve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too! Bikini: Anyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell. Bikini: And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited. Bikini: That's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls! Edgeworth: Now, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived? Bikini: Yes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate. von Karma: So... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time. Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?) Press further Edgeworth: (...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time? Bikini: Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean? Judge: What do you mean, eh? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used. Bikini: Ah! I see! I never thought of that! Judge: Hmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too! von Karma: ...Of course you did. Edgeworth: Then answer the question please, witness. Bikini: ... I don't often go around touching hot engines... Edgeworth: ...Hmm. Bikini: However... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it. Judge: Snow...? Bikini: Yes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow... Edgeworth: (There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!) Judge: It seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh! von Karma: How long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Stop here Edgeworth: (It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Judge: How long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Bikini: It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking. Bikini: Ah! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain? Judge: I think that's why the question was asked in the first place... Bikini: ...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch. Judge: Hmm... Crunch. Bikini: ...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then... Bikini: Anyway, the killer must have used it! Bikini: Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Refresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...? Bikini: Like I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes. von Karma: It's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile... Edgeworth: ...I have to concede that is more than enough time. von Karma: Is that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Bikini: ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: While it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here. Judge: Oh? And what would this mystery element be? Edgeworth: The killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods? Judge: Hmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah! von Karma: Turning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor. Judge: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (She's as over the top as always...) von Karma: A-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Edgeworth: (Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...) Edgeworth: I admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder. von Karma: You've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: However... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks? von Karma: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Iris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back. Bikini: ... Ah...! You're right! von Karma: Hmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...? von Karma: On the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it! Judge: I see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow. von Karma: What do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?) It's flawless. Edgeworth: ...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow. Edgeworth: I do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim. von Karma: ...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night? Bikini: Well... that would be...! von Karma: ...You can't hide it. I already know the answer. Bikini: ......... It could only be Iris. Judge: A-And the reason being...!? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. von Karma: A key... that the defendant is responsible for! Edgeworth: Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment. Judge: What is it, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: There is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim! Judge: ... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!? Edgeworth: Nngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!) Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" There is a contradiction. Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" Edgeworth: The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible. von Karma: ... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction? Edgeworth: ...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me. Judge: On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow! Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Witness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime. Bikini: Like I said! It was around 11. Edgeworth: ...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder. Judge: The... weather report...? Edgeworth: Snow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Therefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up! von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! Judge: Very well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things! Edgeworth: ... von Karma: Answer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!? Judge: Ah, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah! von Karma: Forecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM! Judge: Hmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh! Edgeworth: W-What!? (How did she pull that off!?) Judge: \"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this. Edgeworth: (I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony. von Karma: Hah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!? Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ... Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: It looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth... Edgeworth: ...! Judge: And to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry. Edgeworth: (This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.) von Karma: Respond! Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Even if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple! Leads back to: \"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\" Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Here is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...? Judge: ... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case. Edgeworth: ... Nothing else...? Judge: Nothing else. von Karma: Oh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Nngh...! Edgeworth: (According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!) Leads back to: \"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\" Edgeworth: Ultimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed... von Karma: That's right. But proving that is... Edgeworth: Incredibly easy. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: If we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why! von Karma: Gnnngh! Edgeworth: In other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks! von Karma: Aaaaah! Judge: Order! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah! von Karma: J-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing. von Karma: Of course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release) Edgeworth: Then when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained. Judge: Hmmmmm... Bikini: Can I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me... von Karma: ...What does, Sister? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. Edgeworth: ...! von Karma: Furthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder! Bikini: ...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple... Edgeworth: (But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...) Bikini: The snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot. Judge: ...That sounds right. Bikini: But... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge. von Karma: Y-You must have just failed to see it, Sister. Bikini: Maybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too... Edgeworth: B-But that... isn't possible! Judge: Order! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean? von Karma: ...Nngh... Edgeworth: So then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple! Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...) Judge: ... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release) Bikini: Yes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know. Judge: But then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile! Edgeworth: (A witness, huh...) Judge: Was there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night? Bikini: ... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do. Judge: Hmmmm... That's a shame. Edgeworth: (Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release) Judge: R-Really!? von Karma: ...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...? Edgeworth: I don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind. Judge: Which are...? Edgeworth: First... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder. von Karma: ...And the second being? Edgeworth: This individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!? Present Larry Butz profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: Just what is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth...? Are you saying that... this is the person who was near Dusky Bridge that night? Edgeworth: I-I did think so, however... Aaah! von Karma: You're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Cool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!) Judge: Hmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual... Did they really see the snowmobile that night? Leads back to: \"I don't know for sure if he saw it or not...\" Judge: This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"... Edgeworth: This is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim. Judge: Her student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder? Edgeworth: T-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason. von Karma: And so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw? Edgeworth: I intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom. Judge: Summon this youth as a witness immediately! von Karma: ... I have no choice, do I? Edgeworth: I believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him. Judge: ...Very well. Edgeworth: (Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!) Judge: ...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness. von Karma: ...Understood, Your Honor. Judge: Good... Well then! Court is now in recess! To be continued. February 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Excuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say... Edgeworth: Iris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene. Iris: ...Alright. I'll help you any way I can. Edgeworth: First, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: ...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile? Iris: ... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me. Edgeworth: So it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge? Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: Iris... Iris: I can't... tell you about that... yet. Edgeworth: \"Yet\"...? Iris: Not until her safety is confirmed... Edgeworth: Her? Iris: The safety of the acolyte... Edgeworth: (The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life. Edgeworth: ... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough. February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: ...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...? von Karma: During the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery. Edgeworth: Suspicious behavior...? von Karma: He was sketching something... Very intensely. Judge: Dare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained? von Karma: He drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip. Judge: ... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah! von Karma: Anyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here! Edgeworth: (It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...) Butz: Ouch! von Karma: ...Your sketch is in contempt of this court! Butz: H-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch! von Karma: You tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct? Butz: L-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\". Edgeworth: ...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...? Butz: I know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it? Judge: Working in the fields...? Edgeworth: I presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope. Butz: Th-That's it! Thanks, buddy! Edgeworth: (It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...) Butz: I just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model! von Karma: ... Butz: So see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Judge: Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Stop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man! Judge: Refrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now! Butz: Waaaah... This is almost too much for me...! Witness Testimony -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... I didn't see a s-snowmobile! I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) The girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me... I'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!? Judge: Witness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony! Butz: I-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!? Judge: ... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex. Edgeworth: ...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people! Butz: Yeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy! Judge: ...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time. Cross Examination -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Judge: What ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: This one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: So, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way. Butz: OK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a \"lodge\", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right? Edgeworth: ... von Karma: See? You can do it if you try. Butz: Heh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: ...There is only one issue here. What you saw at Dusky Bridge. Butz: I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"A number of times\"...? How many? Butz: Maybe... five times? I went once every twenty minutes. Edgeworth: Which means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night? Butz: You bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands! Judge: Love, you say...? Edgeworth: It was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter. Judge: B-Blackmail...!? Butz: No, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh! von Karma: You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness! Judge: So... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh! Butz: Um... well... You see... Edgeworth: (Being called those names doesn't seem to bother him at all...) Butz: I didn't see a s-snowmobile! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Larry! You really didn't see it? Butz: H-H-Hey! No need to hit your desk! I can hear you! ...I didn't see it! I didn't see a s-s-snowmobile! Edgeworth: ... Larry. Say \"snowmobile\" for me, please? Butz: S-S-S-Snowmobile. Edgeworth: If you truly have nothing to hide... ...then why are you stammering like you just flew over a cuckoo's nest!? Butz: Sh-Shut up! W-W-What is this!? I don't know! Don't ask me! Edgeworth: (It seems that I'll need to start from a more obvious contradiction. I'm going to strike the blow that will finally get him to spill the beans!) Butz: I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You didn't meet anyone? Butz: That's right. Because I've got nothing to do with this! And I'm just here to buy some viridian paint, OK!? Come on, I expect to see those crimson lake faces! Now! Judge: ... It would appear that simply pressing him isn't going to be enough, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry Butz...\" Edgeworth: (It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...) Edgeworth: Larry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble... Butz: I'm sorry...! Edgeworth: But... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction. Butz: Edgey! Are you... trying to console me? Judge: It certainly doesn't sound that way to me. Edgeworth: However... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create! Butz: Waaah... You're totally pinning this on me... Edgeworth: ...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz! Butz: ... That's right. Me, in the flesh. Judge: Hmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change! Butz: B-But...! What do you want me to do, then!? Edgeworth: Larry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well... Judge: I'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder? Witness Testimony -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. That's when I ran into Nick. Judge: Hmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you? von Karma: So... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire? Butz: It was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall. von Karma: W-What did you say!? Edgeworth: Oh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release) von Karma: ...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release) Judge: Now, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half? Butz: Well, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess. Judge: Hmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...? Butz: I set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too. Edgeworth: ...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end. von Karma: Because they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they? Butz: Shut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her. Butz: I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This \"light\" was, of course... Butz: Lightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah! von Karma: ...Or a little like that? Butz: Waaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda! Judge: Witness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge? Butz: Well, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so... Butz: I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Seeing that, what did you do? Butz: What do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart! von Karma: And that's why you went to take a look at the bridge? Butz: Well. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind. Judge: Hmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness. Butz: There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that? Butz: Hmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\" von Karma: How far is this small shack you were in from the bridge? Butz: Hold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk? Edgeworth: And how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there? Butz: Like I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare! Edgeworth: (...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?) Not right now. Edgeworth: (I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Why didn't you call anyone? Edgeworth: ...Larry. Let me ask you one thing. Butz: What is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face? Edgeworth: Why didn't you call anyone? Butz: Huh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Normally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct? Butz: ... Well, of course I thought of doing that. Judge: So then... let's hear why you didn't! Butz: H-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" Why did you go to the bridge? Edgeworth: So you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so? Butz: W-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there. Edgeworth: If that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning. Judge: In which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness! Butz: M-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" Butz: That's when I ran into Nick. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did Phoenix Wright look when you met him? Butz: Hmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment. von Karma: How far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge? Butz: On his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say. Judge: ...And that's when the murder was reported? Butz: That's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge! Butz: I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright? Butz: Y-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway. Edgeworth: (What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!) von Karma: It was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct? Butz: Yeah. That's pretty much it. More or less. Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\" Butz: I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you decided to go and see what was happening? Butz: That's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special? Edgeworth: (Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce \"spectacle\"?) Judge: Life seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt... Butz: Well, my motto is to \"hit life back as hard as I can.\" A-Agah! von Karma: ...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip. Edgeworth: (...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.) Edgeworth: Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not... Butz: What the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien! Edgeworth: But your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time. Butz: I've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those. Edgeworth: ...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct? Butz: Yeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less. Edgeworth: ...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM. Butz: ...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act. Edgeworth: That is impossible. von Karma: ...What do you mean? Edgeworth: 11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time! von Karma: ...! Butz: Ah! Excuse me! I-I have an objection! Judge: You do? Butz: Edgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah! von Karma: ...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that! Edgeworth: ...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM! von Karma: And why not!? Edgeworth: It is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM! Judge: Which means... what, exactly? Edgeworth: Wright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!? Butz: Urk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh! von Karma: ...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem! Butz: Yeah! Not much of a problem at all! Edgeworth: Really...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident? Judge: Yes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release) Edgeworth: And therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release) von Karma: Th-That's what it sounds like... Edgeworth: Ah, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude. Edgeworth: ...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time. Butz: Listen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!? Edgeworth: Y-Yes... Butz: I may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah! von Karma: ...Then say it! Judge: Very well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!? Witness Testimony -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Judge: Hmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk... Butz: That's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch! Edgeworth: (...Including the truth, from the sound of it!) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts? Edgeworth: Not at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains. Judge: And what would that be? Edgeworth: This is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him! Butz: Hah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey! Cross Examination -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tell us, Larry... Butz: My name is Laurice! Get it right! Mistakes like that are what keep you from being popular with the ladies like I am! Judge: ... Just who exactly are you!? Butz: I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Apprentice extraordinaire! Edgeworth: That's what he calls himself, in any case. Judge: ...Then you are... an artist? Butz: Of course! I'm an artist, the real thing! Edgeworth: Yet again, that's what he calls himself. von Karma: ...Names mean nothing. There is only one issue I care to discuss. What were you doing? Edgeworth: (That is a very big issue, indeed.) Butz: Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: S-Sketching!? The burning bridge? Butz: The burning bridge and everything that came with it! Edgeworth: ... What? \"Came with it\"...? Butz: You want to hear this from my lips, do you, Edgey!? Y-You'll regret this! That sketch of mine is... Gaaah! von Karma: ...Enough. Just take that ridiculous sketch of yours out already, witness! Butz: ... W-W-W-What are you talking about? I don't know what you mean! Judge: That does indeed appear to be the fastest solution. ...I'll leave it to you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (What should I do...? I've got a terrible feeling that the instant this sketch is revealed... ...the entire world may be changed by what is depicted there...!) Leave it alone Edgeworth: ...I cannot recommend looking at the sketch. His \"works of art\" are a force of nature best measured on the Richter scale. Butz: That's right! They'll shake your heart to pieces! Judge: Hmmmm... This courtroom has yet to meet earthquake standards! I think we'd better pass! ...In which case, let us turn to other leads. Leads back to cross-examination Look at the sketch Edgeworth: ...Larry. I wonder if you could show us your sketch. Please? Butz: ... Well, well... Even I couldn't have imagined it'd turn out like this. Edgeworth: ...Imagined what? Butz: That Laurice Deauxnim's debut would take place here, today, like this! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Show it! Now! Butz: OK... But steel yourselves! This... is the world of Laurice Deauxnim! Judge: ... Ah. Um... Well... So this... this is Dusky Bridge, correct? Q-Quite a large bridge, isn't it? Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Y-Yes, well... I-It's a better drawing than I expected. Butz: Isn't it? Isn't it? I struggled to reproduce those flames. I really did! Judge: ...Yes, I'm sure you did. ... von Karma: ...... Butz: ...... Edgeworth: (Nngh... This is going to get ugly... No one has the bravery to bring it up, it seems... This... mysterious flying object...) ...Larry. Butz: What? Edgeworth: The burning bridge is fine. But... What is that unfortunate looking figure...? Butz: Ah. You spotted that? I thought you might. Edgeworth: However much I might want to ignore it... I can't. Butz: It's Iris, of course! Iris! I wish she'd take better care of herself. We have to plan for our future, you know! What would've happened to her if she had injured herself flying like that...? Edgeworth: ... Larry, please. Answer this next question honestly. Butz: OK. Edgeworth: Are you REALLY claiming to have seen this? Are you claiming to have seen the silhouette of the defendant... ...flying over a bridge that was engulfed in flames...? Butz: Yep. That's what I saw. That's why I drew it! I'm an artist! A real artist! Edgeworth: Are...! von Karma: You...! Judge: High! The girl... She's really high up in this picture! Judge: Uwaaah! What was that for!? von Karma: ...This is all a bad dream. I was hitting you on the cheek to test that theory! Judge: Please whip your own cheek from now on if you wish to test your wild theories! A-Anyway! No court of law will ever acknowledge... ...that p-p-people can f-f-fly! von Karma: ...Actually, there is some precedent for this. Butz: She was flying pretty high, my sweet Iris. She was about 30 feet above the bridge, at least! It was really something to see! Judge: Th-This has to be some kind of m-m-mistake! ...Mr. Edgeworth, please bring the witness back down to earth! Edgeworth: What? Me...!? Judge: This witness is your friend, is he not? von Karma: \"Accessory to foolishness...\" ...Miles Edgeworth. Judge: Let us get back to the cross-examination! By force, if necessary! Mr. Edgeworth, I expect you to expose the obvious contradiction here! Edgeworth: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (Looks like I've got another reason to remember this moron...) Butz: ...Well, what did you think of my debut piece? Judge: Get that thing away from me! Larry's Sketch added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, hurry up and cross-examine him! Adds statement \"I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Could the reason you were so excited be...? Butz: What do you think!? My girlfriend was flying through the sky! Almost 30 feet above the bridge! I felt like I might start flying myself. Edgeworth: (If only you'd be so kind as to fly out of all of our lives...!) Butz: Anyway! I completely lost myself when I was drawing this scene! Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just where did you see this sight from!? Butz: Hey! No need to shout... When I was lying in bed in that run-down shack... The crack of the lightning bolt made me realize that the bridge was burning. I just watched it for a while from there, thinking how nicely it was burning! Then after about five minutes, I saw it. von Karma: The defendant \"flying\"...? Butz: That's right! That's when I decided to go to the bridge! Judge: ...I see. That all makes sense. Aside from the sketch itself... Edgeworth: (Yes... This sketch doesn't make any sense... I just need to convince the artist that his work is ludicrous.) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry. What did you really see that night...?\" Butz: The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The burning bridge moved you that much, did it? ...I find that hard to believe. Butz: You moron, Edgey! You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook! von Karma: An artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad! Butz: W-W-What has that got to do with anything!? Judge: I'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness. Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You transfered everything \"directly onto the page\"...? And that is this sketch here? Butz: Yep! Sensational, isn't it? Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway. von Karma: It did? Butz: That's right! The reason she didn't come to me, even though I waited for her... ...Was because she was trapped on the other side of the bridge! Judge: ... Butz: Could it be that Iris... ...undertook that dangerous, despereate flight in order to reach me...!? That's gotta be it! Alright! Go, me! Nice ooooooouch! von Karma: ...Continue. Please. Butz: ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot the passage of time to that extent, did you? Butz: Well... Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else... Edgeworth: (That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.) von Karma: Phoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts. Judge: Aside from doubts of his humanity, eh... Edgeworth: (There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!) Edgeworth: Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care. Butz: In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth! Edgeworth: If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain. Judge: What might that be...? Edgeworth: That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris! Butz: W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh! von Karma: A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim? Edgeworth: ...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct? Butz: Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah! von Karma: It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench. Edgeworth: ...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!? Butz: W-What are you talking about!? Edgeworth: ...I think you understand what I mean just fine. Butz: Why...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!? Edgeworth: What...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Butz: Edgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog! Judge: I do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage. Butz: ...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah! von Karma: ...What is it now, witness? Butz: It feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you! Edgeworth: W-What...!? Judge: What is the meaning of your outburst, witness!? Butz: ...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence. Edgeworth: \"Definitive\"...? von Karma: \"Evidence\"...? Butz: Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it! Judge: I didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality! Butz: ...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain! Edgeworth: (...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.) Witness Testimony -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Judge: A c-crystal sphere...!? Butz: This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers! von Karma: That sphere... Where did you find it? Butz: Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right. Edgeworth: And it was half-buried in the snow...? Butz: It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one! Butz: I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na√Øve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris! Iris: ... Phoenix: (Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?) To be continued. February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Edgeworth: Wright, is this what Godot was talking about? Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask‚òÜDeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: ‚ô™No motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!‚ô™ ‚ô™...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...‚ô™ Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! ‚ô™Good cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...‚ô™ Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting¬†??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down...

She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you. (I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant secret left to unlock... Pearls's Psyche-Lock...) [sic] Revenge (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...)

Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: I think it's time you told the truth about what you were doing on that night. Iris: ... Phoenix: You said you were in your room at Hazakura Temple the entire time. Do you still claim that to be the truth? Iris: Yes... That's where I was. Phoenix: Iris... I believe you're innocent. That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder! Present Bikini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Iris!? I trust you, so you need to trust me. Iris: But, Mr. Wright... I can't. Phoenix: Why not? Iris: I can't trust such random nonsense! It doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I screwed up there...) Leads back to: \"Iris... I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... But mistakes just don't suit you. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: I had hoped you would get at least this much correct. I hate seeing you mess up and getting all disappointed. Phoenix: (Nngh... I didn't know she could be so harsh...) Phoenix: Iris, what are you trying to hide...? Iris: ...! Phoenix: The more you lie about it, the more I know it's got to be something really important. Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once.

It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" There were two of you. Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?) Butz: It must've been pretty scary for you, Pearl. I know what it's like. Nick used to leave me behind when I fell asleep at school, too. Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure. I couldn't even grant my mother's final wish... Phoenix: Her \"final wish\"...? Pearl: Yes. This letter. \"This is my last wish,\" she said. \"So make sure you follow the instructions carefully.\" Phoenix: (Hmm... This letter... I definitely need to find out more about it.) Morgan's letter (appears after \"Lost powers\") Pearl: My mother has gone to a place called a \"penitentiary\". Phoenix: Yeah... I know, Pearls. Pearl: I visit her every month... And last month, she told me... Morgan: The time we've been waiting for has come, Pearl. There's something I need you to do for me. I hid a letter for you at our home before they brought me here. I want you to read it, and do exactly what it says. It's for the good of the Fey clan, my angel. You'll be doing a great thing. Now, listen carefully, and I'll tell you where the letter's hidden... Pearl: My mother is always nice to me... I love her very much! Butz: Yeah. Moms will do anything for their kids, right? Pearl: She said it was for the good of the Fey clan, so I knew I had to help her. I mean, Mystic Maya's part of the Fey clan, so it had to be good for her, too. That's right, isn't it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Usually, a picture is enough to channel someone's spirit, but this time... Butz: ...Pretty weird, huh? Phoenix: (Like Larry knows anything about this stuff!) Pearl: There's something else that was strange about my mother's letter... The seal on it was broken, as if someone had already opened it once before. Butz: ...That sure is pretty strange. Phoenix: (Someone had opened it already?) Burnt Letter updated in the Court Record. Morgan's letter (subsequent times) Pearl: My mother has gone to a place called a \"penitentiary\". Phoenix: Yeah...

I hid a letter for you at our home before they brought me here. I want you to read it, and do exactly what it says. It's for the good of the Fey clan, my angel. You'll be doing a great thing.

Phoenix: (Someone had opened it already?) Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: After dinner on the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Elise Deauxnim's room, reading a book together, correct? Pearl: Yes! I was so happy when she invited me! But... I didn't go in the end. Phoenix: You didn't go...? Pearl: ... No. There was somewhere else I had to go instead. I was so worried, I... I had to go. I didn't know what to do with myself. I was so nervous. Phoenix: (So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room... Because she was too worried about something or someone else...) ...Pearls. On the night of the murder, you went to this place, didn't you...? Present anywhere Phoenix: Phoenix: You went here, didn't you Pearls? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Looks like she's still not going to open up to me.) This is where you went because you were so worried, right? Then the next question is, \"Who or what were you so worried about?\" Now, I'm going to take a guess, and you can tell me if I'm right or wrong, OK? Pearl: Y-You mean you know!? Phoenix: If I'm right, will you tell me the whole truth? Pearl: ... O-OK... Phoenix: You went to this place for one very simple reason, and that is this: Present Maya Fey profile (after presenting Inner Temple) Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls.\" Otherwise Phoenix: Phoenix: Well Pearls? This is what you were worrying about, right? Pearl: ... There's something I'm worrying about right now, actually. Phoenix: What's that? Pearl: You, Mr. Nick. Your face has turned a really strange color. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You shouldn't work so hard, you know. You need to take a break once in a while. Phoenix: (...Being chided by a 9 year old. How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this! (I guess I'm going to have to think this through one more time from the very beginning.) Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: You knew the training Maya was undertaking was dangerous. After all, it was the Special Course. Pearl: ... Maya: I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why. The reason you were so worried about that bell was because of this: Present Burnt Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... You know, Mr. Nick, I think you should take a break now. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Even your hair's starting to look a bit tired. The spikes aren't looking so sharp. Phoenix: (Looks like picking this piece of evidence wasn't so sharp of me, either.) ...A-Anyway! You said you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell... Leads back to: \"Huh!? Oh! I...\" Phoenix: You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: I presume you recognize these pieces of paper? Pearl: Aaaaah! Wh-Where did you...? Phoenix: In the incinerator at the Inner Temple. Pearls... You were following the instructions in this letter that night, weren't you? That's why you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell. Pearl: I... I'm speechless, Mr. Nick! You're amazing! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: These instructions that were found in the incinerator... I believe they were written for you, Pearls. Pearl: For me!? I... No... Phoenix: As you can see, a large portion has been burnt... But the last section is still fairly legible. \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" Pearl: ... Phoenix: Who was it, Pearls? Whose spirit were you supposed to be channeling? Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: (Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it... ...whose spirit would Pearls have been trying to channel? Don't over-think it, Phoenix! It's pretty obvious who Pearls was supposed to channel...) The person you were trying to channel that night, Pearls, was... Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Pearls? Am I right? Pearl: I... I can't channel anyone anymore. Pearl: A spirit medium who can't channel spirits... is like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: (Poor kid. It's really getting her down.) Pearl: But... I have never channeled that person's spirit! Phoenix: (I should have all the evidence I need, so what am I not getting here...?) Leads back to: \"Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it...\" Phoenix: It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter. Pearl: Ah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (It's just as I suspected... It wasn't Iris who Sister Bikini met at the Inner Temple that night... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Do you know anything about her, Pearls? Do you know what kind of a woman Dahlia Hawthorne was? Pearl: Umm... no. I've never heard of anyone by that name before reading those instructions... Phoenix: (I thought so. Pearls doesn't have a clue. She doesn't know that Dahlia is her sister...) About the instructions in the letter I found, Pearls... Who wrote them? Pearl: Umm... Phoenix: Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of... You must have quite a lot of respect for them. Pearl: ... Phoenix: After all, you followed their instructions without question. So here's my next question. Who wrote this set of instructions for you to follow...? Present Morgan Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Pearls... I have to wonder about something...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the person who wrote the instructions, isn't it Pearls? You must have had a lot of faith in them to follow their instructions to a tee! Pearl: ... I... I had a lot of faith... in you, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Oh! Thanks! Pearl: But... ...I don't think I can trust you anymore. Phoenix: (Ouch... Pearls sure can be blunt when she wants to be... Alright now, think! Someone who Pearls would trust, no questions asked... There can't be many candidates for that post.) Leads back to: \"Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of...\" Phoenix: Pearls... I have to wonder about something... You didn't have any idea what these instructions meant, did you? Pearl: ...*ba-dump* Phoenix: But you followed them to the letter regardless. Why? Because it was your own mother who asked you. That's why. Pearl: H-How did you...? Phoenix: I figured it out. The person who wrote you this letter was your own mother, Morgan Fey! Pearl: Uh... Waaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Alright, Pearls! It's time you started telling me the truth. Pearl: M-M-Mr. N-Nick... I-I-I... Phoenix: (Why's she holding back from me? I don't like this...) Pearl: D-D-Don't underestimate m-me, j-just because I'm a ch-child! Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: If you're trying to say I followed these instructions... I'd l-like to see some proof! Phoenix: Whaaaat!? Pearl: Because... I... I d-don't think y-y-you have a-a-any! Phoenix: Nnnnnngh... (She'd say anything rather than admit to carrying out those instructions... I guess I'll have to produce some more evidence, then. One more thing should do it.) ...Alright, Pearls. We both know someone carried out these instructions on the night of the murder. But you're right. There's no evidence that proves it was you. Pearl: I-I-I knew it! Phoenix: However... I do know that whoever did it was a child. Pearl: Huh? H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: It couldn't have been an adult... No adult would've made a simple mistake like that. Pearl: A... simple mistake? What do you mean by that? Phoenix: I'm sure you thought you were carefully following the instructions you'd been given. But you misunderstood some of the words, and this is the evidence that proves it! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This shows the mistake you made! Pearl: ... Umm... I guess you know what I'm about to say, huh? I don't think it's me who made a mistake, Mr. Nick. It's you. Phoenix: (But the person who read these instructions must have been a child. That's why they misunderstood the meaning of that word... It's the only explanation for how such a simple mistake could've been made!) OK, Pearls. I'll go over it again. The person who read these instructions... Leads back to: \"It couldn't have been an adult...\" Phoenix: It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Wh-What!? Wh-Why would I d-do something like...? Phoenix: Do you remember what was written in that letter? \"Gravely roast the Master in the fires of Hades and bring our vengeance to fruition.\" But you didn't know how to read the words \"gravely\" and \"roast\" among others, right? Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea... Phoenix: Just a tiny bit. Pearl: I... I really am useless! I couldn't even burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me... (Changed from [I didn't even manage to burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me...] in the original release) Such a simple thing... And I couldn't even do it right... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful After clearing \"The night of the crime\" and \"Morgan's letter\" Talk options: Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. You really helped me out. Pearl: You're very welcome! My mother is watching over us! So I'm sure Mystic Maya will be alright! Phoenix: ... (Look at that innocent smile on her face. What am I supposed to say to her?) ???: Ha...! Godot: Finally figured it out, have you, Trite? You've finally realized how terrible of a crime being painfully oblivious is. Phoenix: G-Godot! Godot: The entrance to the Sacred Cavern looks like a freaking puzzle workshop. Phoenix: (I guess he's talking about Iris and the lock-breaking effort...) Godot: ...But it's all a waste of time. Phoenix: W-Why do you say that? Godot: Because Maya Fey isn't coming back. Phoenix: What? You don't know what you're talking about! How can you say something like that? Godot: It was your job to protect her, Trite. Just like it was your job to protect Mia Fey... Two sisters, caught up in the worst circumstances. Phoenix: I... I realize that, but... Godot: And you were the only one who was by their sides. You were the only one who could have saved them. Phoenix: But I didn't know anything about what was going on! Godot: Ha...! What did I just say, Trite? Being oblivious is a heinous crime in itself. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Tomorrow... We'll settle everything in court tomorrow. ...Once and for all. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick... Is... Is what that man just said true? Phoenix: It'll be alright, Pearls. I'm sure Maya's alive. You'll see for yourself tomorrow! Pearl: I... Yeah! That's right! I know I can trust you, Mr. Nick!

Iris: Umm... What do you mean? Phoenix: Well, if either of them had noticed you... ...they might not have continued their battle. Iris: I... I wonder if that's true... The two of them... They were standing near the garden's stone lantern. I... I was watching the whole thing from behind. It was dark where the two of them were, so... I think that's why they didn't see me. Judge: Hmm... So it was dark in the garden when the murder took place... Tell me, what did Ms. Maya Fey do after she was struck?Iris: But then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened to the victim's staff then? Iris: I-I'm not sure. The area was very dark, so... I really couldn't see. I think it got knocked away somewhere as the fight escalated. Judge: That makes sense... That would explain the need for the dagger. Iris: Mystic Elise raised the dagger to strike. But Mystic Maya dodged it at the last second. The dagger struck the lantern and fell to the ground. And then at some point, Mystic Maya picked it up...! Phoenix: (Nothing sounds especially strange yet...) Judge: What did the victim do when the weapon was stolen from her?Iris: Suddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're saying that Maya Fey turned the tables on the victim? Iris: Y-Yes... ...But Mystic Maya wasn't herself at the time. After all... Her life was in danger... Phoenix: (I still can't believe it... The idea of Maya cornering someone at knifepoint! It's just silly!) Godot: As they say... \"A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal\". Phoenix: I believe the correct description of a cornered fox is \"scared and petrified\". Godot: ... Your animal analogies have grown tiresome! Phoenix: (You were the one who started it!) Judge: Anyway... So, after Maya Fey backed the victim into the stone lantern, what happened next?Iris: That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that's what you saw!? Iris: ... Yes, I'm almost certain. Phoenix: \"Almost\"...? Iris: The garden was dark... I couldn't really tell who was who. Phoenix: (What did she just say!?) S-So in other words, it could have been someone else entirely...! Godot: Godot: We know that Maya Fey was at the Inner Temple that night. And that the woman that was killed was Elise Deauxnim. Isn't it fairly obvious who attacked who? Phoenix: Nnrgh... (I don't have anything to counter that yet...) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Please continue with your testimony. Iris: ...Yes, Your Honor. The two of them faced each other for a moment... Then Mystic Maya rushed straight into Mystic Elise! Then Mystic Elise doubled over and fell to the ground. Judge: Hmm... So she was stabbed in the stomach, huh? Iris: Yes...Present Elise's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!\"Iris: Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did that dagger go? Iris: ...I have no idea. It was dark and I couldn't see. Godot: According to the detective who found the dagger... ...it was stuck into the pine tree in the garden. Most likely it was flung towards the tree after the struggle. Judge: That is the most likely explanation, yes. Phoenix: After being stabbed in the stomach, did the victim collapse right away? Iris: ... Now that I think of it... ...she seemed to stare at Mystic Maya for a while. And Mystic Maya stood there, not moving an inch... It felt for a moment like time had just stopped. Judge: Hmm... Iris: But then, suddenly, as if the spell had worn off, Mystic Elise fell over...Phoenix: (It seems like a reasonable story at first... But... there's one thing that is completely impossible. The very idea of Maya stabbing someone... That alone is impossible! Which means... ...this faulty testimony must contain another contradiction in it somewhere.)Phoenix: ...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!Iris: Huh...?Phoenix: Until now, I didn't think you were the type to make such a careless mistake. However! The testimony you just gave contains quite a few contradictions.Iris: Wh-What do you mean? What's so wrong about my testimony?Phoenix: According to you... ...Maya Fey stabbed the victim while she had her back to the stone lantern... Correct? (Changed from [...Maya Fey stabbed the victim, who had her back to the stone lantern... Correct?] in the original release)Iris: Y-Yes... That's right.Phoenix: But in that case, the victim would've been stabbed in the stomach, right?Judge: Y-Yes, I think so...Phoenix: But! According to the autopsy report... ...the cause of death was due to blood loss from a stab wound in her back.Iris: Ah...!Phoenix: This proves that the victim was stabbed from behind, not from the front! Sister Iris! It appears another seed of doubt has sprouted from your testimony!Iris: Aaaaaaaah!Judge: What...!? What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?Godot: Ha...! It's simple. People are like books. We've all got a front and a back. You get my drift?Judge: ... Umm, is that all you have to say?Godot: I can also say that darkness loves to play with the human mind.Phoenix:Phoenix: Could you please knock it off with the cheesy proverbs and illogical metaphors already!? The point is, too much of this testimony just doesn't make sense! Throwing away a useful staff, the people fighting being mother and daughter... And now, she falsely claims the victim was stabbed in the stomach!Judge: Hmm... There certainly are some inconsistencies.Phoenix: Well, Iris... How about it!?Iris: ... W-Well, it's just...Godot: If you ask me, you're just being too na√Øve about the whole thing.Phoenix: What do you mean...?Godot: There are 253 distinct types of bitterness in coffee... But to pick out each one requires total concentration and the use of all the senses. Were you really concentrating on what this witness actually said?Judge: Prosecutor Godot! Explain yourself!Godot: The witness was quite unambigious [sic] about her own ambiguities when she said... ...that the garden was dark and she couldn't see clearly.Phoenix: ...!Godot: A human needs one thing to see clearly. And that is... light.Judge: Light...Godot: By the way, did you know? Hazakura has a rule that on nights when an acolyte is at the Inner Temple training... (Changed from [The Inner Temple has a rule that on nights when an acolyte is there training...] in the original release) ...the stone lantern in the garden must be kept lit. (Changed from [...the stone lantern in the garden is to always be lit.] in the original release)Phoenix: (Hmm... I did wonder what that stone lantern was there for...)Judge: Well if that's true... ...shouldn't the witness have been able to see the crime more clearly?Godot: ...Normally yes, Your Honor. But according to the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...on the night of the crime, it was impossible to light that stone lantern.Phoenix: Impossible...?Godot: It hadn't been used in a long time and the wick was no good. In other words... It had to be nearly pitch black in the garden that night. There could have been a faint light coming from the Training Hall, but that's all.Judge: Most enlightening...Godot: Yes, that illuminating fact has chased all the contradictions away! ...If the staff was dropped, it would be difficult to see. It also explains why they didn't recognize each other. We can't see the demons that lurk in the night... That's why humans are weak. Isn't that right, Trite?Phoenix: N-- Nooooooooooooooo!Judge: Order! Order! Ordeeer!Godot: Here, Your Honor. Let me present the stone lantern into evidence. Maybe it will rekindle the flame of truth in your mind.Stone Lantern added to the Court Record.Judge: ............Phoenix: (Why is the judge just sitting there with that look on his face...?)Godot: ...What's wrong, Your Honor?

So the judge didn't know about that yet...)Godot: Written... in blood?Iris: ...Judge: It... It says...! It says, \"Maya\" upside-down!Godot: Wh-What the...!?Iris: Oh yes... That's right... After being cornered and then stabbed by Mystic Maya... Mystic Elise didn't fall down right away. She must have been writing that on the stone lantern behind her... ...with the blood that was draining out of her body!Judge: Hmm... It certainly looks that way...Godot:Godot: Hang on... Hang on just a minute! What are you all talking about!?Judge: What do you mean, \"What are we all talking about?\"Phoenix: We're talking about the message written in blood...Godot: Hmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!Phoenix: (C-Could it be...? He can't see the bloody writing at all...!? Now that I think of it, he did say something to me yesterday...)Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.Phoenix: (So that's what he meant by that...)Judge: ...In any case, this is obviously an important clue. We now know that the crime scene was dark... ...and that the victim scrawled this message on the stone lantern! Well, Mr. Godot? Anything further?Godot: ...Judge: M-Mr. Godot?Godot: ...! Errr, umm... OK then... Let's move on.Phoenix: (Godot is literally shaking, and somehow, I don't think it's from caffeine overdose.)Judge: ...I believe it has now been established... ...that Ms. Deauxnim was killed by Maya Fey.Phoenix: (Th-That's... just wrong!)Godot: ...Now it's time to turn our attention to you.Iris: ...Yes, sir.Godot: After the victim died, you did something, didn't you?

I thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition. So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself... I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge. Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and... ...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.Judge: ...So you moved the body.Iris: Yes... I was raised at Hazakura Temple... I owe a great deal of thanks to the Fey clan. But even so... I never imagined... ...that Elise Deauxnim was actually Misty Fey! I've... I've committed a terrible sin!Judge: Hmm... A terrible trick of fate.Phoenix: (I believe you're looking for \"twist of fate\", Your Honor.)Iris: I intended to return to the Inner Temple after taking care of the body... But...Godot: You were spotted by the head nun, correct?Iris: Yes... And that's why I couldn't go back.Judge: ...Your story makes sense, I suppose. Mr. Wright, go ahead with your cross-examination.Phoenix: ...Yes, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Sister Iris's Cover-Up --Iris: After Mystic Elise died... I called out to Mystic Maya.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you waited until everything was over before making a move? Iris: N-No, it's not like that... Godot: Godot: She saw someone murdered right in front of her eyes... It's not surprising that she was a little timid... Judge: ...Yes, I suppose that's true. Sometimes when I'm watching lawyers argue back and forth with each other... ...I feel so helpless that I just sit quietly and wait for them to reach a conclusion. Phoenix: (...Isn't it your job as the judge to mediate the argument!?) Iris: It wasn't until Mystic Maya saw me... ...that it finally dawned on her what she had done.Iris: I thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So then... You knew...? You knew the significance of the name \"Maya Fey\"...? Iris: Y-Yes... Of course I did. Phoenix: (That's odd... I mean, Sister Bikini didn't recognize Maya's name, let alone her position...) Iris: Anyway... She was a very special person indeed.Iris: So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you do that? Iris: Because I didn't want Mystic Maya to be suspected in any way. I thought the best thing would be to remove the body from the crime scene... Judge: You moved her body all by yourself...? Iris: ...Yes. I did. It would have been impossible if it wasn't for the snow... Phoenix: (The snow, huh...?)Iris: I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It's pretty amazing you could make it all the way across... That's a rickety old bridge. Iris: It looks worse than it is. It's surprisingly sturdy despite its age. Godot: It's like they say, \"Idiots are too stupid to catch even a simple cold.\" Phoenix: ...But there's one other thing that bothers me. Why not just throw the body into the Eagle River? Iris: ... Phoenix: It would have been much easier than dragging it all the way to Hazakura Temple. Iris: I thought that it would still cast too much suspicion on Mystic Maya... That's why I tried to take the body as far away as possible... Godot: Ha...! Makes perfect sense to me! ...For the time being. Anyway... What did you do after you crossed the bridge?Present Weather Data (after adding statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"...You claim that the snow had already stopped when the murder occurred.\"Iris: Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The snowmobile? (I knew that would show up sooner or later...) Iris: ...Yes, I had the key. I used the snowmobile to travel from Hazakura Temple to Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: (This is the part that was in question the other day. Should I ask for more details...?) Forget it Phoenix: (...Forget it, there's plenty of other things to go after in this testimony. Iris had the key to the snowmobile. There's nothing strange about that...) Judge: Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard? Iris: Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I... Leads back to cross-examination About the snowmobile Phoenix: Let me hear more about this snowmobile ride. Iris: Well, it was very cold that night... So I rode it all the way to the foot of the bridge. Godot: Godot: I'm sorry, witness... But now, I've got a problem with your testimony. Iris: Excuse me? Phoenix: (Godot... What are you up to now?) Godot: That night... After the head nun left the remainder of the training to you... ...she said she walked from the Inner Temple back to Hazakura Temple. Judge: Yes... I'm fairly certain that's what the record indicates. Godot: Let's recall her comments on the subject... Bikini: Maybe... But, when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. Godot: ...The snowmobile was in front of the Main Gate. This is one of those contradictions, wouldn't you say? Iris: ...! Judge: Or-Order! ...Mr. Godot! Wh-Why are you pointing out contradictions in the witness's testimony!? Godot: ...Let's just say I like things to be neat and tidy, OK? Iris: Umm... Well... Maybe... S-Sister Bikini missed it. Yes, maybe she didn't see it. Phoenix: You think she missed it...? (That doesn't sound right...) Godot: Ha...! Whatever. Even I don't think this is decisive enough to warrant any more time or effort. It's just... You'd better be careful in your testimony. That's all I wanted to say. A smart little cookie like you shouldn't have any trouble understanding that. Iris: Y-Yes, sir. Phoenix: (What was that all about...? Why would Godot want to give me a hint...!?) Judge: Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard? Iris: Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I... Leads back to cross-examination About the tracks (before adding statement) Phoenix: If you really did move her body by snowmobile... ...then there should be tracks left in the snow, right? Judge: Well yes, naturally you would expect tracks. Phoenix: This picture was presented at yesterday's trial... ...Are these the tracks from that ride? Iris: Y-Yes... I think they are. Phoenix: But... I can only see one set of tracks here. Iris: ...I don't see what's so strange about that. Snow was still falling when I left Hazakura Temple. Judge: I see... Snow was still falling, huh? Iris: And then when the murder took place, it had already stopped. That's why there are such fresh-looking tracks. Judge: Hmm... How about it, Mr. Wright? What do you think about this testimony...? It's very important. Phoenix: (When the murder took place, the snow had already stopped...? That doesn't make sense if you stack it up against the other evidence.) ...Your Honor! I'd like the statement Iris just made added to the testimony! Judge: B-But... Does it have something to do with the case? Phoenix: All will be made clear if you allow her statement to be added to the record. Godot: Ha...! This should be fun! You. Let's get this snow business cleared up, shall we? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Adds statement \"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\" It's not important. Phoenix: (Nothing I've heard sounds strange at all. I'd better not get too worked up about it...) ...I'm fine, Your Honor. I have no problems with her testimony. Judge: Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard? Iris: Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I...

I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I... Leads back to cross-examinationIris: ...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is that what you were doing when Sister Bikini saw you? Iris: Y-Yes, th-that's right... She probably thought the worst... Phoenix: (\"Probably\"...? More like \"definitely\".) Judge: Hmm... I see... So Sister Bikini mistakenly thought you were the one that murdered Ms. Deauxnim... Iris: ...I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. It's my fault that this case has gotten so confusing. Judge: Hmmm...Iris: By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There have been a lot of contradictions in your testimony so far. This time... are you sure it's all true? Iris: ...Y-Yes. I am. Phoenix: When the murder happened, the snow had already stopped. According to you, that's why the snowmobile tracks were so clear... Iris: Th-That's right! I'm certain of it! Phoenix: (I think I've trapped her this time.) Godot: ... I see how you think... Snow, huh... Judge: Wh-What is going on here? Phoenix: (If the snow really had stopped by the time of the murder... ...it'd mean there's a bigger hole in her story than that movie The Grid: Revelations!) Godot: Ha...! Well then, Mr. Trite, perhaps you'd like to share your theory with us? Let's see what's up your sleeve... or rather, at the end of your index finger! Iris: ...?Phoenix: (I don't want to believe it, but I don't think my logic is failing me... ...Iris is trying to pin the murder on Maya! But why would she want to do that...? There's only one reason I can think of...)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

However, according to the Weather Data, snow stopped around 10:50 PM, and the lightning strike that burned Dusky Bridge occurred at 10:45 PM. Since the fire lasted about 30 minutes, Dusky Bridge would have been destroyed by the time the snow stopped, making it impossible for Iris to drag the body across the bridge after that point. Thus, the testimony about dragging the body across the bridge after the murder (supposedly after snow stopped) is contradicted by the weather data‚Äîshe could not have crossed at that time.\n",

February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Hey, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah? What is it? Maya: You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you? Phoenix: Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all. Maya: But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right? Phoenix: Um... I guess so, yeah. Maya: Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up! Phoenix: (Pearls...?) Pearl: So! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick! Phoenix: ...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face? Pearl: It's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special! Phoenix: ...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.) Maya: \"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true! Phoenix: I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me. Maya: It's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training! Phoenix: (Now I definitely don't want to go...) Maya: You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there! Phoenix: Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious? Pearl: Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us! Maya: Yeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"! Phoenix: Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway. Maya: Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff! Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"? Pearl: No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall! Phoenix: ... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places. Maya: Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!? Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!? Phoenix: Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!? Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun... Maya: Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick? Phoenix: (Th-This girl... I-It's...!) Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence. Dahlia: Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me! Phoenix: But... It can't be!

Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! Maya: It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my.

Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir√©e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! ‚ô™Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!‚ô™ Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask‚òÜDeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:¬†??? Time:¬†???Location:¬†??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record.

Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim.

Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge.

(Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning. (Changed from [I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Edgeworth: (Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!) Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Oh my... Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...? Edgeworth: Apparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all. Iris: ... ...... Edgeworth: This is no time to be embarrassed! Iris: I-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing. Edgeworth: Worry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him! Iris: Does that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...? Edgeworth: ...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand. Iris: Sister Bikini... Edgeworth: She claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct? Iris: ... That is correct. It wasn't me. Edgeworth: ...Very well, then. Iris: Um... Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: You are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed... Edgeworth: Don't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements. (Changed from [Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.] in the original release) Iris: I-I see... (Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people. Iris: ... Edgeworth: But right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what my friend told me once. (Changed from [That's what a friend of mine told me once.] in the original release) Iris: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I simply ask that you watch and decide for yourself... (Changed from [You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide...] in the original release) ...whether or not I am fit to do the task I have been entrusted. (Changed from [...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.] in the original release) Iris: ... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands. February 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Judge: ...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Judge: I'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant... ???: ???: The prosecution... stands ready. Judge: A-And you are...? von Karma: Franziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy. Judge: V-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma? von Karma: ... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case. Judge: Y-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: I'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once... Edgeworth: ...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor. Judge: Ms. von Karma? Do you have anything to say? von Karma: ... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office. Judge: There... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack! von Karma: ...I told you, there is no such weakling! Judge: Wh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...I have no objection to the whip. Judge: Y-You don't...? Edgeworth: The prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today! von Karma: This promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers! Edgeworth: ...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic. Judge: Allow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah! von Karma: ...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible! von Karma: The murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue. Judge: The sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: There is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime. Judge: ...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand! Edgeworth: (And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!) von Karma: ...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please. Judge: H-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight! Edgeworth: If I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release) Judge: Bailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please! von Karma: ...Once again. Your name and occupation, please. Bikini: Little old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone. Judge: ... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah! von Karma: ...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once! Judge: Y-You want me to leave!? Bikini: No need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Edgeworth: In any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question. Bikini: That's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that... Judge: Let us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh! Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Judge: Hmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple? Bikini: ...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...) von Karma: There is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple...? Bikini: Well, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right? Judge: We'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam. Bikini: ...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training. Edgeworth: And how exactly do you help with this process...? Bikini: It is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising. von Karma: Like a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies. Edgeworth: (A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place? Bikini: Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Violently...? Bikini: That's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...? Bikini: That's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off! Bikini: So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You \"left Iris to help\"... With what? Bikini: What do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper. Judge: Wasn't it your place to remain with the disciple? Bikini: Well, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away. Edgeworth: Just to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct? Bikini: Yes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions. Present Iris's Testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all. Bikini: Well, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: In that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all! Bikini: N... No...! She said that...? von Karma: von Karma: A defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi. von Karma: ...! Bikini: But that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...! Judge: Hmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah! von Karma: ...All people lie. That is my belief. Judge: Why am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question... Bikini: Dear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you? Judge: A-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I... Bikini: My memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter! Judge: Then... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence. Edgeworth: ...Understood, Your Honor. (I was na√Øve to think that alone would do the trick.) Judge: Then please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination. Changes statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\" Bikini: Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure that you're not making a mistake...? Bikini: ...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor! Edgeworth: Nngh...! Bikini: Iris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake! Judge: ...An excellent finish there, witness. Edgeworth: (Still, I have to wonder...) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\" Bikini: There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath? Bikini: My back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all. Edgeworth: How long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking? Bikini: ... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind! Edgeworth: ...? Bikini: I bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones... Edgeworth: W-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah! von Karma: ...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth. Judge: The lowest of the low. Edgeworth: (Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?) Bikini: Anyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so... Bikini: It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The crime took place in the courtyard, correct...? Bikini: When you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard. von Karma: That's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case! Judge: Hmm... That certainly seems to be true. Edgeworth: (There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.) Edgeworth: ...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct? Bikini: Of course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute... von Karma: von Karma: H-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!? Edgeworth: That's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung. von Karma: W... What!? Edgeworth: ...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release) Bikini: Well well well! Edgeworth: (It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...) Judge: Order! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa! von Karma: ...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you? Bikini: Spares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them. Judge: I see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh? Bikini: Each nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned... Judge: Hmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah! von Karma: If there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here! Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: (I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.) Judge: ...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision. Bikini: I-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this... von Karma: Sister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple! Edgeworth: (Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.) Witness Testimony -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Judge: You saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that. Edgeworth: (This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...) von Karma: I would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours? Cross Examination -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple? Bikini: Let me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge. von Karma: Still, you never made it back there that night, did you? Bikini: T-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall... Bikini: And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you heard a noise...? Bikini: \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: ...That could only be the sound of the victim falling. Bikini: It's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that. Judge: But then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground? Bikini: ... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha... Judge: Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah! von Karma: The next one to laugh gets a whipping! Bikini: Well. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and... Bikini: Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims. Bikini: Hey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to... Edgeworth: The murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can! Bikini: Hmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time! Edgeworth: ...Please, don't keep us in suspense. Bikini: Her hood! von Karma: Her hood...? Bikini: That's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right? Edgeworth: ...Urk! von Karma: Hah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: What do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important? It's not important Edgeworth: (...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them. Judge: Hmm... Judge: Very well. ...Please, continue with your testimony. von Karma: Hmph... Leads back to cross-examination It's important Edgeworth: (This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony. von Karma: Heh... Miles Edgeworth. von Karma: If you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip! Judge: Witness. Add that statement to your testimony. Bikini: ...No problem. Adds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" Bikini: Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You are sure about that...? Bikini: Yes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it! Edgeworth: ...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself. Bikini: Anyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out. von Karma: Like me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip. Edgeworth: (At least then it might bite you and not someone else...) Bikini: Iris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it! Judge: ...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh. Bikini: Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct? Judge: Which means... the victim's room was on the second floor? Bikini: No, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building. Judge: I see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct? Bikini: Yes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all... Bikini: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What makes you so sure of all this...? Bikini: It's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: You're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height. Judge: Hmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then. Bikini: Yep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (There's only two of them working there...!) von Karma: What's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark? Edgeworth: ... Present Elise's Autopsy Report Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\" Edgeworth: (...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.) Edgeworth: ...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway. Bikini: Oh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter! Edgeworth: However... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report? von Karma: T-The autopsy report...? Edgeworth: The victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed. von Karma: Ah...! Judge: T-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here! Edgeworth: The scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!? von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree? von Karma: Th-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Were there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: She was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree? Judge: W-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room. Judge: ...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah! von Karma: I'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood. Judge: When it produces the most blood...? von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: Indeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound. Judge: That's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking! von Karma: We have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions! Judge: Order! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events! Edgeworth: (I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!) von Karma: ...Hmph... Judge: It seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate! Bikini: Don't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood! von Karma: Sister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here. Edgeworth: (...With the whip?) Bikini: ...Oh, boy. Alright, alright... Witness Testimony -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. I've never seen so much blood before... That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Judge: Hmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory... von Karma: Von Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...) Cross Examination -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time... was the victim bleeding? Bikini: Well... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then. von Karma: ...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound. Edgeworth: In any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!? Bikini: Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Think carefully. This is very important. Bikini: It's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.) von Karma: The victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out? Bikini: That's right... Bikini: The whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah... Judge: It goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding. von Karma: ...Nothing out of place here. Edgeworth: (Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.) Present Shichishito Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\" Bikini: I've never seen so much blood before... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood? Bikini: T-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too... von Karma: When the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner. Edgeworth: Wh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?) Judge: Hmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me... Edgeworth: (What should I do...? Press this point further?) Stop here Edgeworth: (I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding! Leads back to cross-examination Press further Edgeworth: Going back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...? Bikini: Well, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw. Judge: W-What did you see? Bikini: Maybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day. Edgeworth: Pulling the sword out...? Bikini: Well, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\". Judge: Witness! You will add this statement to your testimony! Bikini: Oh... Was that important...!? Edgeworth: (More important than you can imagine...) Adds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...? Bikini: No mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day! Edgeworth: ...Don't you think that's a bit odd? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Why would the killer pull out the sword? von Karma: What...? Edgeworth: If all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Indeed... It is strange, now that you mention it. Edgeworth: (I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...) von Karma: A-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness? Bikini: That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Now, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct? Bikini: Well... I was unconscious... von Karma: How long were you out for? Bikini: I don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually. Judge: Hmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation! Bikini: Well, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you. Edgeworth: ...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...? Bikini: And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct? Bikini: Just stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough. Bikini: But to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...! von Karma: Truly, a heinous, despicable crime. Edgeworth: It is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily... von Karma: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem? Edgeworth: Exactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that? von Karma: ...! Judge: Hmmmmm... No, I don't think I can. von Karma: ... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts! Bikini: That's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself... Edgeworth: (\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.) Edgeworth: (There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.) Edgeworth: Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here. Bikini: W-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. von Karma: What contradictions are you talking about? Edgeworth: In the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities! Judge: What do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah! von Karma: Explain yourself! Edgeworth: To start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that. von Karma: von Karma: \"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose! Judge: The objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly. von Karma: T-That's... Edgeworth: We also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: T-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction. Judge: Y-You've still got more!? Edgeworth: ...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it? von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: If this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword! von Karma: Noooooo! Judge: Order! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa! von Karma: Bravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that! Judge: But what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but... Edgeworth: ...Having come this far, there can only be one answer. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito! Judge: W-Whaaaaaaaaat!? von Karma: A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool. Edgeworth: Let's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon? Bikini: W-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it... Edgeworth: ...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah! von Karma: So maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object. Judge: Hmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises. Judge: The obvious... question? Edgeworth: ...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: It goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found. von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Answer the question, Ms. von Karma! von Karma: ... No evidence of that kind was found. Judge: Hmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast! Bikini: Excuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually... von Karma: ...What is it, Sister? Bikini: I was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there... Judge: ... What exactly are you going on aboot here? Bikini: The murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of! Edgeworth: You what!? von Karma: Well then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister. Edgeworth: (Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?) Witness Testimony -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Judge: Hmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time. Bikini: Well. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know. von Karma: Quite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph. Judge: A snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory... von Karma: The tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge! Tracks Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: ...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon! Edgeworth: (Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...You are sure about the time? Bikini: Yes... I was worried about it, after all. Judge: Why was that? Bikini: Because I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.) von Karma: Please continue, Sister. Bikini: And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct? Bikini: Right, right, the one who trampled me. Edgeworth: (It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...) Bikini: There isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him? Edgeworth: He had forgotten it at home, apparently. von Karma: What a na√Øve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too! Bikini: Anyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell. Bikini: And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited. Bikini: That's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls! Edgeworth: Now, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived? Bikini: Yes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate. von Karma: So... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time. Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?) Press further Edgeworth: (...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time? Bikini: Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean? Judge: What do you mean, eh? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used. Bikini: Ah! I see! I never thought of that! Judge: Hmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too! von Karma: ...Of course you did. Edgeworth: Then answer the question please, witness. Bikini: ... I don't often go around touching hot engines... Edgeworth: ...Hmm. Bikini: However... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it. Judge: Snow...? Bikini: Yes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow... Edgeworth: (There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!) Judge: It seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh! von Karma: How long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Stop here Edgeworth: (It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Judge: How long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Bikini: It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking. Bikini: Ah! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain? Judge: I think that's why the question was asked in the first place... Bikini: ...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch. Judge: Hmm... Crunch. Bikini: ...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then... Bikini: Anyway, the killer must have used it! Bikini: Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Refresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...? Bikini: Like I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes. von Karma: It's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile... Edgeworth: ...I have to concede that is more than enough time. von Karma: Is that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Bikini: ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: While it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here. Judge: Oh? And what would this mystery element be? Edgeworth: The killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods? Judge: Hmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah! von Karma: Turning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor. Judge: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (She's as over the top as always...) von Karma: A-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Edgeworth: (Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...) Edgeworth: I admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder. von Karma: You've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: However... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks? von Karma: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Iris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back. Bikini: ... Ah...! You're right! von Karma: Hmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...? von Karma: On the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it! Judge: I see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow. von Karma: What do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?) It's flawless. Edgeworth: ...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow. Edgeworth: I do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim. von Karma: ...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night? Bikini: Well... that would be...! von Karma: ...You can't hide it. I already know the answer. Bikini: ......... It could only be Iris. Judge: A-And the reason being...!? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. von Karma: A key... that the defendant is responsible for! Edgeworth: Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment. Judge: What is it, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: There is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim! Judge: ... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!? Edgeworth: Nngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!) Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" There is a contradiction. Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" Edgeworth: The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible. von Karma: ... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction? Edgeworth: ...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me. Judge: On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow! Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Witness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime. Bikini: Like I said! It was around 11. Edgeworth: ...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder. Judge: The... weather report...? Edgeworth: Snow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Therefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up! von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! Judge: Very well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things! Edgeworth: ... von Karma: Answer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!? Judge: Ah, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah! von Karma: Forecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM! Judge: Hmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh! Edgeworth: W-What!? (How did she pull that off!?) Judge: \"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this. Edgeworth: (I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony. von Karma: Hah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!? Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ... Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: It looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth... Edgeworth: ...! Judge: And to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry. Edgeworth: (This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.) von Karma: Respond! Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Even if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple! Leads back to: \"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\" Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Here is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...? Judge: ... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case. Edgeworth: ... Nothing else...? Judge: Nothing else. von Karma: Oh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Nngh...! Edgeworth: (According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!) Leads back to: \"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\" Edgeworth: Ultimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed... von Karma: That's right. But proving that is... Edgeworth: Incredibly easy. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: If we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why! von Karma: Gnnngh! Edgeworth: In other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks! von Karma: Aaaaah! Judge: Order! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah! von Karma: J-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing. von Karma: Of course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release) Edgeworth: Then when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained. Judge: Hmmmmm... Bikini: Can I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me... von Karma: ...What does, Sister? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. Edgeworth: ...! von Karma: Furthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder! Bikini: ...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple... Edgeworth: (But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...) Bikini: The snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot. Judge: ...That sounds right. Bikini: But... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge. von Karma: Y-You must have just failed to see it, Sister. Bikini: Maybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too... Edgeworth: B-But that... isn't possible! Judge: Order! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean? von Karma: ...Nngh... Edgeworth: So then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple! Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...) Judge: ... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release) Bikini: Yes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know. Judge: But then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile! Edgeworth: (A witness, huh...) Judge: Was there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night? Bikini: ... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do. Judge: Hmmmm... That's a shame. Edgeworth: (Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release) Judge: R-Really!? von Karma: ...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...? Edgeworth: I don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind. Judge: Which are...? Edgeworth: First... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder. von Karma: ...And the second being? Edgeworth: This individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!? Present Larry Butz profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: Just what is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth...? Are you saying that... this is the person who was near Dusky Bridge that night? Edgeworth: I-I did think so, however... Aaah! von Karma: You're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Cool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!) Judge: Hmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual... Did they really see the snowmobile that night? Leads back to: \"I don't know for sure if he saw it or not...\" Judge: This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"... Edgeworth: This is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim. Judge: Her student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder? Edgeworth: T-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason. von Karma: And so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw? Edgeworth: I intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom. Judge: Summon this youth as a witness immediately! von Karma: ... I have no choice, do I? Edgeworth: I believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him. Judge: ...Very well. Edgeworth: (Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!) Judge: ...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness. von Karma: ...Understood, Your Honor. Judge: Good... Well then! Court is now in recess! To be continued. February 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Excuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say... Edgeworth: Iris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene. Iris: ...Alright. I'll help you any way I can. Edgeworth: First, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: ...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile? Iris: ... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me. Edgeworth: So it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge? Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: Iris... Iris: I can't... tell you about that... yet. Edgeworth: \"Yet\"...? Iris: Not until her safety is confirmed... Edgeworth: Her? Iris: The safety of the acolyte... Edgeworth: (The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life. Edgeworth: ... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough. February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: ...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...? von Karma: During the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery. Edgeworth: Suspicious behavior...? von Karma: He was sketching something... Very intensely. Judge: Dare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained? von Karma: He drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip. Judge: ... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah! von Karma: Anyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here! Edgeworth: (It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...) Butz: Ouch! von Karma: ...Your sketch is in contempt of this court! Butz: H-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch! von Karma: You tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct? Butz: L-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\". Edgeworth: ...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...? Butz: I know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it? Judge: Working in the fields...? Edgeworth: I presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope. Butz: Th-That's it! Thanks, buddy! Edgeworth: (It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...) Butz: I just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model! von Karma: ... Butz: So see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Judge: Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Stop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man! Judge: Refrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now! Butz: Waaaah... This is almost too much for me...! Witness Testimony -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... I didn't see a s-snowmobile! I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) The girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me... I'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!? Judge: Witness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony! Butz: I-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!? Judge: ... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex. Edgeworth: ...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people! Butz: Yeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy! Judge: ...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time. Cross Examination -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Judge: What ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: This one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: So, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way. Butz: OK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a \"lodge\", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right? Edgeworth: ... von Karma: See? You can do it if you try. Butz: Heh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: ...There is only one issue here. What you saw at Dusky Bridge. Butz: I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"A number of times\"...? How many? Butz: Maybe... five times? I went once every twenty minutes. Edgeworth: Which means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night? Butz: You bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands! Judge: Love, you say...? Edgeworth: It was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter. Judge: B-Blackmail...!? Butz: No, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh! von Karma: You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness! Judge: So... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh! Butz: Um... well... You see... Edgeworth: (Being called those names doesn't seem to bother him at all...) Butz: I didn't see a s-snowmobile! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Larry! You really didn't see it? Butz: H-H-Hey! No need to hit your desk! I can hear you! ...I didn't see it! I didn't see a s-s-snowmobile! Edgeworth: ... Larry. Say \"snowmobile\" for me, please? Butz: S-S-S-Snowmobile. Edgeworth: If you truly have nothing to hide... ...then why are you stammering like you just flew over a cuckoo's nest!? Butz: Sh-Shut up! W-W-What is this!? I don't know! Don't ask me! Edgeworth: (It seems that I'll need to start from a more obvious contradiction. I'm going to strike the blow that will finally get him to spill the beans!) Butz: I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You didn't meet anyone? Butz: That's right. Because I've got nothing to do with this! And I'm just here to buy some viridian paint, OK!? Come on, I expect to see those crimson lake faces! Now! Judge: ... It would appear that simply pressing him isn't going to be enough, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry Butz...\" Edgeworth: (It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...) Edgeworth: Larry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble... Butz: I'm sorry...! Edgeworth: But... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction. Butz: Edgey! Are you... trying to console me? Judge: It certainly doesn't sound that way to me. Edgeworth: However... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create! Butz: Waaah... You're totally pinning this on me... Edgeworth: ...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz! Butz: ... That's right. Me, in the flesh. Judge: Hmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change! Butz: B-But...! What do you want me to do, then!? Edgeworth: Larry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well... Judge: I'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder? Witness Testimony -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. That's when I ran into Nick. Judge: Hmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you? von Karma: So... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire? Butz: It was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall. von Karma: W-What did you say!? Edgeworth: Oh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release) von Karma: ...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release) Judge: Now, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half? Butz: Well, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess. Judge: Hmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...? Butz: I set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too. Edgeworth: ...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end. von Karma: Because they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they? Butz: Shut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her. Butz: I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This \"light\" was, of course... Butz: Lightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah! von Karma: ...Or a little like that? Butz: Waaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda! Judge: Witness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge? Butz: Well, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so... Butz: I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Seeing that, what did you do? Butz: What do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart! von Karma: And that's why you went to take a look at the bridge? Butz: Well. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind. Judge: Hmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness. Butz: There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that? Butz: Hmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\" von Karma: How far is this small shack you were in from the bridge? Butz: Hold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk? Edgeworth: And how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there? Butz: Like I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare! Edgeworth: (...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?) Not right now. Edgeworth: (I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Why didn't you call anyone? Edgeworth: ...Larry. Let me ask you one thing. Butz: What is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face? Edgeworth: Why didn't you call anyone? Butz: Huh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Normally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct? Butz: ... Well, of course I thought of doing that. Judge: So then... let's hear why you didn't! Butz: H-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" Why did you go to the bridge? Edgeworth: So you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so? Butz: W-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there. Edgeworth: If that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning. Judge: In which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness! Butz: M-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" Butz: That's when I ran into Nick. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did Phoenix Wright look when you met him? Butz: Hmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment. von Karma: How far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge? Butz: On his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say. Judge: ...And that's when the murder was reported? Butz: That's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge! Butz: I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright? Butz: Y-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway. Edgeworth: (What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!) von Karma: It was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct? Butz: Yeah. That's pretty much it. More or less. Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\" Butz: I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you decided to go and see what was happening? Butz: That's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special? Edgeworth: (Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce \"spectacle\"?) Judge: Life seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt... Butz: Well, my motto is to \"hit life back as hard as I can.\" A-Agah! von Karma: ...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip. Edgeworth: (...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.) Edgeworth: Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not... Butz: What the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien! Edgeworth: But your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time. Butz: I've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those. Edgeworth: ...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct? Butz: Yeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less. Edgeworth: ...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM. Butz: ...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act. Edgeworth: That is impossible. von Karma: ...What do you mean? Edgeworth: 11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time! von Karma: ...! Butz: Ah! Excuse me! I-I have an objection! Judge: You do? Butz: Edgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah! von Karma: ...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that! Edgeworth: ...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM! von Karma: And why not!? Edgeworth: It is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM! Judge: Which means... what, exactly? Edgeworth: Wright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!? Butz: Urk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh! von Karma: ...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem! Butz: Yeah! Not much of a problem at all! Edgeworth: Really...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident? Judge: Yes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release) Edgeworth: And therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release) von Karma: Th-That's what it sounds like... Edgeworth: Ah, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude. Edgeworth: ...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time. Butz: Listen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!? Edgeworth: Y-Yes... Butz: I may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah! von Karma: ...Then say it! Judge: Very well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!? Witness Testimony -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Judge: Hmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk... Butz: That's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch! Edgeworth: (...Including the truth, from the sound of it!) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts? Edgeworth: Not at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains. Judge: And what would that be? Edgeworth: This is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him! Butz: Hah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey! Cross Examination -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tell us, Larry... Butz: My name is Laurice! Get it right! Mistakes like that are what keep you from being popular with the ladies like I am! Judge: ... Just who exactly are you!? Butz: I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Apprentice extraordinaire! Edgeworth: That's what he calls himself, in any case. Judge: ...Then you are... an artist? Butz: Of course! I'm an artist, the real thing! Edgeworth: Yet again, that's what he calls himself. von Karma: ...Names mean nothing. There is only one issue I care to discuss. What were you doing? Edgeworth: (That is a very big issue, indeed.) Butz: Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: S-Sketching!? The burning bridge? Butz: The burning bridge and everything that came with it! Edgeworth: ... What? \"Came with it\"...? Butz: You want to hear this from my lips, do you, Edgey!? Y-You'll regret this! That sketch of mine is... Gaaah! von Karma: ...Enough. Just take that ridiculous sketch of yours out already, witness! Butz: ... W-W-W-What are you talking about? I don't know what you mean! Judge: That does indeed appear to be the fastest solution. ...I'll leave it to you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (What should I do...? I've got a terrible feeling that the instant this sketch is revealed... ...the entire world may be changed by what is depicted there...!) Leave it alone Edgeworth: ...I cannot recommend looking at the sketch. His \"works of art\" are a force of nature best measured on the Richter scale. Butz: That's right! They'll shake your heart to pieces! Judge: Hmmmm... This courtroom has yet to meet earthquake standards! I think we'd better pass! ...In which case, let us turn to other leads. Leads back to cross-examination Look at the sketch Edgeworth: ...Larry. I wonder if you could show us your sketch. Please? Butz: ... Well, well... Even I couldn't have imagined it'd turn out like this. Edgeworth: ...Imagined what? Butz: That Laurice Deauxnim's debut would take place here, today, like this! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Show it! Now! Butz: OK... But steel yourselves! This... is the world of Laurice Deauxnim! Judge: ... Ah. Um... Well... So this... this is Dusky Bridge, correct? Q-Quite a large bridge, isn't it? Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Y-Yes, well... I-It's a better drawing than I expected. Butz: Isn't it? Isn't it? I struggled to reproduce those flames. I really did! Judge: ...Yes, I'm sure you did. ... von Karma: ...... Butz: ...... Edgeworth: (Nngh... This is going to get ugly... No one has the bravery to bring it up, it seems... This... mysterious flying object...) ...Larry. Butz: What? Edgeworth: The burning bridge is fine. But... What is that unfortunate looking figure...? Butz: Ah. You spotted that? I thought you might. Edgeworth: However much I might want to ignore it... I can't. Butz: It's Iris, of course! Iris! I wish she'd take better care of herself. We have to plan for our future, you know! What would've happened to her if she had injured herself flying like that...? Edgeworth: ... Larry, please. Answer this next question honestly. Butz: OK. Edgeworth: Are you REALLY claiming to have seen this? Are you claiming to have seen the silhouette of the defendant... ...flying over a bridge that was engulfed in flames...? Butz: Yep. That's what I saw. That's why I drew it! I'm an artist! A real artist! Edgeworth: Are...! von Karma: You...! Judge: High! The girl... She's really high up in this picture! Judge: Uwaaah! What was that for!? von Karma: ...This is all a bad dream. I was hitting you on the cheek to test that theory! Judge: Please whip your own cheek from now on if you wish to test your wild theories! A-Anyway! No court of law will ever acknowledge... ...that p-p-people can f-f-fly! von Karma: ...Actually, there is some precedent for this. Butz: She was flying pretty high, my sweet Iris. She was about 30 feet above the bridge, at least! It was really something to see! Judge: Th-This has to be some kind of m-m-mistake! ...Mr. Edgeworth, please bring the witness back down to earth! Edgeworth: What? Me...!? Judge: This witness is your friend, is he not? von Karma: \"Accessory to foolishness...\" ...Miles Edgeworth. Judge: Let us get back to the cross-examination! By force, if necessary! Mr. Edgeworth, I expect you to expose the obvious contradiction here! Edgeworth: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (Looks like I've got another reason to remember this moron...) Butz: ...Well, what did you think of my debut piece? Judge: Get that thing away from me! Larry's Sketch added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, hurry up and cross-examine him! Adds statement \"I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Could the reason you were so excited be...? Butz: What do you think!? My girlfriend was flying through the sky! Almost 30 feet above the bridge! I felt like I might start flying myself. Edgeworth: (If only you'd be so kind as to fly out of all of our lives...!) Butz: Anyway! I completely lost myself when I was drawing this scene! Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just where did you see this sight from!? Butz: Hey! No need to shout... When I was lying in bed in that run-down shack... The crack of the lightning bolt made me realize that the bridge was burning. I just watched it for a while from there, thinking how nicely it was burning! Then after about five minutes, I saw it. von Karma: The defendant \"flying\"...? Butz: That's right! That's when I decided to go to the bridge! Judge: ...I see. That all makes sense. Aside from the sketch itself... Edgeworth: (Yes... This sketch doesn't make any sense... I just need to convince the artist that his work is ludicrous.) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry. What did you really see that night...?\" Butz: The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The burning bridge moved you that much, did it? ...I find that hard to believe. Butz: You moron, Edgey! You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook! von Karma: An artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad! Butz: W-W-What has that got to do with anything!? Judge: I'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness. Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You transfered everything \"directly onto the page\"...? And that is this sketch here? Butz: Yep! Sensational, isn't it? Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway. von Karma: It did? Butz: That's right! The reason she didn't come to me, even though I waited for her... ...Was because she was trapped on the other side of the bridge! Judge: ... Butz: Could it be that Iris... ...undertook that dangerous, despereate flight in order to reach me...!? That's gotta be it! Alright! Go, me! Nice ooooooouch! von Karma: ...Continue. Please. Butz: ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot the passage of time to that extent, did you? Butz: Well... Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else... Edgeworth: (That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.) von Karma: Phoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts. Judge: Aside from doubts of his humanity, eh... Edgeworth: (There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!) Edgeworth: Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care. Butz: In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth! Edgeworth: If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain. Judge: What might that be...? Edgeworth: That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris! Butz: W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh! von Karma: A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim? Edgeworth: ...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct? Butz: Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah! von Karma: It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench. Edgeworth: ...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!? Butz: W-What are you talking about!? Edgeworth: ...I think you understand what I mean just fine. Butz: Why...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!? Edgeworth: What...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Butz: Edgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog! Judge: I do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage. Butz: ...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah! von Karma: ...What is it now, witness? Butz: It feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you! Edgeworth: W-What...!? Judge: What is the meaning of your outburst, witness!? Butz: ...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence. Edgeworth: \"Definitive\"...? von Karma: \"Evidence\"...? Butz: Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it! Judge: I didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality! Butz: ...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain! Edgeworth: (...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.) Witness Testimony -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Judge: A c-crystal sphere...!? Butz: This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers! von Karma: That sphere... Where did you find it? Butz: Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right. Edgeworth: And it was half-buried in the snow...? Butz: It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one! Butz: I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na√Øve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris! Iris: ... Phoenix: (Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?) To be continued. February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Edgeworth: Wright, is this what Godot was talking about? Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask‚òÜDeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: ‚ô™No motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!‚ô™ ‚ô™...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...‚ô™ Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! ‚ô™Good cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...‚ô™ Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting¬†??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain.

It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you.

Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.)

That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder!

I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright...

Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once.

Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?)

Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure.

Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Usually, a picture is enough to channel someone's spirit, but this time... Butz: ...Pretty weird, huh? Phoenix: (Like Larry knows anything about this stuff!)

How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this!

Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah!

Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why.

Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea...

Godot: It was your job to protect her, Trite. Just like it was your job to protect Mia Fey... Two sisters, caught up in the worst circumstances. Phoenix: I... I realize that, but... Godot: And you were the only one who was by their sides. You were the only one who could have saved them. Phoenix: But I didn't know anything about what was going on! Godot: Ha...! What did I just say, Trite? Being oblivious is a heinous crime in itself. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Tomorrow... We'll settle everything in court tomorrow. ...Once and for all. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick... Is...

I wanted her to feel the same pain she made me feel! Sadly... when I realized revenge was impossible, I gave up.Godot: And the reason it was impossible...? Was it perhaps because Mia Fey had already died...?Dahlia: Yes. And I realized... there's only one way to take revenge against the dead.Judge: A-And how do you do that?Dahlia: Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever. I wanted to take away the person that Mia Fey loved most. I wanted to kill her with my own hands! That would be the one and only way I could take my revenge against Mia Fey! That was the reason I helped out with that woman's plans!Phoenix: Just for that!? For that you would kill Maya!? Your goal was no different than that of Morgan Fey!Judge: ... As they say, \"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\" What a cruel plan... Cruel, cold, and heartless.Dahlia: ...Hmph! Don't waste your time preaching to the dead. I've already told you, there's not a thing you can do to me.Phoenix: Grrrr...!Dahlia: That night... ...at about 9:30 PM, I materialized into this world. I quickly pinned my hair up and put on a demon-warding hood. Then I picked up the staff that was by my side and left Hazakura Temple.Phoenix: (So... it was Elise Deauxnim who channeled her after all.)Dahlia: ...That ridiculous head nun never noticed a thing. She left Maya Fey at the Inner Temple... ...and wobbled back clutching her poor old back.Judge: Wh-What did you do then...?Dahlia: That kid was easier to handle than I had hoped... I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and...Phoenix: S-So then you... Y-You're saying you s-stabbed Maya!Dahlia: ............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that.Judge: ...What does that mean!? No clear memory...?Dahlia: I don't know... I think... I think I was stabbed.Phoenix: You were stabbed!?Dahlia: At the last minute, Maya Fey must have stabbed me. I'm sure of it.Phoenix:Phoenix: That's not like her at all! Maya wouldn't stab a French fry with a plastic fork!Dahlia: Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. Just as I was passing out, I wrote \"Maya\" behind my back. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on her.Phoenix: (I-I can't believe she was thinking of that until the bitter end...)Dahlia: ...That's where my memory temporarily stops.Judge: It-It stops...?Dahlia: I don't have any memory of actually killing Maya Fey with my own two hands. My very last memory was... ...Maya's terror-filled eyes. When I woke up after that... ...I was in the Sacred Cavern surrounded by darkness.Judge: You were in the Sacred Cavern?Dahlia: ...The entrance was sealed with one of those trick locks. Somehow I had been trapped in there.Godot: But how did you wind up in there?Dahlia: ...I'd like to know that myself. Anyway, I was worried... I didn't know whether or not Maya Fey was dead... And I swore I wouldn't return to the underworld until I knew I had killed her myself.Godot: Hmm... For a ghost, you're one tough cookie...Dahlia: I wanted to get out of there and make sure she was dead. But... I couldn't do it. I couldn't get out.Godot: The trick lock stopped you, huh?Dahlia: I didn't know how to remove it.Judge: So then you're saying... ...you were actually confined against your will inside this Sacred Cavern...?Dahlia: Yes! I wanted to get rid of that annoying lock as soon as possible... But it wasn't easy. I kept getting interrupted while I was working on it.Phoenix: Interrupted...?Dahlia: It was early in the morning, but someone came into the Training Hall.Judge: What!? Who!?Phoenix: Could it have been... Maya!?Dahlia: I thought the same thing. But I couldn't see.Phoenix: Why not!?Dahlia: If someone had spotted me, I would have lost my chance to take revenge. ...So I made sure to hide myself well at the back of the Sacred Cavern.Phoenix: (That morning... only two people could have gone into the Training Hall. Maya and... Pearls... Pearls went there to cover the hanging scroll in gravy.)Dahlia: Still, I finally managed to remove the lock. But... I was too late.Godot: What do you mean by that?Dahlia: ...The flies had already started to gather.Godot: The bridge had been fixed and the police had started their investigation, correct?Dahlia: Naturally, I couldn't go out. So instead... I returned to the cavern and put the lock back on myself. I realized I wouldn't get a chance to see Maya's corpse as I had hoped... But just then... Lady Luck showed up.Phoenix: Lady Luck...?Dahlia: After that big earthquake... she showed up, all by herself.Phoenix: ...The real Iris?Dahlia: She said she'd come to make sure the Sacred Cavern was alright... Stupid girl. I came out from the Sacred Cavern and got a feel for the situation. ...And I locked her away in my place. I had finally learned exactly what had happened... It was then that I learned that the plan had actually succeeded.Phoenix: What do you mean your plan had succeeded?Dahlia: I had misunderstood one thing, you see. That night, the one that had summoned me... I had assumed that it was Pearl Fey.Judge: W-Well of course you would've assumed that. It was written in the instructions.Dahlia: But... I was wrong. The person that had actually called my spirit back was... Misty Fey... The picture book author...Judge: Wh... Whaaaaaaat!?Dahlia: Well, that's really the only possibility, isn't it? After I lost consciousness in the garden... ...it was her body that was left lying there... Maya Fey... I wasn't able to kill her with my own hands after all. But even so... I made her commit the most vile sin a human can commit.Judge: And that is...?Dahlia: Matricide. The sin of killing her own mother!Phoenix: Ugggh... NOOOO WAY!!Judge: Or-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of this!?Dahlia: It's true that I was the one who attacked Maya Fey... But even so... ...the murderer who actually snuffed out Misty Fey's life was none other than... ...your darling little Maya!Phoenix:Phoenix: R-Ridiculous! That's nonsense...Dahlia: Are you sure about that? ...Just think about it. There's even evidence supporting these facts, isn't there?Phoenix: What...!? What do you mean? Wh-What is this so-called evidence!?Dahlia: ...The fact that Maya Fey has disappeared is evidence enough, isn't it?Phoenix: Huh...?Dahlia: The idea that she's still in the Sacred Cavern is just ridiculous. She wasn't able to escape from the Inner Temple, that much is obvious. In that case, there is only one place she could be.Judge: Wh-Where...?Dahlia: Do I have to spell it out? ...The bottom of the Eagle River, where else?Godot: Ea-Eagle River...!?Dahlia: Maya Fey killed her long-lost mother. Can you imagine the guilt she must have felt when she realized that? That's why she threw herself into the Eagle River. Most bodies that wind up in there are lost forever. So, what do you have to say now... Feenie?Phoenix: Ooooh... Uuuuuhhhh...Phone: .........Godot: ...Oops. Sorry, that's my phone.Phoenix: (What kind of ringtone is that...?)Phone:...*beep*...Godot: ...Godot here. ......... ...OK. Thanks.Phone:...*beep*...Judge: W-Was it something important?Godot: They just finished removing the locks from the Sacred Cavern.Phoenix: That's great! What about Maya?Godot: ... There was a woman in the cave...Judge: Was it Maya Fey...?Godot: It was the accused... Sister Iris.Phoenix: Huh...?Dahlia: Don't look so surprised. ...I locked her in there yesterday. I just got finished telling you that.Phoenix: So... what about Maya? Where is she?Godot: ... There was no one else found inside the Sacred Cavern.Phoenix: N-No... It can't be...Dahlia: I told you, didn't I? She's dead.Phoenix: No... Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge: It seems... ...that this case has come to an end... A tragic end... Sadly, it appears the killer of Elise Deauxnim, also known as Misty Fey... ...was her own daughter, Maya Fey. Overcome with guilt for what she had done... ...Maya Fey jumped to her death into the raging waters of the Eagle River!Phoenix: (It can't be...)...Ha!...Godot: Trite... Have you ever heard this one? \"Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth.\" ...No matter how improbable it may seem.Judge: Wh... What is that supposed to mean, Prosecutor Godot...?Godot: According to this witness... ...Maya Fey threw herself into the Eagle River. However... is that really the truth?Phoenix: ...!Godot: Remember, this woman testified earlier that... ...the bridge was already on fire when the murder was taking place in the garden. Which means if Maya had thrown herself into the river... ...it must have been from the Inner Temple side, near the bridge.Dahlia: That's right! That's where she jumped from...Godot: But that's impossible. It's impossible to jump into the river from there!Phoenix: ...! (Wh-What...!?)Godot: Don't get your panties all twisted up, Trite. Just relax and think through the whole thing again.Phoenix: (So it's impossible...? Maya couldn't have thrown herself into Eagle River...?)Judge: ...Well, Mr. Wright? Ms. Hawthorne claims Ms. Fey threw herself into the river from the Inner Temple side. Do you have any evidence that refutes this claim?Present Hazakura Temple Map or Dusky Bridge Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's impossible to jump into the Eagle River from the Inner Temple side...\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: ...That's it? That's your answer? Godot: Ha...! The only one that should be thrown into a river is you. Phoenix: Ugh...! Godot: But then again... Even if you did... ...you wouldn't reach the river, would you? Phoenix: (Huh...? What's that...? I wouldn't reach it...?) Leads back to: \"Don't get your panties all twisted up, Trite.\"Phoenix: It's impossible to jump into the Eagle River from the Inner Temple side... No one knows that better than this witness!Dahlia: What did you say...?Phoenix: Eleven years ago, you jumped into the very same river!Dahlia: ...!Phoenix: Just take a look at this overhead map! As you can see... ...below the cliff on the Inner Temple side is a big rock shelf!Judge: Oh... Ooooh! Y-You're right!Phoenix: She wouldn't have reached the river if she had jumped off from there. In other words... If she had jumped, we should be able to see her body in this photo!Dahlia: Ah!Godot: Ha...! So you finally figured it out!Dahlia: You...! Nooooooooo!Judge: O-Order! Order!!Dahlia: You... You're just playing with me! Maya Fey's body is at the bottom of the Eagle River! There's nowhere else she could possibly be hiding!Phoenix: Ms. Hawthorne... Have you ever heard this one before? \"Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth.\"Dahlia: Yes, just a few minutes ago.Phoenix: ...Maya Fey wasn't inside the Sacred Cavern. We now know that she didn't throw herself into the Eagle River.Godot: ...Correct. That eliminates all the most likely possibilities.Phoenix: Now, although it seems improbable, there's still one other place she could be.Judge: Wh... What...!? What is this one possibility you are talking about...?Dahlia: Th-That's obviously a bluff! So where is her dead body then?Phoenix: (Finally... I think the pieces are falling into place... Normally the living have no way to punish the dead... But I think there is a way to give Dahlia Hawthorne the ultimate punishment.) ...Shall I tell you, Ms. Hawthorne? Shall I tell you where Maya is this very instant!? Maya Fey is...in the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The Inner Temple was cut off from the outside world on the night of the crime. So in other words, Maya is still there! Judge: ... Mr. Wright, let me ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds. The police scoured the Inner Temple from top to bottom, correct? Godot: You bet. Detective Gumshoe had his nose to the ground and sniffed around everywhere. Judge: Then the fact that Maya is not in the Inner Temple... ...has already been adequately proven, has it not!? Phoenix: Y-Yikes...! Guess my intuition was wrong. Godot: Intuition...? Truthiness has no place here! Use your brain, not your gut, to find the real truth, Trite! Leads back to: \"Th-That's obviously a bluff!\"in Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: It's already been proven that she isn't on the Inner Temple side! So that means... she must be somewhere in Hazakura Temple! Judge: ... Mr. Wright, let me ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds. The bridge was already on fire when the murder took place, correct? Godot: Just so you know, my heart is also on fire and it aches from your stupidity. Judge: So the impossibility of Maya Fey escaping from the Inner Temple side... ...has already been adequately proven, has it not!? Phoenix: Y-Yikes...! Guess my intuition was wrong. Godot: Intuition...? Truthiness has no place here! Use your brain, not your gut, to find the real truth, Trite! Leads back to: \"Th-That's obviously a bluff!\"in this very courtroom. Leads to: \"There's only one possibility left.\"Phoenix: There's only one possibility left. Namely... she's right here in this very courtroom!Dahlia: Wh-What!?Godot: M-Maya Fey is here!?Judge: You say she's here in m-my courtroom!?Phoenix: ...Dahlia Hawthorne. I seem to recall that you said... \"I had misunderstood one thing, you see.\"Dahlia: So what!?Phoenix: But I think there's one more thing you misunderstood.Dahlia: What do you mean...?Phoenix: Tell me something. At this very moment... ...who is channeling Dahlia Hawthorne!?Dahlia: Wh-Why that... that's obvious! It's Pearl Fey! That pathetic, little, sniveling runt!Phoenix: ...You're wrong. Pearls tried... but she couldn't do it.Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened.Phoenix: Isn't there any explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit?Pearl: ... It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit.Dahlia: Someone called me before Pearl did...? But who...?Phoenix: Pearls even tried again on the day after the crime. But she couldn't do it... What could that mean? I think the truth is becoming clearer to you right about now, am I correct?Dahlia: ... Aaaah!Phoenix: It wasn't Pearls that channeled you! There was someone who called you before she could!Present Maya Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...This is an easy one.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (No, that's not who! How can I come this far and still not get it!? Pearls couldn't channel her. And Maya had disappeared... There's only one possible answer!) Judge: Mr. Wright! You can mumble to yourself like a wino on your own time! Phoenix: P-Please... Give me just one more chance... Leads back to: \"It wasn't Pearls that channeled you!\"Phoenix: ...This is an easy one. Pearls couldn't do it, and Misty Fey is gone. There's only one possibility left!Judge: Come on already...! I can't stand the tension!Phoenix: Dahlia Hawthorne! The person channeling you right now must be... Maya Fey!Dahlia: Wh... WHAAAAAAAT!?Judge: B-But how could that be!? Remember what this witness, Dahlia Hawthorne, said about her goal!Godot: She said that her goal was to kill Maya Fey.Judge: Yes, that's right. But if Maya channeled the spirit of someone that was trying to kill her...! ...Godot: Ha...! Well, gramps? What would happen?Judge: ... C-Could it be...?Phoenix: It looks like you finally understand, Your Honor.Dahlia: W-Well, I don't! What are you going on about!?Phoenix: What I'm going on about is the reason Maya channeled you... And there's only one reason. To protect herself from you!Dahlia: To... protect herself... ...from me?Phoenix: Yes. On the night of the crime, you were only interested in one thing.Killing Maya Fey!Phoenix: The path back to Hazakura was closed off and there was nowhere for her to run. (Changed from [The path to the Inner Temple was closed off and there was nowhere for her to run.] in the original release) So then the problem became... \"Where would be the safest place to hide?\"Dahlia: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You mean... That's when she channeled me...?Phoenix: All this time, you thought you had been channeled by Pearls... (Changed from [All along you thought you had been channeled by Pearls...] in the original release) That's why it never occurred to you... ...that Maya's hiding place... ...was you!Dahlia: N-No... No... DON'T SAY THAT! Y-You're saying that I... Dahlia Hawthorne... (Changed from [Y-You're saying that I...] in the original release) ...was played for a fool!? By that little whelp!?Phoenix: ...Dahlia: Maya Fey killed herself! Isn't it obvious!?Phoenix:Phoenix: Sorry, but no... It would have been impossible for her to jump into the Eagle River. ...This was the only avenue of escape open to Maya. The only way that Maya could disappear from the Inner Temple...!Dahlia: I-I don't believe you...! A stupid little girl like that who has never been out in the real world... She could never have come up with a plan like that! Who could have ever given her such a brilliant idea!?Phoenix: ... Well......Me, of course...Phoenix: M... Mia!Dahlia: Mia Fey!Mia: It's been a long time, Dahlia Hawthorne...Godot: ... ...So it's true... It was you.Mia: ...Yes.Godot: Ha...! You're something else...Dahlia: B-But what... what are you doing here...!?Phoenix: That hair... It's Pearls, right?Mia: Tell me something, Dahlia... I want you to think back to that night one more time. You had just cornered Maya in the Inner Temple's garden. And then... in the final moments of the fight, you lost consciousness.Dahlia: I was stabbed! By Maya Fey!Mia: Actually... Maya lost consciousness at the same time as you.Godot: ...She did?Judge: Not terribly surprising since she was about to be killed.Mia: ...When she woke up, she was in the Training Hall. That's when Maya decided she needed help... So she channeled me. She explained in a memo the situation she was in. She asked me what I thought she should do.Dahlia: She did that...? I can't believe it...Mia: Of course, I didn't have all the details. But... One thing was perfectly clear.Judge: And that was...?Mia: I knew that you couldn't be allowed to wander free.Phoenix: Free...? What do you mean?Mia: It was a race against time, so I wrote down two things that Maya had to do. Channel Dahlia Hawthorne as soon as possible... ...and lock herself in the Sacred Cavern until help arrived.Phoenix: (So it was Maya who put that lock on there...)Judge: Yes, but why did you order her to do those two things?Mia: If she hadn't done it... ...Dahlia Hawthorne would've been channeled by someone else. By one Pearl Fey.Phoenix: P-Pearls?Mia: Yes. Pearl didn't properly understand the plan. So all she was trying to do was follow her mother, Morgan Fey's instructions. If she had succeeded in channeling Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit... ...things would have turned out very badly, to put it mildly.Godot: ......... ...So that's how it was. Dahlia Hawthorne would have used the body of Pearl Fey... ...to kill Maya at all costs.Judge: Y-Yes, it certainly sounds like that was the intent all along.Dahlia: H-How dare you!? I-I won't forget this...!Phoenix: Why not just admit it? ...Dahlia Hawthorne. Your little plan was nothing but a big failure.Mia: Yes... Another failure to add to the pile of shame, wouldn't you say?Dahlia: Wh-What do you mean by another!?Phoenix: Think about it, Dahlia. Remember all your past crimes? Not a single one of them was a success. They all ended in failure.Dahlia: What...!? How dare you...!Phoenix: 11 years ago... The fake kidnapping... Your very first crime. You got your hands on a 2 million dollar diamond. But... ...after Terry Fawles escaped and went to meet with Valerie Hawthorne... ...the truth was exposed.Dahlia: Sh-Shut your mouth! That wasn't my fault! It was because of that stupid oaf of a prisoner and that weakling of a policewoman!Phoenix: And then... one year later. You tried to kill me.Dahlia: ...!Phoenix: Well... I'm still alive, but... ...you wound up killing someone else. As a result, you were sentenced to death. ...It's one stupid move after another for you. But it's no longer funny.Dahlia: You...! Wipe that smug, happy-go-lucky smile off your face...!Phoenix: And now this! You've messed up again! You let Maya Fey escape. Even though she was right there in front of you!Dahlia: ...Grr...Mmm...Nnnn... Grrr... Ahh! M... M... Mia F... F... Fey Mia Fey! Mia Fey! MIA FEEEEY! You... You... spinster!! I was supposed to kill Maya Fey like I swore I would! And if only you had gotten this spiky-haired jerk the guilty verdict... ...I wouldn't have been hanged to death!Mia: ...... True.Dahlia: ...!Mia: But I think you finally understand, Dahlia Hawthorne. ...You will never defeat me.Dahlia: Wh-What...!? What did you say!?Mia: Whether you're alive, dead, or somewhere in between, you will never defeat me. As long as I'm around, you're destined to lose for all of eternity!Dahlia: Grrr... Grrrr... Grrrrr...Phoenix: ...I remember what you said earlier in the trial. You said there was no way we could punish you... ...because you were already dead.Dahlia: What about it!?Phoenix: Then you said... \"Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever.\"Mia: ...That's very true, Dahlia. And that's exactly the punishment you'll never be able to escape from.Dahlia: ...!Mia: For all of eternity, you'll have to remain as Dahlia Hawthorne. A miserable, pathetic, weak creature who can never win at anything... And for you, there is no escape from that. No hope of freedom. Since the day you were executed... ...the narrow bridge that once stretched out in front of you has burnt to a crisp!Dahlia: ...Y-You... OoOooOOh... ...Y-You'RE... wROnG... ...It... CAN'T... be... ...How... coULd... I... ...loSe... to... THe... ...likES... of... YOU...?Phoenix: It no longer matters! I don't care whether you win or lose anymore. The only thing I want... ...is for you to come out of Maya's body right now!Dahlia: ...... ...... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ...I'M... NOT... READY... ...NOT... READY... TO... GO...Maya: ...Nick... ...Sis...Judge: Now then... I assume you are the real Iris...?Iris: ...Yes. I was just rescued from the Sacred Cavern.Judge: I must say you and your twin sister are indeed identical from what I can see. In any case... It appears that everything has finally been cleared up. Mr. Godot. ...What happened to Dahlia Hawthorne?Godot: If you ask me, Your Honor... ...it looks like she went back to the hell she came from.Judge: Hmm... It seems that Misty Fey wasn't the only victim of this crime. Maya Fey, as well as the young Pearl Fey... ...were also victims of this wicked and selfish plan.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.Judge: The tragedy of \"Medium Valley\" has finally come to an end, it seems. It would be best for everyone if no further attempt was made to channel that spirit again.Phoenix: ............ Umm... Your Honor?Judge: Yes, what is it?Phoenix: About this whole \"spirit medium\" thing... It's almost weird how comfortable you seem to be with the concept now.Judge: ... Well, to be frank, my younger brother is quite judgmental... He often criticizes me for not studying hard enough. That's why I made a concerted effort to study up on the Kurain Channeling Technique.Phoenix: (Hey! Isn't that the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\"!?)Judge: ...I've seen quite a few things in my many years on the bench. And in all that time, I've finally learned this one thing. Each case is different, and takes place in its own world, if you will. In order to fully understand that world... ...first we have to immerse ourselves in it completely. And that's where... my brother and I used to differ.Phoenix: (Hmm, never thought of it that way...)Judge: ...At any rate! It's time to pass judgment in the case of Iris of Hazakura Temple.Godot:Godot: ...You're a little too fast with that gavel, Your Honor.Judge: What do you mean by that, Mr. Godot!?Mia: This trial... It isn't over yet. ...That's what he means.Phoenix: W-What!?Godot: Trite... Remember what Miss Evil Spirit said in her testimony?Phoenix: Huh? Dahlia's testimony?Dahlia: I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and...Dahlia: ............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that. I think... I think I was stabbed.Mia: ...Just as Dahlia Hawthorne was about to attack Maya... ...she was stabbed and \"killed\" by someone.Judge: Y-Yes... That's right...Godot: The person that was ultimately killed was the spirit medium that channeled Dahlia... ...Elise Deauxnim, no, Misty Fey. But... who killed her? We still don't know who did it!Phoenix: Th-This isn't over!?Godot: Unless someone else is found guilty, the accused is still on trial. We can't let her walk until there is evidence that proves her innocence.Phoenix: N-No way...Judge: But... This court isn't prepared for any further testimony...Godot: The prosecution is ready to call our final witness!Judge: F-Final... witness!?Godot: This one will clear up the whole mystery... The mystery of \"Who killed Misty Fey\"!Judge: ...Hmm, indeed!Mia: ... Is it really alright... Mr. Prosecutor?Godot: ... Of course it's alright... Madame Attorney.Judge: Very well then... Who is this final witness?Godot: Ha...! Isn't it obvious? There's one person who saw the whole event and will put the final dagger in this case.Judge: S-Someone who saw the murder take place...?Godot: ...The very person who saw her mother killed in front of her own eyes.Phoenix: Y-You... You mean Maya!? (Changed from [Y-You mean... Maya!?] in the original release) ...You can't! She can't testify after what she's just been through!Godot: We need to find the truth. The prosecution calls Maya Fey to the witness stand!Judge: ...Very well. But first, we'll take a brief recess. ...We'll have to wait for Ms. Fey to recover before summoning her. Once we receive the doctor's permission, we will proceed with the trial!Godot: ...Hey, Trite. I've got something to say to you, so listen up.Phoenix: ...What is it?Godot: I don't think much of you as a lawyer. It's always the same with you. ...You somehow manage to just squeak by without even a faint understanding of the case. Some beautiful woman always seems to come dashing in at the last minute to save you.Phoenix: Y-You've got some nerve!Godot: ...But that's not going to happen this time. This time... you're going to have to do this by yourself.Phoenix: ...!Judge: That's enough! This court is now in recess!February 10, 2:56 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Iris: I'm truly sorry about everything. You were working so hard to defend me... But I was missing all day, and we didn't even have a chance to talk...Phoenix: (...She's right. When I met \"Iris\" at the Training Hall yesterday... ...they had already switched places... and Iris was inside the Sacred Cavern.)Iris: ...I wanted to at least be in the defendant's box today to root you on.Phoenix: W-Well, it wasn't you fault. You were locked up this whole time... There's something more important than that, though. I have to ask you... Why did you help your sister out as much as you did?Iris: Huh...?Phoenix: If you had tried to get help at the Sacred Cavern yesterday... ...you wouldn't have spent an entire day locked up in there.Iris: ... My sister... I felt sorry for her. She was abandoned by our mother and never got any love from our father either.Phoenix: Yes, but... it was the same for you too, wasn't it?Iris: Yes, but at least I had Sister Bikini, who was like a mother to me. If only Dahlia had come with me to Hazakura Temple... I always... I always loved her... Dahlia was always so smart, so strong... She never complained about a thing. That's why I... That's why I promised her that I would help her.Phoenix: Are you talking about the fake kidnapping case 11 years ago?Iris: ...Yes. I-I wanted to be useful to her in some way... B-But, as usual... I was too cowardly... At the last minute, I ran away. Because of that... Dahlia's stepsister, Valerie, ended up... (Changed from [Dahlia's half-sister, Valerie, ended up...] in the original release)Phoenix: (That was the case that wounded Mia so badly...)Iris: But... things didn't end there, of course. Some people suspected that my sister was involved in the murder.Phoenix: Some people...? You must mean...Iris: Yes, two defense attorneys. (Changed from [Yes, two defense lawyers.] in the original release) Mia Fey... and Diego Armando. After poisoning Mr. Armando, who was getting too close to learning the truth... ...Dahlia even tried to kill the person who had unknowingly hid the poison for her. You.Phoenix: (...That's right...) ...Iris. There's one more thing that I have to ask you.Iris: Yes, what is it?Phoenix: On the night of the murder... ...the person that cleaned up the corpse of the victim, Elise Deauxnim... Was it... Was it really you?Iris: ... Yes... It was me. That night, after I rang the lights out bell... I went back to my room. At around 10:30, I received a call on my cell phone.Phone: ......... ...*beep*...\"There's a problem... Come to the Inner Temple right away.\"Iris: I... I got on the snowmobile and headed for the Inner Temple. But...!Phoenix: The path to the Inner Temple was cut off... Right?Iris: Exactly.Phone: ......... ...*beep*...\"We can't just leave the body here... So you've got to do this exactly as I say, got it? (Changed from [...Alright, let's do this as you said...] in the original release)\"Iris: It was me... I was the one that received her body. The murder weapon had been left in her body so she wouldn't bleed too much. The staff that Mystic Elise always held...Phoenix: I knew it... So the actual murder weapon was the staff.Iris: ...Yes, that's right. I brought the body back to Hazakura Temple on the snowmobile.Phoenix: But why... Why did you alter the body?Iris: ...I didn't want anyone to know that the staff was the murder weapon. I didn't want to leave anything that would lead back to Misty Fey... So I dressed her in a robe and stabbed her with the Shichishito... I wiped the blood off the staff's blade and left it next to her on the ground.Phoenix: ...Iris. Just tell me one last thing. Tell me the name of the person that called your cell phone. The real killer.Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... I can't do it... I can't say who did it.Phoenix: ... I... I see...Victim's Staff updated in the Court Record.Bailiff: ...Defendant!Iris: ...Y-Yes...Bailiff: The judge is calling you! He wants you to see you in his chambers. He has some questions about Dahlia Hawthorne.Iris: ...Alright. ... Well then... I'll see you later... There's something I want to tell you. (Changed from [There's something I want to tell you later.] in the original release)Phoenix: Oh, um... OK... (\"Something she wants to tell me\"? So it's true... Iris cooperated with the real killer... Maybe even from the very beginning!)Mia: ...Phoenix.Phoenix: Mia...! Umm... H-How is Maya doing!?Mia: Physically, I'm not worried. She'll recover completely. But emotionally, she's been hurt very badly by this case.Phoenix: I-I see... ...! You don't mean...! She's learned who Elise Deauxnim really was?Mia: ...Yes. I went to the medical office and talked with her. I told her everything I knew.Phoenix: ...But why?Mia: Maya is stronger than you think... I knew she could take it... All of it.Phoenix: What do you mean by that?Mia: I want you to figure that answer out by yourself. ...The trial is about to restart. The real killer... Do you know who it is yet?Phoenix: (Iris wouldn't tell me who called her. But still... I think that just maybe... I know who it was.) That night, the victim was killed in the garden of the Inner Temple. And the criminal wasn't just there by accident. Which means... ...that the killer knew of Dahlia's plan from the very beginning.Mia: ...And one more thing. The victim was moved to the Hazakura Temple side by pendulum. In other words... the criminal couldn't cross the bridge. That means they were stuck on the Inner Temple side for almost an entire day.Phoenix: (Exactly. So the culprit... (Changed from [Exactly. So the criminal...] in the original release) ...was someone that wasn't in Hazakura Temple the following day...!)Mia: ... That's as much help as I can give you. The rest of the battle is yours to win... or lose.Phoenix: OK, I've got it. ...Thank you, Mia. (Finally... It's almost time to bring this case to an end. What exactly did Maya see anyway...? And who was it that actually killed Misty Fey? Whoever it was, I have to prove it... Me. All by myself.)To be continued.February 10, 3:36 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge: Now then, before we proceed any further... ...I'm going to announce the results of the tests we had performed earlier.Phoenix: Tests...?Judge: Yes, tests. On the bloody dagger that was found stuck in the pine tree.Phoenix: Oh yeah! That! (I totally forgot about it.)Godot: That's the weapon that Maya Fey used when she fought with the victim.Phoenix: So what are the results!? Was it the victim's blood, or...?Judge: Due to time constraints, a full test wasn't possible. However... There's one thing we can say with certainty. The blood that was on this dagger was not the victim's blood! ...That is all. Now then, let's restart this trial.Phoenix: (So it wasn't Misty's blood on the dagger... Then whose was it...?)Dagger updated in the Court Record.Judge: I'm sure both the defense and the prosecution know this, but... ...this trial is rapidly coming to a close. Both sides will need to show some firm evidence with their claims.Phoenix: I understand, Your Honor.Godot: From what I've heard... ...the witness is dangerously weak, physically speaking. So, let's finish this quickly.Phoenix: ...Agreed.Judge: Very well! Please bring in the last witness!Godot: ...Witness, please tell us your name and profession.Maya: Maya Fey. My profession is... Umm... I'm the assistant manager at Wright & Co. Law Offices.Phoenix: (Maya...)Judge: According to the magazine I have here... ...you're a spirit medium of the Kurain Channeling Technique...Maya: ... I... I'm frightened. The Fey clan... I don't want any more to do with it.Phoenix: (Oh, Maya... The pain the Fey bloodline causes must be unbearable...)Judge: ...Very well. Now then, Ms. Fey. When the event occurred... you were in the garden of the Inner Temple. And... You witnessed the moment of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. ...Is this correct?Maya: ... I, umm... I... I didn't see anyth--Godot:Godot: Straighten up this instant, young lady! (Changed from [Straighten up this moment, young lady!] in the original release)Maya: Huh...?Godot: Pick your head up and speak clearly. There's always time for crying later.Maya: B-But I...Godot: Your mother was killed right in front of your eyes! There's nothing you can do to change that fact.Maya: ...!Godot: But there's something you can do... You can finish this. You've been watching the whole thing right? You've seen the witnesses come out and you've seen us squeeze the truth out of them. Now it's your turn. ...Let's hear your testimony. On the night of the crime... what exactly did you see happen!?Judge: Witness. If you please.Maya: ...Yes, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- At the Inner Temple --Maya: I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened. Suddenly, someone struck me over the head... I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern. I think I screamed, \"Help me!\" Then something warm splashed over me... That's when... I lost consciousness.Judge: Hmm... So you were struck on the head... I suppose it must have been this staff.Phoenix: Maya! The person who hit you... It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it!?Maya: I-I'm sorry, Nick. I just... I couldn't see... I don't know who it was...Phoenix: Maya, think hard...Maya: Sorry, Nick, but I really couldn't!Godot: Ha...! Can't say it was an especially good night for young ladies to be walking around alone.Judge: It seems that it will be hard to determine the criminal through testimony alone. Very well then, Mr. Wright. Please begin your cross-examination...Phoenix: ... (Maya... Hang in there... She doesn't look well at all...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- At the Inner Temple --Maya: I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who else was on the Inner Temple side that night? Maya: Well, Sister Bikini of course! But I remember her saying that Iris would be coming later as well. Phoenix: (On the day after the incident, Edgeworth met Bikini at Hazakura Temple. That means she couldn't be the criminal.) So then... did Iris actually come later like she said? Maya: Well, umm... Let me think... Phoenix: (She seems confused. It's probably because she's so tired...) Maya: No... I'm sure I didn't see her. She must have come while I was preparing for the training.Maya: Suddenly, someone struck me over the head...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who did it? Who hit you? Maya: Ah... Well... I didn't see who it was... I was hit from behind. Phoenix: You didn't see the person...? But after that, your attacker was in front of you! How could you not see who it was!? Maya: Oh! L-Let me think for a sec... I'm sorry... I just can't remember. Phoenix: (Maya is really having a hard time... What should I do?) Leave her alone Phoenix: (Considering the conditions at the crime scene... ...it's not surprising she didn't see her attacker.) Godot: Ha...! So it looks like even you've got some compassion. Leads to: \"Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely...\" Press her harder Phoenix: ...Come on, Maya, this isn't making sense. Why didn't you see this person? Maya: Umm, well, let me think... It was... Uh... Oh yeah! That's right! It was dark, that's it! Judge: It was dark...? Maya: It's not good to have too much light around when someone is undergoing spiritual training. Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, there was earlier testimony to that effect as well. So it was dark in the garden on the night of the crime... Phoenix: (Which is why she didn't see her attacker... I thought maybe she was trying to hide something, but I guess not...) Leads to: \"Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely...\" Judge: Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely... Phoenix: ...The spirit that was channeled by Elise Deauxnim... Dahlia Hawthorne! Judge: Hmm... Very well, please continue with your testimony. What happened after you were struck on the head...?Maya: I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened afterwards!? Maya: My attacker was in front of me, blocking off my escape. ...I think. Phoenix: Y-You... think...? Maya: After getting hit like that... I-I was in a state of panic. There were only two things rolling around in my mind at the time. Judge: Well now...! This is beginning to get interesting! Phoenix: So what were the two things rolling around in your mind? Maya: Umm... \"My name is Maya Fey. One plus one equals two\"... Phoenix: ... Maya: You see, for some crazy reason, I was afraid I was going to lose my memory. I know it's odd considering my life was in danger, but that's how it was... Judge: That's not odd at all. Your actions are understandable, given the circumstances. So... What did you do then?Maya: I think I screamed, \"Help me!\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You think you screamed, but you're not sure? Maya: Listen, I was a complete wreck! It was dark and I couldn't see my attacker... Was it a man? A woman? An adult? A child? I had no idea... I was scared out of my wits! Judge: Believe me, my dear... I'm certain I would have soiled my robes. Maya: I thought this person might attack me, so I... so I... Anyway, I'm pretty sure I screamed... I thought that it was my last hope. Phoenix: (Wow, it sounds like poor little Maya really was out of her mind. But I wonder what she meant by \"last hope\"... What do I do? Do I press her for more details...?) What did she scream? Phoenix: So you're certain that you screamed, \"Help me!\"? Maya: Umm... I think so. Now that I think about it... Yeah, that's gotta be what I screamed. Godot: Ha...! Is it all that strange, Trite, for her to have screamed, \"Help me\"? Phoenix: (No, but... Something about that bugs me... Why would you face someone that's trying to kill you... ...and go through the trouble of screaming for help?) Judge: ...Alright then, witness. Go on with your testimony. Maya: Oh. Um... OK. Leads back to cross-examination \"My last hope\" Phoenix: Wait a minute, Maya. What's this \"my last hope\" stuff? Maya: Um, what...? What do you mean by \"your last hope\"? Phoenix: No, no, no! That's what you said...! You said, \"my last hope.\" Maya: Huh? What? I said what? Phoenix: ...... Look, you were facing an attacker that you couldn't see and you screamed, right? You screamed, \"Help me!\" Maya: Um, yeah. Phoenix: But you testified that you screamed that because you thought it was your last hope. Maya: Oh... Well, you know... That's like... What do you call it when that happens... Phoenix: (Maya's not doing so well up there...) Maya: Oh, yeah. Umm, I... Oh! That's right! I remember now... I was facing my attacker, but that's not who I was screaming at. Phoenix: Wh-What did you just say...? Maya: Yeah, that's right... It was the person behind my attacker that I was yelling at. That's who I was screaming to for help! ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Wh-What is it now!? Maya: I messed up! I didn't... I didn't mean to let that slip out... Phoenix: Huh...? Judge: W-Witness! Are you absolutely sure of what you're saying? Behind the attacker... There was another person!? Maya: Um, I am... Well... I uhh, I meant to keep that part a secret. Nngh... What have I done? Godot: Ha...! \"It takes a ton of pressure to make a diamond.\" That's what I always say. Maya: A ton of pressure... Godot: ...You're in a court of law here! You can't make things up or try to hide things in this chamber. Judge: ...Witness. The information you just presented is vital to the case. I want you to add it to your testimony! Adds statement \"I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern.\" Wait and see Phoenix: (Maya is really emotionally and physically exhausted. I shouldn't go overboard. For the time being, I'll just play it by ear.) Judge: ...Alright then, witness. Go on with your testimony. Maya: Oh. Um... OK. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: You think you screamed, but you're not sure? Maya: Listen, I was a complete wreck!

Y-You see... I-I couldn't see. Phoenix: You couldn't see...? (She's used this excuse twice now...) Maya: Well, you know... Lantern light isn't very bright. Judge: Lantern light, did you say? Maya: There's a great big stone lantern in the garden! They always light it when an acolyte is there for training. Phoenix: ... Maya: H-Hey! You know what they say... \"Under the lantern, darkness reigns.\" So I could see the person that was further away, but not my attacker, who was closer! Plus, there weren't any other light sources in the garden at the time... Judge: Hmm...Present Stone Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"...So there was a man standing behind your attacker?\"Maya: Then something warm splashed over me...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-You don't mean...! W-Was it...? Maya: I didn't know it at the time, but... I... I think it was probably blood. Phoenix: (Is she saying that's when Ms. Deauxnim, who was channeling Dahlia... ...was stabbed in the back by the killer?) Maya: At that moment, I was paralyzed with fear... I was just sitting there in the snow. I'm sure blood got on everything around me.Maya: That's when... I lost consciousness.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So what happened next? Maya: ...I don't remember. Godot: How were you saved? You don't even remember that? Maya: No... I haven't got any idea! Umm... I really don't know what happened at all! Godot: That's too bad.Phoenix: (I've worked side by side with Maya for 3 years now. When she hides something, I can tell by how she acts. And right now... I'm absolutely certain she's hiding something!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means \"7 Branched Sword\". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare... February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Hey, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah? What is it? Maya: You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you? Phoenix: Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all. Maya: But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right? Phoenix: Um... I guess so, yeah. Maya: Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up! Phoenix: (Pearls...?) Pearl: So! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick! Phoenix: ...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face? Pearl: It's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special! Phoenix: ...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.) Maya: \"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true! Phoenix: I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me. Maya: It's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training! Phoenix: (Now I definitely don't want to go...) Maya: You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there! Phoenix: Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious? Pearl: Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us! Maya: Yeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"! Phoenix: Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway. Maya: Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff! Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"? Pearl: No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall! Phoenix: ... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places. Maya: Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!? Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!? Phoenix: Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!? Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun... Maya: Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick? Phoenix: (Th-This girl... I-It's...!) Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence. Dahlia: Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me! Phoenix: But... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...) Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... I'll go. Maya: Huh...? Phoenix: Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go. Maya: Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!? Pearl: Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!? \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls. Phoenix: (Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.) February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Brrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick! Phoenix: Maybe you should put on something warmer for a change! Maya: W-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...) Pearl: Wow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple! Maya: P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo! ???: Well, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple! Maya: Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo! ???: Oh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold. Phoenix: What's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--! ???: Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside. Maya: Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass-- ???: Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. Bikini: I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini. Maya: B-B-B-Bikini...!? Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! Maya: It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Pearl: R-Reckless...? Maya: \"Wa ha ha\"...? Pearl: Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day. Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir√©e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! ‚ô™Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!‚ô™ Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask‚òÜDeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:¬†??? Time:¬†???Location:¬†??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff.

Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record.

Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim.

Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning. (Changed from [I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Edgeworth: (Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!) Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Oh my... Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...? Edgeworth: Apparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all. Iris: ... ...... Edgeworth: This is no time to be embarrassed! Iris: I-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing. Edgeworth: Worry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him! Iris: Does that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...? Edgeworth: ...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand. Iris: Sister Bikini... Edgeworth: She claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct? Iris: ... That is correct. It wasn't me. Edgeworth: ...Very well, then. Iris: Um... Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: You are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed... Edgeworth: Don't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements. (Changed from [Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.] in the original release) Iris: I-I see... (Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people. Iris: ... Edgeworth: But right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what my friend told me once. (Changed from [That's what a friend of mine told me once.] in the original release) Iris: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I simply ask that you watch and decide for yourself... (Changed from [You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide...] in the original release) ...whether or not I am fit to do the task I have been entrusted. (Changed from [...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.] in the original release) Iris: ... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands. February 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Judge: ...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Judge: I'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant... ???: ???: The prosecution... stands ready. Judge: A-And you are...? von Karma: Franziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy. Judge: V-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma? von Karma: ... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case. Judge: Y-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: I'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once... Edgeworth: ...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor. Judge: Ms. von Karma? Do you have anything to say? von Karma: ... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office. Judge: There... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack! von Karma: ...I told you, there is no such weakling! Judge: Wh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...I have no objection to the whip. Judge: Y-You don't...? Edgeworth: The prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today! von Karma: This promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers! Edgeworth: ...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic. Judge: Allow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah! von Karma: ...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible! von Karma: The murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue. Judge: The sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: There is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime. Judge: ...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand! Edgeworth: (And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!) von Karma: ...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please. Judge: H-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight! Edgeworth: If I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release) Judge: Bailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please! von Karma: ...Once again. Your name and occupation, please. Bikini: Little old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone. Judge: ... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah! von Karma: ...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once! Judge: Y-You want me to leave!? Bikini: No need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Edgeworth: In any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question. Bikini: That's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that... Judge: Let us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh! Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Judge: Hmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple? Bikini: ...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...) von Karma: There is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple...? Bikini: Well, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right? Judge: We'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam. Bikini: ...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training. Edgeworth: And how exactly do you help with this process...? Bikini: It is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising. von Karma: Like a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies. Edgeworth: (A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place? Bikini: Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Violently...? Bikini: That's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...? Bikini: That's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off! Bikini: So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You \"left Iris to help\"... With what? Bikini: What do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper. Judge: Wasn't it your place to remain with the disciple? Bikini: Well, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away. Edgeworth: Just to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct? Bikini: Yes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions. Present Iris's Testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all. Bikini: Well, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: In that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all! Bikini: N... No...! She said that...? von Karma: von Karma: A defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi. von Karma: ...! Bikini: But that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...! Judge: Hmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah! von Karma: ...All people lie. That is my belief. Judge: Why am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question... Bikini: Dear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you? Judge: A-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I... Bikini: My memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter! Judge: Then... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence. Edgeworth: ...Understood, Your Honor. (I was na√Øve to think that alone would do the trick.) Judge: Then please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination. Changes statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\" Bikini: Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure that you're not making a mistake...? Bikini: ...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor! Edgeworth: Nngh...! Bikini: Iris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake! Judge: ...An excellent finish there, witness. Edgeworth: (Still, I have to wonder...) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\" Bikini: There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath? Bikini: My back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all. Edgeworth: How long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking? Bikini: ... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind! Edgeworth: ...? Bikini: I bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones... Edgeworth: W-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah! von Karma: ...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth. Judge: The lowest of the low. Edgeworth: (Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?) Bikini: Anyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so... Bikini: It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The crime took place in the courtyard, correct...? Bikini: When you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard. von Karma: That's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case! Judge: Hmm... That certainly seems to be true. Edgeworth: (There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.) Edgeworth: ...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct? Bikini: Of course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute... von Karma: von Karma: H-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!? Edgeworth: That's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung. von Karma: W... What!? Edgeworth: ...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release) Bikini: Well well well! Edgeworth: (It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...) Judge: Order! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa! von Karma: ...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you? Bikini: Spares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them. Judge: I see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh? Bikini: Each nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned... Judge: Hmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah! von Karma: If there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here! Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: (I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.) Judge: ...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision. Bikini: I-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this... von Karma: Sister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple! Edgeworth: (Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.) Witness Testimony -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Judge: You saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that. Edgeworth: (This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...) von Karma: I would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours? Cross Examination -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple? Bikini: Let me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge. von Karma: Still, you never made it back there that night, did you? Bikini: T-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall... Bikini: And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you heard a noise...? Bikini: \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: ...That could only be the sound of the victim falling. Bikini: It's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that. Judge: But then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground? Bikini: ... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha... Judge: Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah! von Karma: The next one to laugh gets a whipping! Bikini: Well. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and... Bikini: Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims. Bikini: Hey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to... Edgeworth: The murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can! Bikini: Hmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time! Edgeworth: ...Please, don't keep us in suspense. Bikini: Her hood! von Karma: Her hood...? Bikini: That's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right? Edgeworth: ...Urk! von Karma: Hah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: What do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important? It's not important Edgeworth: (...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them. Judge: Hmm... Judge: Very well. ...Please, continue with your testimony. von Karma: Hmph... Leads back to cross-examination It's important Edgeworth: (This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony. von Karma: Heh... Miles Edgeworth. von Karma: If you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip! Judge: Witness. Add that statement to your testimony. Bikini: ...No problem. Adds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" Bikini: Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You are sure about that...? Bikini: Yes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it! Edgeworth: ...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself. Bikini: Anyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out. von Karma: Like me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip. Edgeworth: (At least then it might bite you and not someone else...) Bikini: Iris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it! Judge: ...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh. Bikini: Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct? Judge: Which means... the victim's room was on the second floor? Bikini: No, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building. Judge: I see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct? Bikini: Yes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all... Bikini: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What makes you so sure of all this...? Bikini: It's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: You're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height. Judge: Hmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then. Bikini: Yep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (There's only two of them working there...!) von Karma: What's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark? Edgeworth: ... Present Elise's Autopsy Report Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\" Edgeworth: (...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.) Edgeworth: ...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway. Bikini: Oh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter! Edgeworth: However... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report? von Karma: T-The autopsy report...? Edgeworth: The victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed. von Karma: Ah...! Judge: T-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here! Edgeworth: The scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!? von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree? von Karma: Th-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Were there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: She was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree? Judge: W-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room. Judge: ...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah! von Karma: I'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood. Judge: When it produces the most blood...? von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: Indeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound. Judge: That's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking! von Karma: We have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions! Judge: Order! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events! Edgeworth: (I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!) von Karma: ...Hmph... Judge: It seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate! Bikini: Don't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood! von Karma: Sister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here. Edgeworth: (...With the whip?) Bikini: ...Oh, boy. Alright, alright... Witness Testimony -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. I've never seen so much blood before... That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Judge: Hmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory... von Karma: Von Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...) Cross Examination -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time... was the victim bleeding? Bikini: Well... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then. von Karma: ...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound. Edgeworth: In any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!? Bikini: Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Think carefully. This is very important. Bikini: It's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.) von Karma: The victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out? Bikini: That's right... Bikini: The whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah... Judge: It goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding. von Karma: ...Nothing out of place here. Edgeworth: (Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.) Present Shichishito Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\" Bikini: I've never seen so much blood before... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood? Bikini: T-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too... von Karma: When the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner. Edgeworth: Wh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?) Judge: Hmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me... Edgeworth: (What should I do...? Press this point further?) Stop here Edgeworth: (I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding! Leads back to cross-examination Press further Edgeworth: Going back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...? Bikini: Well, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw. Judge: W-What did you see? Bikini: Maybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day. Edgeworth: Pulling the sword out...? Bikini: Well, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\". Judge: Witness! You will add this statement to your testimony! Bikini: Oh... Was that important...!? Edgeworth: (More important than you can imagine...) Adds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...? Bikini: No mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day! Edgeworth: ...Don't you think that's a bit odd? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Why would the killer pull out the sword? von Karma: What...? Edgeworth: If all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Indeed... It is strange, now that you mention it. Edgeworth: (I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...) von Karma: A-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness? Bikini: That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Now, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct? Bikini: Well... I was unconscious... von Karma: How long were you out for? Bikini: I don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually. Judge: Hmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation! Bikini: Well, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you. Edgeworth: ...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...? Bikini: And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct? Bikini: Just stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough. Bikini: But to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...! von Karma: Truly, a heinous, despicable crime. Edgeworth: It is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily... von Karma: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem? Edgeworth: Exactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that? von Karma: ...! Judge: Hmmmmm... No, I don't think I can. von Karma: ... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts! Bikini: That's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself... Edgeworth: (\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.) Edgeworth: (There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.) Edgeworth: Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here. Bikini: W-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. von Karma: What contradictions are you talking about? Edgeworth: In the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities! Judge: What do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah! von Karma: Explain yourself! Edgeworth: To start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that. von Karma: von Karma: \"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose! Judge: The objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly. von Karma: T-That's... Edgeworth: We also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: T-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction. Judge: Y-You've still got more!? Edgeworth: ...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it? von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: If this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword! von Karma: Noooooo! Judge: Order! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa! von Karma: Bravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that! Judge: But what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but... Edgeworth: ...Having come this far, there can only be one answer. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito! Judge: W-Whaaaaaaaaat!? von Karma: A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool. Edgeworth: Let's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon? Bikini: W-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it... Edgeworth: ...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah! von Karma: So maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object. Judge: Hmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises. Judge: The obvious... question? Edgeworth: ...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: It goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found. von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Answer the question, Ms. von Karma! von Karma: ... No evidence of that kind was found. Judge: Hmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast! Bikini: Excuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually... von Karma: ...What is it, Sister? Bikini: I was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there... Judge: ... What exactly are you going on aboot here? Bikini: The murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of! Edgeworth: You what!? von Karma: Well then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister. Edgeworth: (Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?) Witness Testimony -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Judge: Hmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time. Bikini: Well. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know. von Karma: Quite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph. Judge: A snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory... von Karma: The tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge! Tracks Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: ...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon! Edgeworth: (Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...You are sure about the time? Bikini: Yes... I was worried about it, after all. Judge: Why was that? Bikini: Because I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.) von Karma: Please continue, Sister. Bikini: And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct? Bikini: Right, right, the one who trampled me. Edgeworth: (It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...) Bikini: There isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him? Edgeworth: He had forgotten it at home, apparently. von Karma: What a na√Øve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too! Bikini: Anyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell. Bikini: And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited. Bikini: That's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls! Edgeworth: Now, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived? Bikini: Yes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate. von Karma: So... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time. Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?) Press further Edgeworth: (...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time? Bikini: Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean? Judge: What do you mean, eh? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used. Bikini: Ah! I see! I never thought of that! Judge: Hmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too! von Karma: ...Of course you did. Edgeworth: Then answer the question please, witness. Bikini: ... I don't often go around touching hot engines... Edgeworth: ...Hmm. Bikini: However... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it. Judge: Snow...? Bikini: Yes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow... Edgeworth: (There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!) Judge: It seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh! von Karma: How long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Stop here Edgeworth: (It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Judge: How long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Bikini: It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking. Bikini: Ah! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain? Judge: I think that's why the question was asked in the first place... Bikini: ...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch. Judge: Hmm... Crunch. Bikini: ...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then... Bikini: Anyway, the killer must have used it! Bikini: Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Refresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...? Bikini: Like I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes. von Karma: It's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile... Edgeworth: ...I have to concede that is more than enough time. von Karma: Is that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Bikini: ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: While it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here. Judge: Oh? And what would this mystery element be? Edgeworth: The killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods? Judge: Hmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah! von Karma: Turning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor. Judge: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (She's as over the top as always...) von Karma: A-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Edgeworth: (Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...) Edgeworth: I admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder. von Karma: You've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: However... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks? von Karma: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Iris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back. Bikini: ... Ah...! You're right! von Karma: Hmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...? von Karma: On the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it! Judge: I see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow. von Karma: What do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?) It's flawless. Edgeworth: ...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow. Edgeworth: I do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim. von Karma: ...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night? Bikini: Well... that would be...! von Karma: ...You can't hide it. I already know the answer. Bikini: ......... It could only be Iris. Judge: A-And the reason being...!? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. von Karma: A key... that the defendant is responsible for! Edgeworth: Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment. Judge: What is it, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: There is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim! Judge: ... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!? Edgeworth: Nngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!) Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" There is a contradiction. Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" Edgeworth: The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible. von Karma: ... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction? Edgeworth: ...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me. Judge: On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow! Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Witness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime. Bikini: Like I said! It was around 11. Edgeworth: ...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder. Judge: The... weather report...? Edgeworth: Snow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Therefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up! von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! Judge: Very well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things! Edgeworth: ... von Karma: Answer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!? Judge: Ah, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah! von Karma: Forecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM! Judge: Hmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh! Edgeworth: W-What!? (How did she pull that off!?) Judge: \"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this. Edgeworth: (I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony. von Karma: Hah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!? Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ... Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: It looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth... Edgeworth: ...! Judge: And to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry. Edgeworth: (This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.) von Karma: Respond! Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Even if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple! Leads back to: \"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\" Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Here is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...? Judge: ... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case. Edgeworth: ... Nothing else...? Judge: Nothing else. von Karma: Oh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Nngh...! Edgeworth: (According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!) Leads back to: \"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\" Edgeworth: Ultimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed... von Karma: That's right. But proving that is... Edgeworth: Incredibly easy. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: If we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why! von Karma: Gnnngh! Edgeworth: In other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks! von Karma: Aaaaah! Judge: Order! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah! von Karma: J-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing. von Karma: Of course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release) Edgeworth: Then when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained. Judge: Hmmmmm... Bikini: Can I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me... von Karma: ...What does, Sister? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. Edgeworth: ...! von Karma: Furthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder! Bikini: ...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple... Edgeworth: (But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...) Bikini: The snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot. Judge: ...That sounds right. Bikini: But... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge. von Karma: Y-You must have just failed to see it, Sister. Bikini: Maybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too... Edgeworth: B-But that... isn't possible! Judge: Order! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean? von Karma: ...Nngh... Edgeworth: So then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple! Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...) Judge: ... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release) Bikini: Yes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know. Judge: But then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile! Edgeworth: (A witness, huh...) Judge: Was there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night? Bikini: ... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do. Judge: Hmmmm... That's a shame. Edgeworth: (Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release) Judge: R-Really!? von Karma: ...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...? Edgeworth: I don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind. Judge: Which are...? Edgeworth: First... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder. von Karma: ...And the second being? Edgeworth: This individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!? Present Larry Butz profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: Just what is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth...? Are you saying that... this is the person who was near Dusky Bridge that night? Edgeworth: I-I did think so, however... Aaah! von Karma: You're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Cool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!) Judge: Hmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual... Did they really see the snowmobile that night? Leads back to: \"I don't know for sure if he saw it or not...\" Judge: This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"... Edgeworth: This is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim. Judge: Her student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder? Edgeworth: T-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason. von Karma: And so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw? Edgeworth: I intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom. Judge: Summon this youth as a witness immediately! von Karma: ... I have no choice, do I? Edgeworth: I believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him. Judge: ...Very well. Edgeworth: (Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!) Judge: ...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness. von Karma: ...Understood, Your Honor. Judge: Good... Well then! Court is now in recess! To be continued. February 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Excuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say... Edgeworth: Iris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene. Iris: ...Alright. I'll help you any way I can. Edgeworth: First, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: ...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile? Iris: ... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me. Edgeworth: So it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge? Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: Iris... Iris: I can't... tell you about that... yet. Edgeworth: \"Yet\"...? Iris: Not until her safety is confirmed... Edgeworth: Her? Iris: The safety of the acolyte... Edgeworth: (The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life. Edgeworth: ... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough. February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: ...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...? von Karma: During the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery. Edgeworth: Suspicious behavior...? von Karma: He was sketching something... Very intensely. Judge: Dare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained? von Karma: He drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip. Judge: ... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah! von Karma: Anyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here! Edgeworth: (It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...) Butz: Ouch! von Karma: ...Your sketch is in contempt of this court! Butz: H-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch! von Karma: You tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct? Butz: L-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\". Edgeworth: ...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...? Butz: I know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it? Judge: Working in the fields...? Edgeworth: I presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope. Butz: Th-That's it! Thanks, buddy! Edgeworth: (It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...) Butz: I just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model! von Karma: ... Butz: So see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Judge: Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Stop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man! Judge: Refrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now! Butz: Waaaah... This is almost too much for me...! Witness Testimony -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... I didn't see a s-snowmobile! I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) The girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me... I'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!? Judge: Witness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony! Butz: I-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!? Judge: ... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex. Edgeworth: ...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people! Butz: Yeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy! Judge: ...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time. Cross Examination -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Judge: What ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: This one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: So, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way. Butz: OK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a \"lodge\", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right? Edgeworth: ... von Karma: See? You can do it if you try. Butz: Heh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: ...There is only one issue here. What you saw at Dusky Bridge. Butz: I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"A number of times\"...? How many? Butz: Maybe... five times? I went once every twenty minutes. Edgeworth: Which means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night? Butz: You bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands! Judge: Love, you say...? Edgeworth: It was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter. Judge: B-Blackmail...!? Butz: No, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh! von Karma: You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness! Judge: So... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh! Butz: Um... well... You see... Edgeworth: (Being called those names doesn't seem to bother him at all...) Butz: I didn't see a s-snowmobile! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Larry! You really didn't see it? Butz: H-H-Hey! No need to hit your desk! I can hear you! ...I didn't see it! I didn't see a s-s-snowmobile! Edgeworth: ... Larry. Say \"snowmobile\" for me, please? Butz: S-S-S-Snowmobile. Edgeworth: If you truly have nothing to hide... ...then why are you stammering like you just flew over a cuckoo's nest!? Butz: Sh-Shut up! W-W-What is this!? I don't know! Don't ask me! Edgeworth: (It seems that I'll need to start from a more obvious contradiction. I'm going to strike the blow that will finally get him to spill the beans!) Butz: I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You didn't meet anyone? Butz: That's right. Because I've got nothing to do with this! And I'm just here to buy some viridian paint, OK!? Come on, I expect to see those crimson lake faces! Now! Judge: ... It would appear that simply pressing him isn't going to be enough, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry Butz...\" Edgeworth: (It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...) Edgeworth: Larry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble... Butz: I'm sorry...! Edgeworth: But... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction. Butz: Edgey! Are you... trying to console me? Judge: It certainly doesn't sound that way to me. Edgeworth: However... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create! Butz: Waaah... You're totally pinning this on me... Edgeworth: ...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz! Butz: ... That's right. Me, in the flesh. Judge: Hmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change! Butz: B-But...! What do you want me to do, then!? Edgeworth: Larry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well... Judge: I'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder? Witness Testimony -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. That's when I ran into Nick. Judge: Hmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you? von Karma: So... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire? Butz: It was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall. von Karma: W-What did you say!? Edgeworth: Oh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release) von Karma: ...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release) Judge: Now, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half? Butz: Well, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess. Judge: Hmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...? Butz: I set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too. Edgeworth: ...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end. von Karma: Because they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they? Butz: Shut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her. Butz: I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This \"light\" was, of course... Butz: Lightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah! von Karma: ...Or a little like that? Butz: Waaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda! Judge: Witness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge? Butz: Well, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so... Butz: I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Seeing that, what did you do? Butz: What do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart! von Karma: And that's why you went to take a look at the bridge? Butz: Well. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind. Judge: Hmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness. Butz: There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that? Butz: Hmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\" von Karma: How far is this small shack you were in from the bridge? Butz: Hold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk? Edgeworth: And how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there? Butz: Like I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare! Edgeworth: (...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?) Not right now. Edgeworth: (I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Why didn't you call anyone? Edgeworth: ...Larry. Let me ask you one thing. Butz: What is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face? Edgeworth: Why didn't you call anyone? Butz: Huh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Normally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct? Butz: ... Well, of course I thought of doing that. Judge: So then... let's hear why you didn't! Butz: H-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" Why did you go to the bridge? Edgeworth: So you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so? Butz: W-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there. Edgeworth: If that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning. Judge: In which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness! Butz: M-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" Butz: That's when I ran into Nick. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did Phoenix Wright look when you met him? Butz: Hmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment. von Karma: How far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge? Butz: On his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say. Judge: ...And that's when the murder was reported? Butz: That's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge! Butz: I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright? Butz: Y-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway. Edgeworth: (What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!) von Karma: It was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct? Butz: Yeah. That's pretty much it. More or less. Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\" Butz: I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you decided to go and see what was happening? Butz: That's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special? Edgeworth: (Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce \"spectacle\"?) Judge: Life seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt... Butz: Well, my motto is to \"hit life back as hard as I can.\" A-Agah! von Karma: ...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip. Edgeworth: (...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.) Edgeworth: Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not... Butz: What the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien! Edgeworth: But your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time. Butz: I've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those. Edgeworth: ...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct? Butz: Yeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less. Edgeworth: ...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM. Butz: ...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act. Edgeworth: That is impossible. von Karma: ...What do you mean? Edgeworth: 11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time! von Karma: ...! Butz: Ah! Excuse me! I-I have an objection! Judge: You do? Butz: Edgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah! von Karma: ...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that! Edgeworth: ...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM! von Karma: And why not!? Edgeworth: It is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM! Judge: Which means... what, exactly? Edgeworth: Wright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!? Butz: Urk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh! von Karma: ...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem! Butz: Yeah! Not much of a problem at all! Edgeworth: Really...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident? Judge: Yes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release) Edgeworth: And therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release) von Karma: Th-That's what it sounds like... Edgeworth: Ah, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude. Edgeworth: ...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time. Butz: Listen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!? Edgeworth: Y-Yes... Butz: I may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah! von Karma: ...Then say it! Judge: Very well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!? Witness Testimony -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Judge: Hmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk... Butz: That's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch! Edgeworth: (...Including the truth, from the sound of it!) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts? Edgeworth: Not at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains. Judge: And what would that be? Edgeworth: This is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him! Butz: Hah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey! Cross Examination -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tell us, Larry... Butz: My name is Laurice! Get it right! Mistakes like that are what keep you from being popular with the ladies like I am! Judge: ... Just who exactly are you!? Butz: I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Apprentice extraordinaire! Edgeworth: That's what he calls himself, in any case. Judge: ...Then you are... an artist? Butz: Of course! I'm an artist, the real thing! Edgeworth: Yet again, that's what he calls himself. von Karma: ...Names mean nothing. There is only one issue I care to discuss. What were you doing? Edgeworth: (That is a very big issue, indeed.) Butz: Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: S-Sketching!? The burning bridge? Butz: The burning bridge and everything that came with it! Edgeworth: ... What? \"Came with it\"...? Butz: You want to hear this from my lips, do you, Edgey!? Y-You'll regret this! That sketch of mine is... Gaaah! von Karma: ...Enough. Just take that ridiculous sketch of yours out already, witness! Butz: ... W-W-W-What are you talking about? I don't know what you mean! Judge: That does indeed appear to be the fastest solution. ...I'll leave it to you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (What should I do...? I've got a terrible feeling that the instant this sketch is revealed... ...the entire world may be changed by what is depicted there...!) Leave it alone Edgeworth: ...I cannot recommend looking at the sketch. His \"works of art\" are a force of nature best measured on the Richter scale. Butz: That's right! They'll shake your heart to pieces! Judge: Hmmmm... This courtroom has yet to meet earthquake standards! I think we'd better pass! ...In which case, let us turn to other leads. Leads back to cross-examination Look at the sketch Edgeworth: ...Larry. I wonder if you could show us your sketch. Please? Butz: ... Well, well... Even I couldn't have imagined it'd turn out like this. Edgeworth: ...Imagined what? Butz: That Laurice Deauxnim's debut would take place here, today, like this! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Show it! Now! Butz: OK... But steel yourselves! This... is the world of Laurice Deauxnim! Judge: ... Ah. Um... Well... So this... this is Dusky Bridge, correct? Q-Quite a large bridge, isn't it? Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Y-Yes, well... I-It's a better drawing than I expected. Butz: Isn't it? Isn't it? I struggled to reproduce those flames. I really did! Judge: ...Yes, I'm sure you did. ... von Karma: ...... Butz: ...... Edgeworth: (Nngh... This is going to get ugly... No one has the bravery to bring it up, it seems... This... mysterious flying object...) ...Larry. Butz: What? Edgeworth: The burning bridge is fine. But... What is that unfortunate looking figure...? Butz: Ah. You spotted that? I thought you might. Edgeworth: However much I might want to ignore it... I can't. Butz: It's Iris, of course! Iris! I wish she'd take better care of herself. We have to plan for our future, you know! What would've happened to her if she had injured herself flying like that...? Edgeworth: ... Larry, please. Answer this next question honestly. Butz: OK. Edgeworth: Are you REALLY claiming to have seen this? Are you claiming to have seen the silhouette of the defendant... ...flying over a bridge that was engulfed in flames...? Butz: Yep. That's what I saw. That's why I drew it! I'm an artist! A real artist! Edgeworth: Are...! von Karma: You...! Judge: High! The girl... She's really high up in this picture! Judge: Uwaaah! What was that for!? von Karma: ...This is all a bad dream. I was hitting you on the cheek to test that theory! Judge: Please whip your own cheek from now on if you wish to test your wild theories! A-Anyway! No court of law will ever acknowledge... ...that p-p-people can f-f-fly! von Karma: ...Actually, there is some precedent for this. Butz: She was flying pretty high, my sweet Iris. She was about 30 feet above the bridge, at least! It was really something to see! Judge: Th-This has to be some kind of m-m-mistake! ...Mr. Edgeworth, please bring the witness back down to earth! Edgeworth: What? Me...!? Judge: This witness is your friend, is he not? von Karma: \"Accessory to foolishness...\" ...Miles Edgeworth. Judge: Let us get back to the cross-examination! By force, if necessary! Mr. Edgeworth, I expect you to expose the obvious contradiction here! Edgeworth: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (Looks like I've got another reason to remember this moron...) Butz: ...Well, what did you think of my debut piece? Judge: Get that thing away from me! Larry's Sketch added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, hurry up and cross-examine him! Adds statement \"I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Could the reason you were so excited be...? Butz: What do you think!? My girlfriend was flying through the sky! Almost 30 feet above the bridge! I felt like I might start flying myself. Edgeworth: (If only you'd be so kind as to fly out of all of our lives...!) Butz: Anyway! I completely lost myself when I was drawing this scene! Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just where did you see this sight from!? Butz: Hey! No need to shout... When I was lying in bed in that run-down shack... The crack of the lightning bolt made me realize that the bridge was burning. I just watched it for a while from there, thinking how nicely it was burning! Then after about five minutes, I saw it. von Karma: The defendant \"flying\"...? Butz: That's right! That's when I decided to go to the bridge! Judge: ...I see. That all makes sense. Aside from the sketch itself... Edgeworth: (Yes... This sketch doesn't make any sense... I just need to convince the artist that his work is ludicrous.) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry. What did you really see that night...?\" Butz: The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The burning bridge moved you that much, did it? ...I find that hard to believe. Butz: You moron, Edgey! You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook! von Karma: An artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad! Butz: W-W-What has that got to do with anything!? Judge: I'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness. Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You transfered everything \"directly onto the page\"...? And that is this sketch here? Butz: Yep! Sensational, isn't it? Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway. von Karma: It did? Butz: That's right! The reason she didn't come to me, even though I waited for her... ...Was because she was trapped on the other side of the bridge! Judge: ... Butz: Could it be that Iris... ...undertook that dangerous, despereate flight in order to reach me...!? That's gotta be it! Alright! Go, me! Nice ooooooouch! von Karma: ...Continue. Please. Butz: ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot the passage of time to that extent, did you? Butz: Well... Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else... Edgeworth: (That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.) von Karma: Phoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts. Judge: Aside from doubts of his humanity, eh... Edgeworth: (There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!) Edgeworth: Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care. Butz: In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth! Edgeworth: If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain. Judge: What might that be...? Edgeworth: That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris! Butz: W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh! von Karma: A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim? Edgeworth: ...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct? Butz: Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah! von Karma: It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench. Edgeworth: ...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!? Butz: W-What are you talking about!? Edgeworth: ...I think you understand what I mean just fine. Butz: Why...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!? Edgeworth: What...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Butz: Edgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog! Judge: I do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage. Butz: ...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah! von Karma: ...What is it now, witness? Butz: It feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you! Edgeworth: W-What...!? Judge: What is the meaning of your outburst, witness!? Butz: ...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence. Edgeworth: \"Definitive\"...? von Karma: \"Evidence\"...? Butz: Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it! Judge: I didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality! Butz: ...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain! Edgeworth: (...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.) Witness Testimony -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Judge: A c-crystal sphere...!? Butz: This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers! von Karma: That sphere... Where did you find it? Butz: Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right. Edgeworth: And it was half-buried in the snow...? Butz: It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one! Butz: I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na√Øve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris! Iris: ... Phoenix: (Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?) To be continued. February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Edgeworth: Wright, is this what Godot was talking about? Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask‚òÜDeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: ‚ô™No motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!‚ô™ ‚ô™...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...‚ô™ Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! ‚ô™Good cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...‚ô™ Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting¬†??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month.

She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you. (I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant secret left to unlock... Pearls's Psyche-Lock...) [sic] Revenge (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...)

Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: I think it's time you told the truth about what you were doing on that night. Iris: ... Phoenix: You said you were in your room at Hazakura Temple the entire time. Do you still claim that to be the truth? Iris: Yes... That's where I was. Phoenix: Iris... I believe you're innocent. That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder! Present Bikini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Iris!? I trust you, so you need to trust me. Iris: But, Mr. Wright... I can't. Phoenix: Why not? Iris: I can't trust such random nonsense! It doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I screwed up there...) Leads back to: \"Iris... I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... But mistakes just don't suit you. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: I had hoped you would get at least this much correct. I hate seeing you mess up and getting all disappointed. Phoenix: (Nngh... I didn't know she could be so harsh...) Phoenix: Iris, what are you trying to hide...? Iris: ...! Phoenix: The more you lie about it, the more I know it's got to be something really important. Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with?

Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" There were two of you. Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence!

Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

They really did make a fire, right in front of the shack...) Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Butz: Hah! You're too late, Nick! If you came here for one of our potatoes, we've already polished them all off! Phoenix: (I think I've pretty much got all the evidence I need. Now I just need to find out what Pearls is hiding.) Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: I... After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?) Butz: It must've been pretty scary for you, Pearl. I know what it's like. Nick used to leave me behind when I fell asleep at school, too. Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure. I couldn't even grant my mother's final wish... Phoenix: Her \"final wish\"...? Pearl: Yes. This letter. \"This is my last wish,\" she said. \"So make sure you follow the instructions carefully.\" Phoenix: (Hmm... This letter... I definitely need to find out more about it.) Morgan's letter (appears after \"Lost powers\") Pearl: My mother has gone to a place called a \"penitentiary\". Phoenix: Yeah... I know, Pearls. Pearl: I visit her every month... And last month, she told me... Morgan: The time we've been waiting for has come, Pearl. There's something I need you to do for me. I hid a letter for you at our home before they brought me here. I want you to read it, and do exactly what it says. It's for the good of the Fey clan, my angel. You'll be doing a great thing. Now, listen carefully, and I'll tell you where the letter's hidden... Pearl: My mother is always nice to me... I love her very much! Butz: Yeah. Moms will do anything for their kids, right? Pearl: She said it was for the good of the Fey clan, so I knew I had to help her. I mean, Mystic Maya's part of the Fey clan, so it had to be good for her, too. That's right, isn't it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Usually, a picture is enough to channel someone's spirit, but this time... Butz: ...Pretty weird, huh? Phoenix: (Like Larry knows anything about this stuff!) Pearl: There's something else that was strange about my mother's letter... The seal on it was broken, as if someone had already opened it once before. Butz: ...That sure is pretty strange. Phoenix: (Someone had opened it already?) Burnt Letter updated in the Court Record. Morgan's letter (subsequent times) Pearl: My mother has gone to a place called a \"penitentiary\". Phoenix: Yeah...

Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: After dinner on the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Elise Deauxnim's room, reading a book together, correct? Pearl: Yes! I was so happy when she invited me! But... I didn't go in the end. Phoenix: You didn't go...? Pearl: ... No. There was somewhere else I had to go instead. I was so worried, I... I had to go. I didn't know what to do with myself. I was so nervous. Phoenix: (So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room... Because she was too worried about something or someone else...) ...Pearls. On the night of the murder, you went to this place, didn't you...? Present anywhere Phoenix: Phoenix: You went here, didn't you Pearls? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Looks like she's still not going to open up to me.) This is where you went because you were so worried, right? Then the next question is, \"Who or what were you so worried about?\" Now, I'm going to take a guess, and you can tell me if I'm right or wrong, OK? Pearl: Y-You mean you know!? Phoenix: If I'm right, will you tell me the whole truth? Pearl: ... O-OK... Phoenix: You went to this place for one very simple reason, and that is this: Present Maya Fey profile (after presenting Inner Temple) Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls.\" Otherwise Phoenix: Phoenix: Well Pearls? This is what you were worrying about, right? Pearl: ... There's something I'm worrying about right now, actually. Phoenix: What's that? Pearl: You, Mr. Nick. Your face has turned a really strange color. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You shouldn't work so hard, you know. You need to take a break once in a while. Phoenix: (...Being chided by a 9 year old. How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this! (I guess I'm going to have to think this through one more time from the very beginning.) Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: You knew the training Maya was undertaking was dangerous. After all, it was the Special Course. Pearl: ... Maya: I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why. The reason you were so worried about that bell was because of this: Present Burnt Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... You know, Mr. Nick, I think you should take a break now. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Even your hair's starting to look a bit tired. The spikes aren't looking so sharp. Phoenix: (Looks like picking this piece of evidence wasn't so sharp of me, either.) ...A-Anyway! You said you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell... Leads back to: \"Huh!? Oh! I...\" Phoenix: You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: I presume you recognize these pieces of paper? Pearl: Aaaaah! Wh-Where did you...? Phoenix: In the incinerator at the Inner Temple. Pearls... You were following the instructions in this letter that night, weren't you? That's why you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell. Pearl: I... I'm speechless, Mr. Nick! You're amazing! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: These instructions that were found in the incinerator... I believe they were written for you, Pearls. Pearl: For me!? I... No... Phoenix: As you can see, a large portion has been burnt... But the last section is still fairly legible. \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" Pearl: ... Phoenix: Who was it, Pearls? Whose spirit were you supposed to be channeling? Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: (Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it... ...whose spirit would Pearls have been trying to channel? Don't over-think it, Phoenix! It's pretty obvious who Pearls was supposed to channel...) The person you were trying to channel that night, Pearls, was... Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Pearls? Am I right? Pearl: I... I can't channel anyone anymore. Pearl: A spirit medium who can't channel spirits... is like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: (Poor kid. It's really getting her down.) Pearl: But... I have never channeled that person's spirit! Phoenix: (I should have all the evidence I need, so what am I not getting here...?) Leads back to: \"Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it...\" Phoenix: It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter. Pearl: Ah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (It's just as I suspected... It wasn't Iris who Sister Bikini met at the Inner Temple that night... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Do you know anything about her, Pearls? Do you know what kind of a woman Dahlia Hawthorne was? Pearl: Umm... no. I've never heard of anyone by that name before reading those instructions... Phoenix: (I thought so. Pearls doesn't have a clue. She doesn't know that Dahlia is her sister...) About the instructions in the letter I found, Pearls... Who wrote them? Pearl: Umm... Phoenix: Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of... You must have quite a lot of respect for them. Pearl: ... Phoenix: After all, you followed their instructions without question. So here's my next question. Who wrote this set of instructions for you to follow...? Present Morgan Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Pearls... I have to wonder about something...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the person who wrote the instructions, isn't it Pearls? You must have had a lot of faith in them to follow their instructions to a tee! Pearl: ... I... I had a lot of faith... in you, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Oh! Thanks! Pearl: But... ...I don't think I can trust you anymore. Phoenix: (Ouch... Pearls sure can be blunt when she wants to be... Alright now, think! Someone who Pearls would trust, no questions asked... There can't be many candidates for that post.) Leads back to: \"Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of...\" Phoenix: Pearls... I have to wonder about something... You didn't have any idea what these instructions meant, did you? Pearl: ...*ba-dump* Phoenix: But you followed them to the letter regardless. Why? Because it was your own mother who asked you. That's why. Pearl: H-How did you...? Phoenix: I figured it out. The person who wrote you this letter was your own mother, Morgan Fey! Pearl: Uh... Waaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Alright, Pearls! It's time you started telling me the truth. Pearl: M-M-Mr. N-Nick... I-I-I... Phoenix: (Why's she holding back from me? I don't like this...) Pearl: D-D-Don't underestimate m-me, j-just because I'm a ch-child! Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: If you're trying to say I followed these instructions... I'd l-like to see some proof! Phoenix: Whaaaat!? Pearl: Because... I... I d-don't think y-y-you have a-a-any! Phoenix: Nnnnnngh... (She'd say anything rather than admit to carrying out those instructions... I guess I'll have to produce some more evidence, then. One more thing should do it.) ...Alright, Pearls. We both know someone carried out these instructions on the night of the murder. But you're right. There's no evidence that proves it was you. Pearl: I-I-I knew it! Phoenix: However... I do know that whoever did it was a child. Pearl: Huh? H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: It couldn't have been an adult... No adult would've made a simple mistake like that. Pearl: A... simple mistake? What do you mean by that? Phoenix: I'm sure you thought you were carefully following the instructions you'd been given. But you misunderstood some of the words, and this is the evidence that proves it! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This shows the mistake you made! Pearl: ... Umm... I guess you know what I'm about to say, huh? I don't think it's me who made a mistake, Mr. Nick. It's you. Phoenix: (But the person who read these instructions must have been a child. That's why they misunderstood the meaning of that word... It's the only explanation for how such a simple mistake could've been made!) OK, Pearls. I'll go over it again. The person who read these instructions... Leads back to: \"It couldn't have been an adult...\" Phoenix: It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Wh-What!? Wh-Why would I d-do something like...? Phoenix: Do you remember what was written in that letter? \"Gravely roast the Master in the fires of Hades and bring our vengeance to fruition.\" But you didn't know how to read the words \"gravely\" and \"roast\" among others, right? Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea... Phoenix: Just a tiny bit. Pearl: I... I really am useless! I couldn't even burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me...

That means she couldn't be the criminal.) So then... did Iris actually come later like she said? Maya: Well, umm... Let me think... Phoenix: (She seems confused. It's probably because she's so tired...) Maya: No... I'm sure I didn't see her.

L-Let me think for a sec... I'm sorry... I just can't remember. Phoenix: (Maya is really having a hard time... What should I do?)

Maya: It's not good to have too much light around when someone is undergoing spiritual training. Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, there was earlier testimony to that effect as well. So it was dark in the garden on the night of the crime... Phoenix: (Which is why she didn't see her attacker... I thought maybe she was trying to hide something, but I guess not...)

Y-You see... I-I couldn't see. Phoenix: You couldn't see...? (She's used this excuse twice now...) Maya: Well, you know... Lantern light isn't very bright. Judge: Lantern light, did you say? Maya: There's a great big stone lantern in the garden! They always light it when an acolyte is there for training. Phoenix: ... Maya: H-Hey! You know what they say... \"Under the lantern, darkness reigns.\" So I could see the person that was further away, but not my attacker, who was closer! Plus, there weren't any other light sources in the garden at the time... Judge: Hmm...Present Stone Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"...So there was a man standing behind your attacker?\"Maya: Then something warm splashed over me...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-You don't mean...! W-Was it...? Maya: I didn't know it at the time, but... I... I think it was probably blood. Phoenix: (Is she saying that's when Ms. Deauxnim, who was channeling Dahlia... ...was stabbed in the back by the killer?) Maya: At that moment, I was paralyzed with fear... I was just sitting there in the snow. I'm sure blood got on everything around me.Maya: That's when... I lost consciousness.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So what happened next? Maya: ...I don't remember. Godot: How were you saved? You don't even remember that? Maya: No... I haven't got any idea! Umm... I really don't know what happened at all! Godot: That's too bad.Phoenix: (I've worked side by side with Maya for 3 years now. When she hides something, I can tell by how she acts. And right now... I'm absolutely certain she's hiding something!)Phoenix: ...So there was a man standing behind your attacker?Maya: Umm... yeah.Phoenix: That man... He's the killer. He stabbed her from behind. He's the one who killed Elise Deauxnim... Otherwise known as... Misty Fey, your mother.Maya: The killer...!Phoenix: Maya... You know who killed your mother, don't you.Maya: Umm...Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: To be frank, Your Honor, I think she is in shock and quite confused. That's why she hasn't noticed the huge problem with her testimony.Maya: H-Huh? What do you mean? What problem...?Phoenix: ...Maya. On the night of the crime... that stone lantern was out of commission.Maya: Huh... What!?Phoenix: ...It's true. There was no light anywhere in the garden that night.Maya: N-No!Judge: Order! Order in the court! M-Mr. Godot! Explain this!Godot: ...Add the pureness of milk to the perfect, clear darkness of coffee. Stir. That is the state of the witness's mind right now -- a cup of caf√© au lait.Judge: C-Caf√© o' Lay? Is that even legal...?Godot: Mr. Trite's words are the milk and you are the spoon, Your Honor.Judge: I-I'm a spoon!? I'm no spoony bard, I'll have you know!Godot: You must have noticed it too, Trite. ...This witness's mental state is highly unstable right now. It's not hard to understand why she would make a little mistake like that.Phoenix:Phoenix: Sorry, but that's not going to cut it!Godot: ...What did you say!?Phoenix: If there truly was no light in the garden... ...then there's a fatal contradiction in the witness's last bit of testimony!Maya: N-Nick...Phoenix: ...May I? Recall the witness's statement about her attacker. She said that she didn't know if it was a man or a woman, an adult or a child. ...And yet! The witness could describe a person that was standing behind her attacker... And she quite clearly described him as a man!Maya: Ah...!Phoenix: ...In other words! That would have to mean that Maya actually saw our mystery person! Despite it being so dark that she couldn't see the face of her own attacker! (Changed from [Despite it being so dark that she couldn't see the face of the attacker in front of her!] in the original release)Maya: N... NOOOOOOOOOO!Judge: Or-Order! Order! Order! What in the world does this all mean, Mr. Wright!? Are you saying Ms. Fey saw the real killer under pitch black conditions!?Godot:Godot: Trite! Do you have any idea what you're proposing? How could she have seen in the dark? There was no other light source at the scene!Phoenix:Phoenix: There are some things that you can only see in the dark, Mr. Godot.Godot: ...!Phoenix: Maya, you did see who the killer was in the dark. And now... you're trying to cover for him.Judge: C-Cover...!? For the man that killed her mother...!?Phoenix: There's only one conclusion I can draw from this... You know who this man is!Maya: ...... ... Please... Nick... I don't know anything... Please... I'm begging you...Godot: ...Ha! You talk a good game, Trite. But let's see if you can walk the walk. It was pitch black. So what could the witness see? I'm calling your bluff!Maya: N-No, Nick! Don't...! P-Please! Stop...!Phoenix: (Maya is dead set on protecting this guy... The man who murdered Maya's long-lost mother...! But... I can't let him get away with it. I'm a lawyer. An officer of the court. I'm here to find the truth!)Judge: ...Alright, Mr. Wright. Time to show us what you've got. Who was this person that you say Ms. Fey saw in the darkness...?Present Godot profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Because it was pitch black, Ms. Fey was able to recognize the killer easily.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: It looks like you've proven a well-known fact. The fact that people really CAN'T see in the dark! Phoenix: Urk... Godot: You're just the man I thought you were... You should try a nice, sweet caf√© au lait at least once in your life, Trite! Phoenix: ...... (B-But I'm sure she saw the killer in the dark...! So the answer is clear! What is visible in the dark!?) Leads back to: \"...Alright, Mr. Wright. Time to show us what you've got.\"Phoenix: Because it was pitch black, Ms. Fey was able to recognize the killer easily. I'm sure the court would like to see for itself how this is possible, yes?Judge: What!? B-But how do you propose to show us something like that!?Phoenix: ...It's easy. We just need to recreate the conditions of that night.Judge: C-Conditions...?Phoenix: Your Honor! The defense officially requests... ...that all the lights in this courtroom be turned off!Judge: ... Wh... Wh... This is... ...But it can't be...!Godot:...Ha...That was a nice bit of deduction... Trite.Phoenix: Well, everyone...? This is the man Maya saw on the night of the murder!Judge: Order! Order! Order! Prosecutor Godot! What is the meaning of this!?Godot: ...Judge: Surely you must be shocked to hear yourself accused of such a thing! Why aren't you denying it!?Godot: Ha...! Your Honor. You're asking the wrong person.Judge: Wh-What do you mean by that!?Godot: If you've got a question, ask the witness... That's one of my rules.Phoenix: Well, Maya!? How about it? What you saw that night... Was it 3 glowing red lights?Maya: ...Judge: Well, witness? Answer the question.Maya: ... Y... You're wrong! I-I... I never saw that!Phoenix: M-Maya!Maya: I thought the person that stabbed my mother was a man... ...for a totally different reason!Phoenix: Wha-Whaat?Judge: W-Witness... M-Mr. Wright, what the...!?Godot:Godot: Stop your chattering, Your Honor.Judge: Ch-Ch-Chattering...?Godot: If it's worth asking, ask the witness. That's one of my rules.Judge: ...... Alright. Well then, let's continue with the testimony. Please tell us how you knew the killer was a man!Maya: ...Y-Yes, Your Honor. I didn't realize it until after I woke up, but...Witness Testimony-- The Killer --Maya: ...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor. By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed... The torches were lit... And the body was gone. And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too. Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...Judge: Hmm... So it was after the crime took place that the witness came to think the killer was a man.Maya: Yes... That's right...I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...Judge: No need to apologize. It's as Mr. Godot said... You're utterly exhausted. It's only natural that you would be a little confused.Godot: ...Judge: Also, if you consider the situation you described... ...it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to assume the criminal was a man. Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Killer --Maya: ...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you lost consciousness when you were in the garden. Is that right? Maya: Yes. I think... I think it happened when the v-victim was stabbed. Phoenix: So then the person that carried you into the Inner Temple...? Judge: It could only have been the killer...! Godot: ... Maya: That's what I think, too. Phoenix: (So the killer carried Maya into the Inner Temple...)Maya: By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... ...... I don't know. Phoenix: (It looks like she doesn't have enough confidence. I think I need to gather some more information before I ask her again...)Press (after pressing third and fourth statements) Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something. Phoenix: You did? Maya: Yes... I felt like the killer was hiding the evidence for me... for my sake... Judge: Wh-What? Hiding it for you...!? Maya: Everyone knew that I was the only one at the Inner Temple that night. If Sister Bikini had come back and looked at the garden... Phoenix: ...She may have thought that you had done it... Judge: ...No, she definitely would have thought so. And you're saying that's why the killer... ...cleaned up the crime scene to make it look like nothing had happened...? Maya: Yes. I'm sure of it. Judge: Well, that's certainly an important piece of information! I want you to add that to your testimony! Maya: Yes, Your Honor... Adds statement \"I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.\"Press (after pressing third and fourth statements; subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something. Phoenix: You did?Maya: I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: They did it for your sake...? Maya: Well... If the body and the blood hadn't been removed... ...I would've immediately been the prime suspect, right? Judge: Yes, I suppose that's true. Phoenix: (Yeah, and if that happened, the body would have caused some other problems, too. If her real identity had come out right then, it would have been terrible. \"Master of Kurain Killed by Own Daughter!\" I don't think Maya would've been able to handle it...) Judge: But still... It's rather difficult to fathom the killer's motives. What reason is there to go through that much trouble to protect you...? Maya: ...Present Stone Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard.\"Maya: The torches were lit... And the body was gone.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The torches were lit? Maya: Yes. That's how I noticed that the whole scene had changed. Phoenix: (I'm going to say it was the killer who lit the torches... I mean, who else could it be?) Judge: The killer probably lit them since it'd be impossible to do any cover-up work in the dark. However, if that's true, there's one thing that still bothers me. Why did the killer go to the effort of moving the body? Phoenix: (That's true... It's hard to see how that would be of any advantage to the killer. The only one who would gain anything from that would be... ...the only person that was at the Inner Temple, Maya.) Maya: ... Judge: Very well... Let me hear some more about the condition of the crime scene.Maya: And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're saying the killer cleaned up the snow? (It did look really odd... The snow was removed in an unnatural-looking rectangular shape around the lantern...) Maya: There were a lot of shovels around the Inner Temple. But they're all really heavy. Way too heavy for me to use. Judge: ...An odd fellow indeed, this killer. Why on earth would anyone want to take snow away? Phoenix: Well there's one thing I can think of... Didn't you say that a lot of the victim's blood sprayed onto the snow? Maya: Y-Yeah... The area I collapsed in ended up being splattered. Phoenix: In other words... ...the killer's purpose was to hide the bloody snow. I think that's the most reasonable explanation. Judge: Hmm, perhaps... However, there's something that's bothering me. If the killer just wanted to hide the snow with blood on it... ...there was no need to remove that amount. Phoenix: (That's true... He could have scooped up just the snow that was stained with blood.) Judge: It looks like there are some mysteries behind this issue. Maya: ...But, I think this will help explain them!Maya: Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you're saying that you never saw the killer, right? Maya: Y-Yes. Phoenix: But earlier you very clearly stated that... ...you saw a man behind your attacker. Maya: ... Nick... I'm sorry...Phoenix: (The killer certainly went through a lot of trouble... Moving the body by pendulum, manipulating the crime scene... But for what purpose...? Why do all that? Maybe Maya knows more than she's letting on...)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

You are a spirit medium, after all. Maya: But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right? Phoenix: Um... I guess so, yeah. Maya: Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up! Phoenix: (Pearls...?) Pearl: So! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick! Phoenix: ...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face? Pearl: It's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special! Phoenix: ...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.) Maya: \"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true! Phoenix: I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me. Maya: It's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training! Phoenix: (Now I definitely don't want to go...) Maya: You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there! Phoenix: Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious? Pearl: Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us! Maya: Yeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"! Phoenix: Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway. Maya: Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff! Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?

Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! Maya: It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my.

Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir√©e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! ‚ô™Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!‚ô™ Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask‚òÜDeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:¬†??? Time:¬†???Location:¬†??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record. Ami Fey statue (subsequent times) Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir.

Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim.

That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge.

(Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning. (Changed from [I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued.

Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Edgeworth: (Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!) Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Oh my... Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...? Edgeworth: Apparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all. Iris: ... ...... Edgeworth: This is no time to be embarrassed! Iris: I-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing. Edgeworth: Worry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him! Iris: Does that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...? Edgeworth: ...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand. Iris: Sister Bikini... Edgeworth: She claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct? Iris: ... That is correct. It wasn't me. Edgeworth: ...Very well, then. Iris: Um... Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: You are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed... Edgeworth: Don't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements. (Changed from [Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.] in the original release) Iris: I-I see... (Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people. Iris: ... Edgeworth: But right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what my friend told me once. (Changed from [That's what a friend of mine told me once.] in the original release) Iris: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I simply ask that you watch and decide for yourself... (Changed from [You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide...] in the original release) ...whether or not I am fit to do the task I have been entrusted. (Changed from [...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.] in the original release) Iris: ... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands. February 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Judge: ...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Judge: I'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant... ???: ???: The prosecution... stands ready. Judge: A-And you are...? von Karma: Franziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy. Judge: V-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma? von Karma: ... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case. Judge: Y-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: I'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once... Edgeworth: ...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor. Judge: Ms. von Karma? Do you have anything to say? von Karma: ... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office. Judge: There... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack! von Karma: ...I told you, there is no such weakling! Judge: Wh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...I have no objection to the whip. Judge: Y-You don't...? Edgeworth: The prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today! von Karma: This promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers! Edgeworth: ...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic. Judge: Allow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah! von Karma: ...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible! von Karma: The murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue. Judge: The sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: There is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime. Judge: ...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand! Edgeworth: (And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!) von Karma: ...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please. Judge: H-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight! Edgeworth: If I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release) Judge: Bailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please! von Karma: ...Once again. Your name and occupation, please. Bikini: Little old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone. Judge: ... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah! von Karma: ...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once! Judge: Y-You want me to leave!? Bikini: No need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Edgeworth: In any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question. Bikini: That's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that... Judge: Let us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh! Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Judge: Hmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple? Bikini: ...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...) von Karma: There is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Night of the Murder -- Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple...? Bikini: Well, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right? Judge: We'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam. Bikini: ...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training. Edgeworth: And how exactly do you help with this process...? Bikini: It is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising. von Karma: Like a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies. Edgeworth: (A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place? Bikini: Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Violently...? Bikini: That's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...? Bikini: That's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off! Bikini: So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You \"left Iris to help\"... With what? Bikini: What do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper. Judge: Wasn't it your place to remain with the disciple? Bikini: Well, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away. Edgeworth: Just to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct? Bikini: Yes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions. Present Iris's Testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all. Bikini: Well, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: In that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all! Bikini: N... No...! She said that...? von Karma: von Karma: A defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi. von Karma: ...! Bikini: But that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...! Judge: Hmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah! von Karma: ...All people lie. That is my belief. Judge: Why am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question... Bikini: Dear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you? Judge: A-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I... Bikini: My memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter! Judge: Then... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence. Edgeworth: ...Understood, Your Honor. (I was na√Øve to think that alone would do the trick.) Judge: Then please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination. Changes statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\" Bikini: Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure that you're not making a mistake...? Bikini: ...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor! Edgeworth: Nngh...! Bikini: Iris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake! Judge: ...An excellent finish there, witness. Edgeworth: (Still, I have to wonder...) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\" Bikini: There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath? Bikini: My back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all. Edgeworth: How long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking? Bikini: ... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind! Edgeworth: ...? Bikini: I bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones... Edgeworth: W-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah! von Karma: ...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth. Judge: The lowest of the low. Edgeworth: (Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?) Bikini: Anyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so... Bikini: It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The crime took place in the courtyard, correct...? Bikini: When you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard. von Karma: That's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case! Judge: Hmm... That certainly seems to be true. Edgeworth: (There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.) Edgeworth: ...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct? Bikini: Of course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute... von Karma: von Karma: H-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!? Edgeworth: That's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung. von Karma: W... What!? Edgeworth: ...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release) Bikini: Well well well! Edgeworth: (It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...) Judge: Order! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa! von Karma: ...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you? Bikini: Spares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them. Judge: I see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh? Bikini: Each nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned... Judge: Hmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah! von Karma: If there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here! Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: (I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.) Judge: ...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision. Bikini: I-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this... von Karma: Sister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple! Edgeworth: (Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.) Witness Testimony -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Judge: You saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that. Edgeworth: (This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...) von Karma: I would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours? Cross Examination -- After My Bath -- Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple? Bikini: Let me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge. von Karma: Still, you never made it back there that night, did you? Bikini: T-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall... Bikini: And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you heard a noise...? Bikini: \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: ...That could only be the sound of the victim falling. Bikini: It's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that. Judge: But then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground? Bikini: ... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha... Judge: Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah! von Karma: The next one to laugh gets a whipping! Bikini: Well. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and... Bikini: Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims. Bikini: Hey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to... Edgeworth: The murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can! Bikini: Hmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time! Edgeworth: ...Please, don't keep us in suspense. Bikini: Her hood! von Karma: Her hood...? Bikini: That's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right? Edgeworth: ...Urk! von Karma: Hah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: What do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important? It's not important Edgeworth: (...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them. Judge: Hmm... Judge: Very well. ...Please, continue with your testimony. von Karma: Hmph... Leads back to cross-examination It's important Edgeworth: (This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony. von Karma: Heh... Miles Edgeworth. von Karma: If you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip! Judge: Witness. Add that statement to your testimony. Bikini: ...No problem. Adds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" Bikini: Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You are sure about that...? Bikini: Yes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it! Edgeworth: ...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself. Bikini: Anyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out. von Karma: Like me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip. Edgeworth: (At least then it might bite you and not someone else...) Bikini: Iris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it! Judge: ...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh. Bikini: Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct? Judge: Which means... the victim's room was on the second floor? Bikini: No, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building. Judge: I see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct? Bikini: Yes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all... Bikini: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What makes you so sure of all this...? Bikini: It's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: You're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height. Judge: Hmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then. Bikini: Yep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (There's only two of them working there...!) von Karma: What's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark? Edgeworth: ... Present Elise's Autopsy Report Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\" Edgeworth: (...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.) Edgeworth: ...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway. Bikini: Oh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter! Edgeworth: However... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report? von Karma: T-The autopsy report...? Edgeworth: The victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed. von Karma: Ah...! Judge: T-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here! Edgeworth: The scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!? von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree? von Karma: Th-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Were there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: She was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree? Judge: W-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room. Judge: ...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah! von Karma: I'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood. Judge: When it produces the most blood...? von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: Indeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound. Judge: That's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking! von Karma: We have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions! Judge: Order! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events! Edgeworth: (I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!) von Karma: ...Hmph... Judge: It seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate! Bikini: Don't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood! von Karma: Sister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here. Edgeworth: (...With the whip?) Bikini: ...Oh, boy. Alright, alright... Witness Testimony -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. I've never seen so much blood before... That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Judge: Hmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory... von Karma: Von Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...) Cross Examination -- Further Details -- Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time... was the victim bleeding? Bikini: Well... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then. von Karma: ...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound. Edgeworth: In any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!? Bikini: Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Think carefully. This is very important. Bikini: It's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.) von Karma: The victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out? Bikini: That's right... Bikini: The whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah... Judge: It goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding. von Karma: ...Nothing out of place here. Edgeworth: (Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.) Present Shichishito Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\" Bikini: I've never seen so much blood before... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood? Bikini: T-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too... von Karma: When the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner. Edgeworth: Wh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?) Judge: Hmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me... Edgeworth: (What should I do...? Press this point further?) Stop here Edgeworth: (I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding! Leads back to cross-examination Press further Edgeworth: Going back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...? Bikini: Well, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw. Judge: W-What did you see? Bikini: Maybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day. Edgeworth: Pulling the sword out...? Bikini: Well, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\". Judge: Witness! You will add this statement to your testimony! Bikini: Oh... Was that important...!? Edgeworth: (More important than you can imagine...) Adds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...? Bikini: No mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day! Edgeworth: ...Don't you think that's a bit odd? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Why would the killer pull out the sword? von Karma: What...? Edgeworth: If all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Indeed... It is strange, now that you mention it. Edgeworth: (I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...) von Karma: A-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness? Bikini: That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Now, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct? Bikini: Well... I was unconscious... von Karma: How long were you out for? Bikini: I don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually. Judge: Hmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation! Bikini: Well, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you. Edgeworth: ...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...? Bikini: And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct? Bikini: Just stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough. Bikini: But to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...! von Karma: Truly, a heinous, despicable crime. Edgeworth: It is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily... von Karma: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem? Edgeworth: Exactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that? von Karma: ...! Judge: Hmmmmm... No, I don't think I can. von Karma: ... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts! Bikini: That's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself... Edgeworth: (\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.) Edgeworth: (There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.) Edgeworth: Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here. Bikini: W-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. von Karma: What contradictions are you talking about? Edgeworth: In the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities! Judge: What do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah! von Karma: Explain yourself! Edgeworth: To start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that. von Karma: von Karma: \"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose! Judge: The objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly. von Karma: T-That's... Edgeworth: We also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: T-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction. Judge: Y-You've still got more!? Edgeworth: ...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it? von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: If this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword! von Karma: Noooooo! Judge: Order! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa! von Karma: Bravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that! Judge: But what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but... Edgeworth: ...Having come this far, there can only be one answer. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito! Judge: W-Whaaaaaaaaat!? von Karma: A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool. Edgeworth: Let's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon? Bikini: W-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it... Edgeworth: ...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah! von Karma: So maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object. Judge: Hmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises. Judge: The obvious... question? Edgeworth: ...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: It goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found. von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Answer the question, Ms. von Karma! von Karma: ... No evidence of that kind was found. Judge: Hmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast! Bikini: Excuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually... von Karma: ...What is it, Sister? Bikini: I was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there... Judge: ... What exactly are you going on aboot here? Bikini: The murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of! Edgeworth: You what!? von Karma: Well then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister. Edgeworth: (Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?) Witness Testimony -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Judge: Hmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time. Bikini: Well. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know. von Karma: Quite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph. Judge: A snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory... von Karma: The tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge! Tracks Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: ...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon! Edgeworth: (Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- Location of the Weapon -- Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...You are sure about the time? Bikini: Yes... I was worried about it, after all. Judge: Why was that? Bikini: Because I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.) von Karma: Please continue, Sister. Bikini: And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct? Bikini: Right, right, the one who trampled me. Edgeworth: (It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...) Bikini: There isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him? Edgeworth: He had forgotten it at home, apparently. von Karma: What a na√Øve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too! Bikini: Anyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell. Bikini: And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited. Bikini: That's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls! Edgeworth: Now, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived? Bikini: Yes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate. von Karma: So... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time. Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?) Press further Edgeworth: (...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time? Bikini: Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean? Judge: What do you mean, eh? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used. Bikini: Ah! I see! I never thought of that! Judge: Hmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too! von Karma: ...Of course you did. Edgeworth: Then answer the question please, witness. Bikini: ... I don't often go around touching hot engines... Edgeworth: ...Hmm. Bikini: However... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it. Judge: Snow...? Bikini: Yes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow... Edgeworth: (There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!) Judge: It seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh! von Karma: How long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Stop here Edgeworth: (It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Judge: How long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Bikini: It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking. Bikini: Ah! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain? Judge: I think that's why the question was asked in the first place... Bikini: ...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch. Judge: Hmm... Crunch. Bikini: ...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then... Bikini: Anyway, the killer must have used it! Bikini: Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Refresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...? Bikini: Like I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes. von Karma: It's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile... Edgeworth: ...I have to concede that is more than enough time. von Karma: Is that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Bikini: ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: While it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here. Judge: Oh? And what would this mystery element be? Edgeworth: The killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods? Judge: Hmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah! von Karma: Turning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor. Judge: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (She's as over the top as always...) von Karma: A-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\" Edgeworth: (Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...) Edgeworth: I admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder. von Karma: You've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: However... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks? von Karma: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Iris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back. Bikini: ... Ah...! You're right! von Karma: Hmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...? von Karma: On the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it! Judge: I see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow. von Karma: What do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?) It's flawless. Edgeworth: ...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow. Edgeworth: I do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim. von Karma: ...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night? Bikini: Well... that would be...! von Karma: ...You can't hide it. I already know the answer. Bikini: ......... It could only be Iris. Judge: A-And the reason being...!? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. von Karma: A key... that the defendant is responsible for! Edgeworth: Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment. Judge: What is it, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: There is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim! Judge: ... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!? Edgeworth: Nngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!) Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" There is a contradiction. Leads to: \"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\" Edgeworth: The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible. von Karma: ... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction? Edgeworth: ...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me. Judge: On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow! Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Witness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime. Bikini: Like I said! It was around 11. Edgeworth: ...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder. Judge: The... weather report...? Edgeworth: Snow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Therefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up! von Karma: Aaah! Judge: O-Order! Order! Judge: Very well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah! von Karma: ...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things! Edgeworth: ... von Karma: Answer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!? Judge: Ah, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah! von Karma: Forecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM! Judge: Hmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh! Edgeworth: W-What!? (How did she pull that off!?) Judge: \"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this. Edgeworth: (I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony. von Karma: Hah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!? Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ... Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: It looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth... Edgeworth: ...! Judge: And to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry. Edgeworth: (This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.) von Karma: Respond! Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Even if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple! Leads back to: \"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\" Present Crime Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Here is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...? Judge: ... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case. Edgeworth: ... Nothing else...? Judge: Nothing else. von Karma: Oh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Nngh...! Edgeworth: (According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!) Leads back to: \"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\" Edgeworth: Ultimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed... von Karma: That's right. But proving that is... Edgeworth: Incredibly easy. von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: If we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception. von Karma: And that is...? Edgeworth: The victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why! von Karma: Gnnngh! Edgeworth: In other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks! von Karma: Aaaaah! Judge: Order! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah! von Karma: J-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing. von Karma: Of course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release) Edgeworth: Then when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained. Judge: Hmmmmm... Bikini: Can I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me... von Karma: ...What does, Sister? Bikini: There is only one key for the snowmobile. Edgeworth: ...! von Karma: Furthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder! Bikini: ...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple... Edgeworth: (But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...) Bikini: The snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot. Judge: ...That sounds right. Bikini: But... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge. von Karma: Y-You must have just failed to see it, Sister. Bikini: Maybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too... Edgeworth: B-But that... isn't possible! Judge: Order! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean? von Karma: ...Nngh... Edgeworth: So then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple! Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...) Judge: ... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release) Bikini: Yes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know. Judge: But then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile! Edgeworth: (A witness, huh...) Judge: Was there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night? Bikini: ... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do. Judge: Hmmmm... That's a shame. Edgeworth: (Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release) Judge: R-Really!? von Karma: ...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...? Edgeworth: I don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind. Judge: Which are...? Edgeworth: First... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder. von Karma: ...And the second being? Edgeworth: This individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!? Present Larry Butz profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: Just what is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth...? Are you saying that... this is the person who was near Dusky Bridge that night? Edgeworth: I-I did think so, however... Aaah! von Karma: You're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Cool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!) Judge: Hmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual... Did they really see the snowmobile that night? Leads back to: \"I don't know for sure if he saw it or not...\" Judge: This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"... Edgeworth: This is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim. Judge: Her student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder? Edgeworth: T-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason. von Karma: And so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw? Edgeworth: I intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom. Judge: Summon this youth as a witness immediately! von Karma: ... I have no choice, do I? Edgeworth: I believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him. Judge: ...Very well. Edgeworth: (Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!) Judge: ...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness. von Karma: ...Understood, Your Honor. Judge: Good... Well then! Court is now in recess! To be continued. February 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Iris: Excuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say... Edgeworth: Iris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene. Iris: ...Alright. I'll help you any way I can. Edgeworth: First, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: ...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile? Iris: ... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me. Edgeworth: So it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge? Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: Iris... Iris: I can't... tell you about that... yet. Edgeworth: \"Yet\"...? Iris: Not until her safety is confirmed... Edgeworth: Her? Iris: The safety of the acolyte... Edgeworth: (The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life. Edgeworth: ... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough. February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7 Judge: ...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...? von Karma: During the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery. Edgeworth: Suspicious behavior...? von Karma: He was sketching something... Very intensely. Judge: Dare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained? von Karma: He drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip. Judge: ... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah! von Karma: Anyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here! Edgeworth: (It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...) Butz: Ouch! von Karma: ...Your sketch is in contempt of this court! Butz: H-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch! von Karma: You tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct? Butz: L-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\". Edgeworth: ...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...? Butz: I know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it? Judge: Working in the fields...? Edgeworth: I presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope. Butz: Th-That's it! Thanks, buddy! Edgeworth: (It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...) Butz: I just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model! von Karma: ... Butz: So see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Judge: Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Stop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man! Judge: Refrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now! Butz: Waaaah... This is almost too much for me...! Witness Testimony -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... I didn't see a s-snowmobile! I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) The girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me... I'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!? Judge: Witness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony! Butz: I-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!? Judge: ... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex. Edgeworth: ...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people! Butz: Yeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy! Judge: ...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time. Cross Examination -- What I Saw -- Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Judge: What ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: This one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: So, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way. Butz: OK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a \"lodge\", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right? Edgeworth: ... von Karma: See? You can do it if you try. Butz: Heh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: ...There is only one issue here. What you saw at Dusky Bridge. Butz: I walked to the bridge a number of times, but... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"A number of times\"...? How many? Butz: Maybe... five times? I went once every twenty minutes. Edgeworth: Which means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night? Butz: You bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands! Judge: Love, you say...? Edgeworth: It was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter. Judge: B-Blackmail...!? Butz: No, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh! von Karma: You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness! Judge: So... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh! Butz: Um... well... You see... Edgeworth: (Being called those names doesn't seem to bother him at all...) Butz: I didn't see a s-snowmobile! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Larry! You really didn't see it? Butz: H-H-Hey! No need to hit your desk! I can hear you! ...I didn't see it! I didn't see a s-s-snowmobile! Edgeworth: ... Larry. Say \"snowmobile\" for me, please? Butz: S-S-S-Snowmobile. Edgeworth: If you truly have nothing to hide... ...then why are you stammering like you just flew over a cuckoo's nest!? Butz: Sh-Shut up! W-W-What is this!? I don't know! Don't ask me! Edgeworth: (It seems that I'll need to start from a more obvious contradiction. I'm going to strike the blow that will finally get him to spill the beans!) Butz: I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release) Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You didn't meet anyone? Butz: That's right. Because I've got nothing to do with this! And I'm just here to buy some viridian paint, OK!? Come on, I expect to see those crimson lake faces! Now! Judge: ... It would appear that simply pressing him isn't going to be enough, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry Butz...\" Edgeworth: (It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...) Edgeworth: Larry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble... Butz: I'm sorry...! Edgeworth: But... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction. Butz: Edgey! Are you... trying to console me? Judge: It certainly doesn't sound that way to me. Edgeworth: However... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create! Butz: Waaah... You're totally pinning this on me... Edgeworth: ...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz! Butz: ... That's right. Me, in the flesh. Judge: Hmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change! Butz: B-But...! What do you want me to do, then!? Edgeworth: Larry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well... Judge: I'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder? Witness Testimony -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. That's when I ran into Nick. Judge: Hmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you? von Karma: So... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire? Butz: It was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall. von Karma: W-What did you say!? Edgeworth: Oh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release) von Karma: ...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release) Judge: Now, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half? Butz: Well, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess. Judge: Hmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...? Butz: I set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too. Edgeworth: ...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end. von Karma: Because they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they? Butz: Shut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her. Butz: I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This \"light\" was, of course... Butz: Lightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah! von Karma: ...Or a little like that? Butz: Waaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda! Judge: Witness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge? Butz: Well, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so... Butz: I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Seeing that, what did you do? Butz: What do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart! von Karma: And that's why you went to take a look at the bridge? Butz: Well. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind. Judge: Hmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness. Butz: There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that? Butz: Hmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\" von Karma: How far is this small shack you were in from the bridge? Butz: Hold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk? Edgeworth: And how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there? Butz: Like I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare! Edgeworth: (...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?) Not right now. Edgeworth: (I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Why didn't you call anyone? Edgeworth: ...Larry. Let me ask you one thing. Butz: What is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face? Edgeworth: Why didn't you call anyone? Butz: Huh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Normally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct? Butz: ... Well, of course I thought of doing that. Judge: So then... let's hear why you didn't! Butz: H-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" Why did you go to the bridge? Edgeworth: So you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so? Butz: W-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there. Edgeworth: If that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning. Judge: In which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness! Butz: M-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" Butz: That's when I ran into Nick. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did Phoenix Wright look when you met him? Butz: Hmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment. von Karma: How far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge? Butz: On his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say. Judge: ...And that's when the murder was reported? Butz: That's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge! Butz: I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright? Butz: Y-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway. Edgeworth: (What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!) von Karma: It was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct? Butz: Yeah. That's pretty much it. More or less. Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\" Butz: I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you decided to go and see what was happening? Butz: That's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special? Edgeworth: (Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce \"spectacle\"?) Judge: Life seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt... Butz: Well, my motto is to \"hit life back as hard as I can.\" A-Agah! von Karma: ...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip. Edgeworth: (...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.) Edgeworth: Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not... Butz: What the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien! Edgeworth: But your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time. Butz: I've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those. Edgeworth: ...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct? Butz: Yeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less. Edgeworth: ...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM. Butz: ...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act. Edgeworth: That is impossible. von Karma: ...What do you mean? Edgeworth: 11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time! von Karma: ...! Butz: Ah! Excuse me! I-I have an objection! Judge: You do? Butz: Edgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah! von Karma: ...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that! Edgeworth: ...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM! von Karma: And why not!? Edgeworth: It is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM! Judge: Which means... what, exactly? Edgeworth: Wright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!? Butz: Urk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh! von Karma: ...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem! Butz: Yeah! Not much of a problem at all! Edgeworth: Really...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident? Judge: Yes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release) Edgeworth: And therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release) von Karma: Th-That's what it sounds like... Edgeworth: Ah, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release) Butz: ... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude. Edgeworth: ...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time. Butz: Listen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!? Edgeworth: Y-Yes... Butz: I may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah! von Karma: ...Then say it! Judge: Very well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!? Witness Testimony -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Judge: Hmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk... Butz: That's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch! Edgeworth: (...Including the truth, from the sound of it!) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts? Edgeworth: Not at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains. Judge: And what would that be? Edgeworth: This is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him! Butz: Hah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey! Cross Examination -- The Missing 15 Minutes -- Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tell us, Larry... Butz: My name is Laurice! Get it right! Mistakes like that are what keep you from being popular with the ladies like I am! Judge: ... Just who exactly are you!? Butz: I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Apprentice extraordinaire! Edgeworth: That's what he calls himself, in any case. Judge: ...Then you are... an artist? Butz: Of course! I'm an artist, the real thing! Edgeworth: Yet again, that's what he calls himself. von Karma: ...Names mean nothing. There is only one issue I care to discuss. What were you doing? Edgeworth: (That is a very big issue, indeed.) Butz: Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: S-Sketching!? The burning bridge? Butz: The burning bridge and everything that came with it! Edgeworth: ... What? \"Came with it\"...? Butz: You want to hear this from my lips, do you, Edgey!? Y-You'll regret this! That sketch of mine is... Gaaah! von Karma: ...Enough. Just take that ridiculous sketch of yours out already, witness! Butz: ... W-W-W-What are you talking about? I don't know what you mean! Judge: That does indeed appear to be the fastest solution. ...I'll leave it to you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (What should I do...? I've got a terrible feeling that the instant this sketch is revealed... ...the entire world may be changed by what is depicted there...!) Leave it alone Edgeworth: ...I cannot recommend looking at the sketch. His \"works of art\" are a force of nature best measured on the Richter scale. Butz: That's right! They'll shake your heart to pieces! Judge: Hmmmm... This courtroom has yet to meet earthquake standards! I think we'd better pass! ...In which case, let us turn to other leads. Leads back to cross-examination Look at the sketch Edgeworth: ...Larry. I wonder if you could show us your sketch. Please? Butz: ... Well, well... Even I couldn't have imagined it'd turn out like this. Edgeworth: ...Imagined what? Butz: That Laurice Deauxnim's debut would take place here, today, like this! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Show it! Now! Butz: OK... But steel yourselves! This... is the world of Laurice Deauxnim! Judge: ... Ah. Um... Well... So this... this is Dusky Bridge, correct? Q-Quite a large bridge, isn't it? Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Y-Yes, well... I-It's a better drawing than I expected. Butz: Isn't it? Isn't it? I struggled to reproduce those flames. I really did! Judge: ...Yes, I'm sure you did. ... von Karma: ...... Butz: ...... Edgeworth: (Nngh... This is going to get ugly... No one has the bravery to bring it up, it seems... This... mysterious flying object...) ...Larry. Butz: What? Edgeworth: The burning bridge is fine. But... What is that unfortunate looking figure...? Butz: Ah. You spotted that? I thought you might. Edgeworth: However much I might want to ignore it... I can't. Butz: It's Iris, of course! Iris! I wish she'd take better care of herself. We have to plan for our future, you know! What would've happened to her if she had injured herself flying like that...? Edgeworth: ... Larry, please. Answer this next question honestly. Butz: OK. Edgeworth: Are you REALLY claiming to have seen this? Are you claiming to have seen the silhouette of the defendant... ...flying over a bridge that was engulfed in flames...? Butz: Yep. That's what I saw. That's why I drew it! I'm an artist! A real artist! Edgeworth: Are...! von Karma: You...! Judge: High! The girl... She's really high up in this picture! Judge: Uwaaah! What was that for!? von Karma: ...This is all a bad dream. I was hitting you on the cheek to test that theory! Judge: Please whip your own cheek from now on if you wish to test your wild theories! A-Anyway! No court of law will ever acknowledge... ...that p-p-people can f-f-fly! von Karma: ...Actually, there is some precedent for this. Butz: She was flying pretty high, my sweet Iris. She was about 30 feet above the bridge, at least! It was really something to see! Judge: Th-This has to be some kind of m-m-mistake! ...Mr. Edgeworth, please bring the witness back down to earth! Edgeworth: What? Me...!? Judge: This witness is your friend, is he not? von Karma: \"Accessory to foolishness...\" ...Miles Edgeworth. Judge: Let us get back to the cross-examination! By force, if necessary! Mr. Edgeworth, I expect you to expose the obvious contradiction here! Edgeworth: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (Looks like I've got another reason to remember this moron...) Butz: ...Well, what did you think of my debut piece? Judge: Get that thing away from me! Larry's Sketch added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, hurry up and cross-examine him! Adds statement \"I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Could the reason you were so excited be...? Butz: What do you think!? My girlfriend was flying through the sky! Almost 30 feet above the bridge! I felt like I might start flying myself. Edgeworth: (If only you'd be so kind as to fly out of all of our lives...!) Butz: Anyway! I completely lost myself when I was drawing this scene! Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just where did you see this sight from!? Butz: Hey! No need to shout... When I was lying in bed in that run-down shack... The crack of the lightning bolt made me realize that the bridge was burning. I just watched it for a while from there, thinking how nicely it was burning! Then after about five minutes, I saw it. von Karma: The defendant \"flying\"...? Butz: That's right! That's when I decided to go to the bridge! Judge: ...I see. That all makes sense. Aside from the sketch itself... Edgeworth: (Yes... This sketch doesn't make any sense... I just need to convince the artist that his work is ludicrous.) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry. What did you really see that night...?\" Butz: The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The burning bridge moved you that much, did it? ...I find that hard to believe. Butz: You moron, Edgey! You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook! von Karma: An artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad! Butz: W-W-What has that got to do with anything!? Judge: I'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness. Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You transfered everything \"directly onto the page\"...? And that is this sketch here? Butz: Yep! Sensational, isn't it? Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway. von Karma: It did? Butz: That's right! The reason she didn't come to me, even though I waited for her... ...Was because she was trapped on the other side of the bridge! Judge: ... Butz: Could it be that Iris... ...undertook that dangerous, despereate flight in order to reach me...!? That's gotta be it! Alright! Go, me! Nice ooooooouch! von Karma: ...Continue. Please. Butz: ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot the passage of time to that extent, did you? Butz: Well... Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else... Edgeworth: (That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.) von Karma: Phoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts. Judge: Aside from doubts of his humanity, eh... Edgeworth: (There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!) Edgeworth: Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care. Butz: In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth! Edgeworth: If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain. Judge: What might that be...? Edgeworth: That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris! Butz: W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh! von Karma: A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim? Edgeworth: ...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct? Butz: Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah! von Karma: It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench. Edgeworth: ...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!? Butz: W-What are you talking about!? Edgeworth: ...I think you understand what I mean just fine. Butz: Why...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!? Edgeworth: What...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Butz: Edgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog! Judge: I do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage. Butz: ...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah! von Karma: ...What is it now, witness? Butz: It feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you! Edgeworth: W-What...!? Judge: What is the meaning of your outburst, witness!? Butz: ...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence. Edgeworth: \"Definitive\"...? von Karma: \"Evidence\"...? Butz: Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it! Judge: I didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality! Butz: ...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain! Edgeworth: (...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.) Witness Testimony -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Judge: A c-crystal sphere...!? Butz: This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers! von Karma: That sphere... Where did you find it? Butz: Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right. Edgeworth: And it was half-buried in the snow...? Butz: It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one! Butz: I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na√Øve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris! Iris: ... Phoenix: (Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?) To be continued. February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Edgeworth: Wright, is this what Godot was talking about? Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask‚òÜDeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: ‚ô™No motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!‚ô™ ‚ô™...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...‚ô™ Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! ‚ô™Good cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...‚ô™ Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! ‚ô™Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...‚ô™ Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting¬†??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you. (I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant secret left to unlock... Pearls's Psyche-Lock...) [sic] Revenge (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...)

Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: I think it's time you told the truth about what you were doing on that night. Iris: ... Phoenix: You said you were in your room at Hazakura Temple the entire time. Do you still claim that to be the truth? Iris: Yes... That's where I was. Phoenix: Iris... I believe you're innocent. That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder! Present Bikini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Iris!? I trust you, so you need to trust me. Iris: But, Mr. Wright... I can't. Phoenix: Why not? Iris: I can't trust such random nonsense! It doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I screwed up there...) Leads back to: \"Iris... I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... But mistakes just don't suit you. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: I had hoped you would get at least this much correct. I hate seeing you mess up and getting all disappointed. Phoenix: (Nngh... I didn't know she could be so harsh...) Phoenix: Iris, what are you trying to hide...? Iris: ...! Phoenix: The more you lie about it, the more I know it's got to be something really important. Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with?

It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" There were two of you. Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

They really did make a fire, right in front of the shack...) Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Butz: Hah! You're too late, Nick! If you came here for one of our potatoes, we've already polished them all off! Phoenix: (I think I've pretty much got all the evidence I need. Now I just need to find out what Pearls is hiding.) Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: I... After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?) Butz: It must've been pretty scary for you, Pearl. I know what it's like. Nick used to leave me behind when I fell asleep at school, too. Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure. I couldn't even grant my mother's final wish... Phoenix: Her \"final wish\"...? Pearl: Yes. This letter. \"This is my last wish,\" she said. \"So make sure you follow the instructions carefully.\" Phoenix: (Hmm... This letter... I definitely need to find out more about it.) Morgan's letter (appears after \"Lost powers\") Pearl: My mother has gone to a place called a \"penitentiary\". Phoenix: Yeah... I know, Pearls. Pearl: I visit her every month... And last month, she told me... Morgan: The time we've been waiting for has come, Pearl. There's something I need you to do for me. I hid a letter for you at our home before they brought me here. I want you to read it, and do exactly what it says. It's for the good of the Fey clan, my angel. You'll be doing a great thing. Now, listen carefully, and I'll tell you where the letter's hidden... Pearl: My mother is always nice to me... I love her very much! Butz: Yeah. Moms will do anything for their kids, right? Pearl: She said it was for the good of the Fey clan, so I knew I had to help her. I mean, Mystic Maya's part of the Fey clan, so it had to be good for her, too. That's right, isn't it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Usually, a picture is enough to channel someone's spirit, but this time... Butz: ...Pretty weird, huh? Phoenix: (Like Larry knows anything about this stuff!) Pearl: There's something else that was strange about my mother's letter... The seal on it was broken, as if someone had already opened it once before. Butz: ...That sure is pretty strange.

Pearl: Yes! I was so happy when she invited me! But... I didn't go in the end. Phoenix: You didn't go...? Pearl: ... No. There was somewhere else I had to go instead. I was so worried, I... I had to go. I didn't know what to do with myself. I was so nervous. Phoenix: (So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room... Because she was too worried about something or someone else...) ...Pearls. On the night of the murder, you went to this place, didn't you...?

Phoenix: If I'm right, will you tell me the whole truth? Pearl: ... O-OK... Phoenix: You went to this place for one very simple reason, and that is this: Present Maya Fey profile (after presenting Inner Temple) Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls.\" Otherwise Phoenix: Phoenix: Well Pearls? This is what you were worrying about, right? Pearl: ... There's something I'm worrying about right now, actually. Phoenix: What's that? Pearl: You, Mr. Nick. Your face has turned a really strange color. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You shouldn't work so hard, you know. You need to take a break once in a while. Phoenix: (...Being chided by a 9 year old. How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this! (I guess I'm going to have to think this through one more time from the very beginning.) Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: You knew the training Maya was undertaking was dangerous. After all, it was the Special Course. Pearl: ... Maya: I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why. The reason you were so worried about that bell was because of this: Present Burnt Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... You know, Mr. Nick, I think you should take a break now. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Even your hair's starting to look a bit tired. The spikes aren't looking so sharp.

I...\" Phoenix: You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: I presume you recognize these pieces of paper? Pearl: Aaaaah! Wh-Where did you...? Phoenix: In the incinerator at the Inner Temple. Pearls... You were following the instructions in this letter that night, weren't you? That's why you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell. Pearl: I... I'm speechless, Mr. Nick! You're amazing! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: These instructions that were found in the incinerator... I believe they were written for you, Pearls. Pearl: For me!? I... No...

Phoenix: Who was it, Pearls? Whose spirit were you supposed to be channeling? Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: (Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it... ...whose spirit would Pearls have been trying to channel? Don't over-think it, Phoenix! It's pretty obvious who Pearls was supposed to channel...) The person you were trying to channel that night, Pearls, was... Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Pearls? Am I right? Pearl: I... I can't channel anyone anymore. Pearl: A spirit medium who can't channel spirits... is like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: (Poor kid. It's really getting her down.) Pearl: But... I have never channeled that person's spirit! Phoenix: (I should have all the evidence I need, so what am I not getting here...?) Leads back to: \"Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it...\" Phoenix: It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter. Pearl: Ah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (It's just as I suspected... It wasn't Iris who Sister Bikini met at the Inner Temple that night... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Do you know anything about her, Pearls? Do you know what kind of a woman Dahlia Hawthorne was? Pearl: Umm... no. I've never heard of anyone by that name before reading those instructions... Phoenix: (I thought so. Pearls doesn't have a clue. She doesn't know that Dahlia is her sister...) About the instructions in the letter I found, Pearls... Who wrote them? Pearl: Umm... Phoenix: Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of... You must have quite a lot of respect for them. Pearl: ...

Pearl: But... ...I don't think I can trust you anymore. Phoenix: (Ouch... Pearls sure can be blunt when she wants to be... Alright now, think! Someone who Pearls would trust, no questions asked... There can't be many candidates for that post.) Leads back to: \"Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of...\" Phoenix: Pearls... I have to wonder about something... You didn't have any idea what these instructions meant, did you? Pearl: ...*ba-dump* Phoenix: But you followed them to the letter regardless. Why? Because it was your own mother who asked you. That's why. Pearl: H-How did you...? Phoenix: I figured it out. The person who wrote you this letter was your own mother, Morgan Fey! Pearl: Uh... Waaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Alright, Pearls! It's time you started telling me the truth. Pearl: M-M-Mr. N-Nick... I-I-I... Phoenix: (Why's she holding back from me? I don't like this...) Pearl: D-D-Don't underestimate m-me, j-just because I'm a ch-child! Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: If you're trying to say I followed these instructions... I'd l-like to see some proof! Phoenix: Whaaaat!? Pearl: Because... I... I d-don't think y-y-you have a-a-any! Phoenix: Nnnnnngh... (She'd say anything rather than admit to carrying out those instructions... I guess I'll have to produce some more evidence, then. One more thing should do it.) ...Alright, Pearls. We both know someone carried out these instructions on the night of the murder. But you're right. There's no evidence that proves it was you. Pearl: I-I-I knew it! Phoenix: However... I do know that whoever did it was a child. Pearl: Huh? H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: It couldn't have been an adult... No adult would've made a simple mistake like that. Pearl: A... simple mistake? What do you mean by that? Phoenix: I'm sure you thought you were carefully following the instructions you'd been given. But you misunderstood some of the words, and this is the evidence that proves it! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This shows the mistake you made! Pearl: ... Umm... I guess you know what I'm about to say, huh? I don't think it's me who made a mistake, Mr. Nick. It's you. Phoenix: (But the person who read these instructions must have been a child. That's why they misunderstood the meaning of that word... It's the only explanation for how such a simple mistake could've been made!) OK, Pearls. I'll go over it again. The person who read these instructions... Leads back to: \"It couldn't have been an adult...\" Phoenix: It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Wh-What!? Wh-Why would I d-do something like...? Phoenix: Do you remember what was written in that letter? \"Gravely roast the Master in the fires of Hades and bring our vengeance to fruition.\" But you didn't know how to read the words \"gravely\" and \"roast\" among others, right? Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea... Phoenix: Just a tiny bit. Pearl: I... I really am useless! I couldn't even burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me... (Changed from [I didn't even manage to burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me...] in the original release) Such a simple thing... And I couldn't even do it right... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful After clearing \"The night of the crime\" and \"Morgan's letter\" Talk options: Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. You really helped me out. Pearl: You're very welcome! My mother is watching over us! So I'm sure Mystic Maya will be alright! Phoenix: ... (Look at that innocent smile on her face. What am I supposed to say to her?) ???: Ha...! Godot: Finally figured it out, have you, Trite? You've finally realized how terrible of a crime being painfully oblivious is. Phoenix: G-Godot! Godot: The entrance to the Sacred Cavern looks like a freaking puzzle workshop. Phoenix: (I guess he's talking about Iris and the lock-breaking effort...) Godot: ...But it's all a waste of time. Phoenix: W-Why do you say that? Godot: Because Maya Fey isn't coming back. Phoenix: What? You don't know what you're talking about! How can you say something like that? Godot: It was your job to protect her, Trite. Just like it was your job to protect Mia Fey... Two sisters, caught up in the worst circumstances. Phoenix: I... I realize that, but... Godot: And you were the only one who was by their sides. You were the only one who could have saved them. Phoenix: But I didn't know anything about what was going on! Godot: Ha...! What did I just say, Trite? Being oblivious is a heinous crime in itself. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Tomorrow... We'll settle everything in court tomorrow. ...Once and for all. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick... Is... Is what that man just said true? Phoenix: It'll be alright, Pearls. I'm sure Maya's alive. You'll see for yourself tomorrow! Pearl: I... Yeah! That's right! I know I can trust you, Mr. Nick! Morgan: ...My dear Pearl... ...You've done so well, my child. My Pearl... ...It's better that you don't know what you've done... (Changed from [...It's better that you don't know...] in the original release) ...I knew this day would come for you... ...The blood of the main family is no more... ...Now, finally... After all this time... the Master's seat is yours... (Changed from [...Now you... You are to take the place at the head of the Fey clan...] in the original release) ...My last, great wish... It seems I was just in time... To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Nothing to examine during metal detecting session Phoenix: Hmm... It doesn't look like there's anything here. Gumshoe: Hey, pal! All you gotta do is watch the detector and let IT tell YOU what's where, OK! (Changed from [Hey, pal! You've gotta watch the CHECK gauge and wait for it to flash, OK!?] in the original release) Phoenix: (Alright, already... I'm not exactly a wiz at machinery, you know...)\n-- The Killer --Maya: ...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you lost consciousness when you were in the garden. Is that right? Maya: Yes. I think... I think it happened when the v-victim was stabbed. Phoenix: So then the person that carried you into the Inner Temple...? Judge: It could only have been the killer...! Godot: ... Maya: That's what I think, too. Phoenix: (So the killer carried Maya into the Inner Temple...)Maya: By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... ...... I don't know. Phoenix: (It looks like she doesn't have enough confidence. I think I need to gather some more information before I ask her again...)Press (after pressing third and fourth statements) Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something. Phoenix: You did? Maya: Yes... I felt like the killer was hiding the evidence for me... for my sake... Judge: Wh-What? Hiding it for you...!? Maya: Everyone knew that I was the only one at the Inner Temple that night. If Sister Bikini had come back and looked at the garden... Phoenix: ...She may have thought that you had done it... Judge: ...No, she definitely would have thought so. And you're saying that's why the killer... ...cleaned up the crime scene to make it look like nothing had happened...? Maya: Yes. I'm sure of it. Judge: Well, that's certainly an important piece of information! I want you to add that to your testimony! Maya: Yes, Your Honor... Adds statement \"I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.\"Press (after pressing third and fourth statements; subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something. Phoenix: You did?Maya: I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: They did it for your sake...? Maya: Well... If the body and the blood hadn't been removed... ...I would've immediately been the prime suspect, right? Judge: Yes, I suppose that's true. Phoenix: (Yeah, and if that happened, the body would have caused some other problems, too. If her real identity had come out right then, it would have been terrible. \"Master of Kurain Killed by Own Daughter!\" I don't think Maya would've been able to handle it...) Judge: But still... It's rather difficult to fathom the killer's motives. What reason is there to go through that much trouble to protect you...? Maya: ...Present Stone Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard.\"Maya: The torches were lit... And the body was gone.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The torches were lit? Maya: Yes. That's how I noticed that the whole scene had changed. Phoenix: (I'm going to say it was the killer who lit the torches... I mean, who else could it be?) Judge: The killer probably lit them since it'd be impossible to do any cover-up work in the dark. However, if that's true, there's one thing that still bothers me. Why did the killer go to the effort of moving the body? Phoenix: (That's true... It's hard to see how that would be of any advantage to the killer. The only one who would gain anything from that would be... ...the only person that was at the Inner Temple, Maya.) Maya: ... Judge: Very well... Let me hear some more about the condition of the crime scene.Maya: And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're saying the killer cleaned up the snow? (It did look really odd... The snow was removed in an unnatural-looking rectangular shape around the lantern...) Maya: There were a lot of shovels around the Inner Temple. But they're all really heavy. Way too heavy for me to use. Judge: ...An odd fellow indeed, this killer. Why on earth would anyone want to take snow away? Phoenix: Well there's one thing I can think of... Didn't you say that a lot of the victim's blood sprayed onto the snow? Maya: Y-Yeah... The area I collapsed in ended up being splattered. Phoenix: In other words... ...the killer's purpose was to hide the bloody snow. I think that's the most reasonable explanation. Judge: Hmm, perhaps... However, there's something that's bothering me. If the killer just wanted to hide the snow with blood on it... ...there was no need to remove that amount. Phoenix: (That's true... He could have scooped up just the snow that was stained with blood.) Judge: It looks like there are some mysteries behind this issue. Maya: ...But, I think this will help explain them!Maya: Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you're saying that you never saw the killer, right? Maya: Y-Yes. Phoenix: But earlier you very clearly stated that... ...you saw a man behind your attacker. Maya: ... Nick... I'm sorry...Phoenix: (The killer certainly went through a lot of trouble... Moving the body by pendulum, manipulating the crime scene... But for what purpose...? Why do all that? Maybe Maya knows more than she's letting on...)Phoenix: The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard. Then at the garden, the real scene of the crime... ...the snow that we suspect was covered in blood was scooped up and removed. It's reasonable to believe all this was done in an attempt to hide the true crime scene. However... There's still one matter that still seems somewhat odd.Godot: Oh? And what would that be?Phoenix: You must have figured it out by now, Mr. Godot... It's the message written in blood on the lantern.Godot: ...!Phoenix: It was written very clearly on the white stone lantern. \"Maya\"...Maya: Ah...Phoenix: If the killer was so motivated to protect Maya from suspicion... ...then why didn't they wipe the writing off the lantern? (Changed from [...then why didn't he wipe the writing off the lantern?] in the original release)Judge: Aaaaaaah! You're right! Order! Order! Order! B-But, Mr. Wright! Isn't it a fact that the killer was trying to cover up the crime scene...?Phoenix: Indeed. But it doesn't make much sense to move the body and remove the bloody snow... ...then not wipe off the most incriminating thing of all -- the bloody writing!Godot:Godot: But if that's the case... ...do you have an explanation for the killer's mysterious behavior? Why would this killer move the body and remove all that snow... ...but then leave the bloody writing on the lantern...?Phoenix: (I don't know what the killer's plan was... ...but it's a fact that the killer left the writing on the lantern. There must be a reason for it!)Judge: Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion. Why did the killer leave the message written in blood on the lantern?The killer wrote it. Phoenix: There's only one reason... And it's easier to spot than Sister Bikini in a bikini. It's because the killer is the one who wrote it! Judge: ...... Maya: ...... Godot: ...... Phoenix: ...Huh? Judge: ...Too bad, Mr. Wright. Don't you remember the testimony of that rather pathetic, vile woman? Dahlia: I think... I think I was stabbed. Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on Maya. Phoenix: ... Oh yeah... She did say that, didn't she...? Godot: Ha...! You and Dahlia... I'm not sure which one of you is more pathetic! Phoenix: Ugggghhh! Phoenix: (I've got to recall everything I've seen and heard up to this point! The answer is there somewhere!) Leads back to: \"Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion.\"To pin the crime on Maya. Phoenix: There's only one reason! One as obvious as Jean Armstrong in a thong on the Riviera! ...The killer was trying to pin the crime on Maya! Judge: ...... Maya: ...... Godot: ...... Phoenix: ...Huh? Maya: Umm, Nick. I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this, but... If the killer had meant to put the blame on me... ...then why didn't the killer leave the crime scene as it was? Phoenix: Oh... Judge: Once again, you've been pointing that finger where it doesn't belong! Phoenix: Ugggghhh! Phoenix: (I've got to recall everything I've seen and heard up to this point! The answer is there somewhere!) Leads back to: \"Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion.\"The killer didn't notice it. Leads to: \"...Prosecutor Godot. Earlier in this trial, you gave me some good advice.\"Phoenix: ...Prosecutor Godot. Earlier in this trial, you gave me some good advice. \"Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth.\"Godot: Maybe you're not as dumb as I thought.Phoenix: The real killer wanted to disguise the fact that a crime occurred there. If that's the case... They wouldn't have left the bloody writing on the stone lantern on purpose! Therefore, it must mean that they didn't notice it...Maya: B-But... That doesn't make any sense! The torches were all lit and everything... There's no way any normal person would miss something as glaring as that!Phoenix: You're right... There is no way any \"normal\" person would.Judge: What...? What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: There's only one person involved in this incident... ...who could have missed seeing the bloody writing altogether.Judge: And who would that be!? Who is the person that could have failed to notice the bloody writing!?Present Godot profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Godot...\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: ...I think I'll leave some bloody writing when I die, too. I'll write... \"Wright Left\". Phoenix: H-Huh? Judge: You have no idea what you're talking about, do you? Phoenix: (Is he telling me I need to leave the courtroom...?) Godot: Hey, Trite... You can play after the trial is over! Phoenix: (I'm sure I'm on the right track! I've just got to think more carefully about all that's happened up to this point!) Leads back to: \"There's only one person involved in this incident...\"Phoenix: Mr. Godot... This is what you said yesterday...Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.Judge: You can't see everything!? Is that correct, Mr. Godot!?Godot: ...Phoenix: This lantern was submitted as evidence today. I would like the court to think back to the moment it was first presented.Judge: Th-This lantern... There's something written on it! Wh-Why... It's written in blood!Godot: Hmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!Phoenix: ...Mr. Godot. Just admit it. There are certain colors you can't see... Correct?Godot: ...Phoenix: You can't see red on a white background, can you? ...That's right. We went through this once before. During the poisoning case at Tr√©s Bien...Godot: This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. And somehow spilled coffee on.Judge: There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot: Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge: Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot: That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix: You could see the coffee on the white apron... ...But you couldn't see the ketchup. Because it was red.Godot: ... Ha...! It's strange... In a black and white photo, those letters would have appeared black to me... I wonder... Why am I the only one that can't see them...?Judge: S-So then... Mr. Godot! Are you admitting it!? Are you admitting that you can't see the red writing on the lantern!? (Changed from [Are you admitting that you couldn't see the red writing on the lantern!?] in the original release)Godot: ...Hey, gramps. Didn't you know? That's the reason why I don't drink red tea!Phoenix: (I wasn't sure about it until now, but... I just can't believe it... Prosecutor Godot is the murderer! But... There's no going back now. I've finally figured out the truth...!) ...Mr. Godot. The defense at this time formally accuses you. You are the murderer of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, also known as Ms. Misty Fey!Judge: It's hard to believe this may be true. However... ...once again Mr. Wright has brought up a disquieting fact about you!Godot: Ha...! Just make sure you don't fill out the indictment in red ink, gramps. Come on... How does a little graffiti make me into the killer?Phoenix: ...!Godot: Besides, it's not like it's my name that's written there.Phoenix:Phoenix: I'm certain that the killer wasn't able to see the color red!Godot: This is rich. Do go on, Trite.Phoenix: The answer is right there at the crime scene. In the snow...Judge: The snow? How so?Phoenix: Well, for example, why did the killer move all that snow...? Your Honor, you said it yourself. If they wanted to hide the bloody snow, why not take out just that area?Judge: Yes, why didn't he take just that area...? Ah! C-Could it be...!? (Changed from [Yes, why didn't they take just that area...? Ah! C-Could it be...!?] in the original release)Phoenix: Yes. The killer couldn't see the red blood that had seeped into the snow. And so, he had to remove all of the snow! He couldn't be sure of where the blood had landed, so he removed the whole area!Godot:Godot: Isn't it more likely that the killer couldn't see the blood because it was dark?Phoenix: ...Not a chance. The torches were all lit. He would have been able to see just fine. (Changed from [The torches were all lit. They would have been able to see fine.] in the original release)Judge: ......It seems... ...that once again, this trial has taken an unexpected turn, to say the least. Can you explain this, Mr. Godot!????:Maya: W-Wait! Wait just a minute! (Changed from [W-Wait! Just wait a minute!] in the original release)Phoenix: Maya!Judge: Wh-What is it, witness?Maya: M-Mr. Godot... isn't the killer...! After all, he didn't even come to the Inner Temple... ...until 2 days after the murder took place! He didn't show up until after that old bridge got fixed up!Godot:Godot: Maya...Maya: ...!Godot: You can't testify to something like that.Maya: Why...? What do you mean!? I may not look it, but I'm-- Eeeeeeeek!!Godot: After the murder happened... you didn't even exist.Judge: She didn't...? I'm afraid I don't follow...Godot: Are you senile, old man? We established this just a little while ago. After the murder, this witness was unconscious for a long time. Because she was channeling Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge: Oh... That's right...Maya: P-Please, Your Honor! Let me add to my testimony! ...Nick! Please listen to me...!Phoenix: ...... (Maya... Do you plan to cover for Godot no matter what the cost...? If that's the case, then I've got no choice.) ...Your Honor! Let's hear her testimony. If it means we're going to hear the whole truth, I say we should not silence her.Godot: Ha...! Nicely done, Trite.Judge: Very well, let's hear the witness's testimony. Please tell us what happened at the Inner Temple after the murder.Maya: Yes, sir. After I woke up, I began channeling and my spirit \"left me\", as it were. But that little girl was there at the Inner Temple, too!Witness Testimony-- After the Incident --Maya: Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night! The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone. The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room. That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time! He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!Judge: Who is this \"Pearly\"...?Maya: That's my little cousin! Pearl Fey.Judge: Hmm... So when did you hear about this?Maya: Oh, just a while ago... When I was in the medical office.Judge: I'm terribly sorry... But what you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.Maya: Whaaaat!? Come on! Pearly would never tell a lie! She's a way more honest person than I'll ever be!Phoenix: (Real smart, Maya. You always know the best things to say when you're under oath...)Godot: Ha...! The prosecution has no objection. We believe the witness.Judge: M-Mr. Godot!Godot: Let's just move on to the cross-examination... If the defense has no objections...Judge: Th-This is highly unusual, but... Well, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: ... Let's get this cross-examination started.Godot: ...Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- After the Incident --Maya: Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So where did do you think Pearls slept that night? Maya: In the spare prep room next to the Training Hall, I guess. There's a rule that you can't enter the Training Hall during an acolyte's training. Judge: But even so, why did she go to the Inner Temple in the first place? Phoenix: It seems that Pearls became very worried about Maya. Maya: She knew that the spiritual training I was about to undergo was very intense. Phoenix: (Pearls was supposed to channel Dahlia Hawthorne... But she couldn't do it. That's why she headed to the Inner Temple. However, Dahlia Hawthorne was already there... ...possessing the body of Elise Deauxnim.)Maya: The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She searched the entire Inner Temple side, end to end...? Maya: Well, you see... Pearly gets pretty scared when she's alone. And there weren't that many places to look... She says that she even went back and forth several times. Phoenix: The Inner Temple side has two structures: the Training Hall and a spare prep room... Maya: And there's also a storage shack, I think... That's about it. Phoenix: (There was a storage shack, too?) ...Pearls was looking for other people, right? Phoenix: Would she have really examined a storage shack all that carefully...? Maya: ... Well, if it was me, that would be the first place I would investigate! Judge: Hmm... So that means it's possible that someone may have been hiding in the storage shack.Maya: The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Pearls didn't hear the sound of them working on the bridge? Maya: What do you mean? Phoenix: I was just wondering why she would stay in the prep room. If it was me, I'd at least go out and wait at the foot of the bridge. Maya: ...Oh. Well, Pearly said she was sleeping at the time. She said she was so scared during the night... ...that she couldn't sleep well and woke up a bunch of times. Judge: Poor little girl... All alone like that... Godot: Well, we know that she had at least one friend in the Sacred Cavern. ...Dahlia Hawthorne, who was busy battling with the trick lock... Phoenix: (She couldn't let anyone see her... So she wouldn't have shown herself to Pearls.) Godot: What happened after the bridge was finally fixed...?Maya: That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So it was your first time on the Inner Temple side, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hmm? That's funny. Am I imagining things, or did the defense ask me a question? Judge: ...Mr. Wright, please save your questions for the witness. Phoenix: \"What you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.\" Those are your words. ...Your Honor. Judge: ... Touch√©, Mr. Wright. Oh well... What do you have to say, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hot nights and even hotter coffee... That's what I always say. If it hadn't have been for this case, I never would have visited there. A freezing cold temple in the mountains... I think I'll pass! Phoenix: (So he had never visited Hazakura Temple or the Inner Temple, huh...?) Godot: ...Ha! You want to say something, Trite? Phoenix: (In any case, I have to find a crack in Godot's armor! While I cross-examine Maya, that is...) Judge: Very well, please go on with your testimony. After fixing the bridge, the policemen came over to the Inner Temple side, right? Maya: Yes! Then Mr. Godot...Press (after selecting \"Godot's investigation\" upon pressing fifth statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: So it was your first time on the Inner Temple side, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hmm? That's funny. Am I imagining things, or did the defense ask me a question? Judge: ...Mr. Wright, please save your questions for the witness. Phoenix: \"What you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.\" Those are your words. ...Your Honor. Judge: ... Touch√©, Mr. Wright. Oh well... What do you have to say, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hot nights and even hotter coffee... That's what I always say. If it hadn't have been for this case, I never would have visited there. A freezing cold temple in the mountains... I think I'll pass! Phoenix: (So he had never visited Hazakura Temple or the Inner Temple, huh...?) Godot: ...Ha! You want to say something, Trite? Phoenix: (It's just like I thought. Godot is lying! If his first visit to the Inner Temple really was after the incident.. He shouldn't know about that piece of evidence!) Judge: Very well, please go on with your testimony. After fixing the bridge, the policemen came over to the Inner Temple side, right? Maya: Yes! Then Mr. Godot...Present Hanging Scroll (after selecting \"Godot's investigation\" upon pressing fifth statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Mr. Godot.\"Maya: He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: H-He cheered her up...? Maya: That's what Pearly said... She said he was a very nice older gentleman. Thank you for looking after my cousin, Mr. Godot! Judge: And here I was thinking you were nothing more than a coffee-addict. Godot: Ha...! Cut it out... ...You're making me blush. Phoenix: (This guy is really beginning to get on my nerves... In more ways than one...) Godot: The truth is there aren't that many places to look on the Inner Temple side. The policemen were all busy going over the garden with fine-toothed combs. So I decided to carry out an investigation in my own way... Godot-style! Judge: I'm the same way. I like to hand down verdicts in my own way, Judge-style! Phoenix: (Hmm, maybe I should ask some questions, Phoenix-Style...) Forget it Judge: How about it, Mr. Wright? Do you have anything to add? Phoenix: No. I give up... This whole Phoenix-style thing, I mean. Judge: It seems... ...this phrase has become overused, so I'm putting an end to it... Judge-style. Phoenix: (Then let it go already!) Leads back to cross-examination Cheering Pearls up Phoenix: So you cheered Pearls up? Godot: When I found that little girl... ...the first thing she asked about was her cousin, Maya Fey. Maya: Really...? Godot: The bridge had burned down and she was huddled up in that tiny shack with no heat... Even though she must have had a truly terrifying night out there... ...she asked about you before she said a thing about herself. Maya: P-Pearly... Godot: I noticed that you weren't anywhere on the Inner Temple side. But... I couldn't find it in me to tell her that. So I gave her my last cup. With milk and sugar... To hide the bitterness of the harsh truth. Judge: Wh-What a sweet story... *sniffle* Phoenix: (He had a thermos of coffee? Why doesn't that surprise me?) Leads back to cross-examination Godot's investigation Phoenix: You said that you conducted an investigation of your own. Did you find anything? Godot: It looks like my investigation went about as well as yours, Trite. After all, I did miss the bloody writing on the lantern. Phoenix: (Well, I didn't miss it, so speak for yourself, Goggles!) Godot: The only odd thing I discovered was the beauty in the Training Hall. Phoenix: Beauty...? Godot: ...Misty Fey, naturally. Clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes. Phoenix: (Western tastes...? Could he find a stranger way to describe gravy...?) Judge: So from there you headed for the prep room? Phoenix: ...... (Wait a sec... What did Godot say just now? I think I just found his proverbial weak spot!) Leads back to cross-examinationPhoenix: (There's only one thing of any importance here... Where was Godot when the murder was taking place? He must have already been at the Inner Temple when it happened.

The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Testimony 3 states: \"That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!\" which means, according to Maya, Godot's first visit to the Inner Temple was after the bridge was repaired. However, the Hanging Scroll (Evidence 4) contains gravy stains that Godot himself described as \"the hue and aroma of Western tastes,\" implying he saw the scroll before the bridge was repaired, at a time he shouldn't have been able to access the Inner Temple. This creates a contradiction: Godot could only know about the gravy (covered scroll) if he had been inside the Inner Temple before the repair, contradicting Maya's testimony.\n",

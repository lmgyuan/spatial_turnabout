    "cot": "The testimonies by Larry Butz indicate that he was out on the lake in a boat, heard a single gunshot (\"bang\"), and then went home (Testimonies 0, 3, and 5). However, Testimony 4 by Butz states he looked out over the lake but didn't notice the boat. This contradicts the existence or presence of the boat that Butz claims to have been in.\n\nEvidence 4 is the Lake Photo, which should presumably show the lake and possibly the boat. If the photo clearly shows no boat on the lake at the time Butz claims to be there, then this evidence contradicts Butz's testimony about being in the boat on the lake.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction could be between Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) and Testimony 0 or 4 (Butz's boat presence and observation).\n\nChoosing the most directly conflicting pair:\n- Testimony 0: Butz says he was out on a boat on the lake.\n- Evidence 4: Presumably the Lake Photo shows no boat or something that contradicts Butz's claim.\n\nHence,\n",

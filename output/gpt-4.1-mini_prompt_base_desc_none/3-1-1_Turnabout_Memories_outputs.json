    "cot": "Evidence 4 is \"Coldkiller X\" which likely references a person or alias known for murder or violent acts. Testimony 3 is \"I never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!\" by Phoenix, which suggests Phoenix is distancing himself from someone, potentially the victim or suspect connected to Coldkiller X. If Coldkiller X is connected to this British person who is central to the case, then Phoenix's claim in Testimony 3 contradicts the implication or evidence surrounding Coldkiller X.\n\nHowever, testifying that he never talked to the person, while evidence suggests involvement by or interaction with Coldkiller X, would be a contradiction. Thus, the pair of Evidence 4 (Coldkiller X) and Testimony 3 (Phoenix's statement about never talking to the British person) are contradictory.\n",

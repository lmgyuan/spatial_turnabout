    "cot": "The White Cat Photograph and Pawnbroker's Tickets (Evidence 2 and Evidence 4) suggest the involvement of certain items and perhaps individuals, whereas Testimony 3 by Nash claims the bloke who owned the place was holding a gun and should have fired rather than yelling. This might conflict with the evidence on who actually had the gun or was the shooter. However, these are two pieces of evidence and one testimony, and the prompt asks for one evidence and one testimony.\n\nAnother possible contradiction is the testimonies by Nash (Testimony 6) stating \"We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?\" vs the evidence of guns (Evidence 12: Windibank's Gun, Evidence 13: Skulkin Brothers' Gun) and the crime scene evidence (Evidence 10, 11). If the evidence shows that the Skulkin brothers' gun was used in the shooting, this contradicts Nash's statement he didn't have a chance and could not have shot.\n\nSpecifically, Testimony 1 and 2 by Ringo discuss hearing the gunshot and hearing someone yell \"Gimme that gun!\" which may conflict with Nash's statements (Testimonies 0,3,4,6) about the shooter or the scenario. However, more clearly, Testimony 6 states they could not have shot the pawnbroker, while the presence of the Skulkin brothers' gun (Evidence 13) and crime scene evidence likely points otherwise.\n\nHence, the contradiction pair is:\n\nEvidence 13: Skulkin Brothers' Gun\n\nTestimony 6: \"We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?\" - Nash\n",

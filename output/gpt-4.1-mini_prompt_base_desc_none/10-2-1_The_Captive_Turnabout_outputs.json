However, in Testimony 4, Elbird claims that he \"couldn't do anything since I was locked up in my cell,\" which contradicts the previous statement about being in the same room and training.\n\nNow, considering the evidence, the \"Prison Roll Call\" (Evidence 8) suggests a formal procedure where prisoners would be accounted for and presumably locked back into their cells after recreation time. This procedure would mean that Elbird should have been in his cell, conflicting with his claim of being free to go to training in the room.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 8 (Prison Roll Call) which implies prisoners were locked up after recreation, and Testimony 1, where Elbird says he was not locked up but went straight to training.\n",

    "cot": "Evidence 15 is \"Security Camera Footage\" and testimonies 1 and 2 state that Sahwit got curious and peeked through the window on the door in person. If the security camera footage shows that Sahwit was never near the door or did not peek through the window, this would contradict testimonies 1 and 2. However, since we only need to find one pair and there is no direct indication about the footage contradicting these testimonies in the provided data, let's look for a clearer pair.\n\nTestimonies 0 to 4 are all from Sahwit, describing his actions in sequence. There's no direct contradiction in these testimonies themselves.\n\nNow, consider the Pocket Chess Set (Evidence 3) and Dog Chess Piece (Evidence 11) along with Testimony 0 where Sahwit says he was in the workroom practicing his skills. If the chess pieces were found in Mr. Knight's room (Evidence 2: Mr. Knight's Body) or somewhere else, it might contradict testimony that Sahwit was practicing chess skills in the workroom. Yet, this is a stretch as the pocket chess set could be anywhere.\n\nLooking at Evidence 7 Door Sensor and Sahwit's testimony that he peeked through the small window on the door (Testimonies 1 and 2). If the Door Sensor shows that the door was never opened or used at that time, this could contradict Sahwit's claim of peeking through the door.\n\nSince a door sensor would detect opening or usage and Sahwit says he peeked through a small window (which doesn't require door opening), the door might not have opened but he could still have peeked.\n\nAlternatively, consider Evidence 20 Autopsy Report which might state the time of death. If it contradicts Sahwit's claim of when he found the body (Testimony 3: \"Then I saw him lying there... dead!\") by showing the victim died earlier or later than Sahwit claims, that would be a direct contradiction.\n\nGiven the data, the clearest contradiction is between \"Testimony 3: Then I saw him lying there... A man... not moving... dead!\" by Sahwit, and potentially the \"Autopsy Report\" (Evidence 20), which might indicate the time of death does not match Sahwit's claim of discovering the body.\n\nTherefore, these two are a likely contradicting pair.\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 3 states, \"The moment I realized that the man inside was dead, I let out a scream,\" which implies that the man was recently dead or the death was just realized. Testimony 5 says, \"He most likely had passed away already. His hands moved nary an inch,\" indicating the man was not moving at all, presumably dead for some time. These two testimonies might not directly contradict, but they align. \n\nNow, considering the evidence:\n\nEvidence 2 is \"Mr. Knight's Body\" and Evidence 6 is the \"Bloodstained Sheet,\" which would typically imply a fresh or recent event indicating a scene where the death occurred.\n\nTestimony 4 states, \"And to my horror, there was a black dog biting his neck!\" which seems very specific and notable. Evidence 9 is \"Black Dog.\" However, a biting dog could indicate someone or something attacking, while other testimonies imply a more passive or already dead state.\n\nTestimony 1 says, \"If the hand with the bracelet stays in the room, you can step out without sounding the alarm,\" and Evidence 10 is \"Sahwit's Bracelet.\" This suggests some trick to avoid the alarm.\n\nTestimony 15 refers to \"Security Camera Footage,\" which may show a timeline contradicting someone's alibi or statements.\n\nGiven the data, the direct contradiction is between:\n\nTestimony 3: \"The moment I realized that the man inside was dead, I let out a scream.\" \n\nand\n\nEvidence 15: \"Security Camera Footage,\" which presumably recorded no person entering or exiting at that time (implied; security footage showing something that contradicts the moment of scream). \n\nAssuming the security footage shows no one entering or leaving at the time of the scream, the statement about realizing the man inside was dead then contradicts the footage.\n\nTherefore, the pair of contradictory evidence and testimony is:\n\nEvidence 15 (Security Camera Footage) and Testimony 3 (moment of realizing the dead man).\n",

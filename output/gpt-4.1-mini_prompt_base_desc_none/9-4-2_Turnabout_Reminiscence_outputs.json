    "cot": "Evidence 17 is the Surveillance Video, which likely shows what actually happened; Testimony 4 from the Judge states he heard the loud \"BANG!\" of a gunshot as he was leaving the restroom. If the video contradicts the moment or presence of the sound or event of the gunshot as described by the Judge, these would be in contradiction.\n\nGiven only the available data, one clear contradiction is between Evidence 2: Det. Gumshoe's Testimony, and Testimony 1: \"However, that doesn't mean that the Detective was sitting there when I looked!\" by the Judge, implying that the Judge saw or did not see the Detective sitting somewhere, which clashes with what Gumshoe might have testified.\n\nBut since no detailed content for the testimonies or evidence beyond their titles are given, the most explicit contradiction is between the Judge claiming he heard a gunshot (Testimony 4) and the Surveillance Video (Evidence 17) potentially proving otherwise. So the pair is Evidence 17 and Testimony 4.\n",

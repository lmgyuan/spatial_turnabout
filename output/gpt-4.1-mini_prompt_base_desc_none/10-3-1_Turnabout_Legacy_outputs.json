    "cot": "Testimony 3 states that \"He couldn't move the body, but it was easy to move the murder weapon,\" implying that the murder weapon was moved from the crime scene. Testimony 2 suggests that if the murder weapon had been left at the crime scene, the Master would have been suspected. This implies the murder weapon was not left at the crime scene, but the key part is about moving the weapon.\n\nEvidence 6, \"Mansion Key,\" and Evidence 11, \"Mr. Frost's Room,\" combined with testimony stating that the murder weapon was deposited in Delicia's room, would mean that the weapon was indeed moved.\n\nHowever, the contradiction arises with Evidence 15, \"Victim's Blood,\" which would logically be found at the crime scene, potentially on the weapon if it was left there.\n\nHowever, the strongest direct contradiction can be seen with Evidence 27, \"Salt Lamp,\" which von Karma claims was used as the murder weapon and then deposited in Delicia's room (Testimony 1). If the Salt Lamp was used as the murder weapon, it should have traces of Victim’s Blood (Evidence 15) at the murder scene or on the lamp itself. If the Salt Lamp was moved, and no direct evidence ties it to the murder scene, this could be examined further.\n\nBut the prompt asks specifically for an evidence and testimony pair that contradict each other.\n\nTestimony 4 says, \"Ergo, there would be no evidence pointing to a specific culprit at the crime scene,\" but from Evidence 5, \"Frame Finger Marks,\" there is potentially incriminating evidence (finger marks) at the crime scene. This suggests that there is indeed evidence pointing to a specific individual.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 5 (Frame Finger Marks) contradicts Testimony 4 (there would be no evidence pointing to a specific culprit).\n",

However, evidence 0 is the Prosecutor's Badge, which would typically belong to Mr. Edgeworth, and no other evidence here indicates any wrongdoing by him. The testimonies by Teneiro appear to be accusatory without physical proof, which contradicts the factual evidence that would be represented by the badge.\n\nHowever, the most direct contradiction lies between testimony 3, where Teneiro states she saw \"you, standing there, with fresh blood dripping off of the murder weapon,\" and evidence 13, the Autopsy Report, which would contain the forensic results about the murder weapon and the blood. If the autopsy report does not confirm the presence of fresh blood or the involvement of the murder weapon as described by Teneiro, then these two pieces would directly contradict each other.\n\nGiven the provided information, the pair best fitting a contradiction is Evidence 13 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 3 (Teneiro's claim of seeing the killer with fresh blood on the weapon).\n",

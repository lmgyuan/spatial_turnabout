    "cot": "The contradiction lies between \"Evidence 4: Maya's Memo\" and \"Testimony 2: On it, the word 'Maya' was written clearly in blood!\" and \"Testimony 3: Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\". If the blood on the paper is confirmed to be the victim's (Mia's), and the memo is titled as Maya's, a contradiction arises regarding whose memo it actually is and the blood's association with the memo. However, since the task requires only one pair, the strongest contradiction is between the memo being Maya's (Evidence 4) but the blood on it being that of the victim (Testimony 3). This implies the memo might not belong to Maya, conflicting with the label on the evidence.\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 1 states that the victim dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. Testimony 2 then mentions that the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her. However, Testimony 3 says the girl hit the victim with the weapon. \n\nLooking at the evidence, Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) could be significant. If the victim ran off to the right after dodging the attack, there would be glass shards in the direction she ran, possibly implying she broke through something or was injured near glass. If April's testimony about the victims' movement contradicts the location or presence of glass shards found at the scene, this could be a contradiction.\n\nSince there is no detailed explicit contradiction among testimonies themselves, the key contradiction is between testimony describing the victim's movement and the presence of glass shards that might indicate the victim did not run far or in that direction.\n\nThus, the evidence (Glass Shards) and testimony (3) contradict each other because the glass shards may not support the victim being hit as testified, or the victim's movement after being hit.\n",

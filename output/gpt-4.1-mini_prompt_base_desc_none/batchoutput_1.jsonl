However, since we only need to find one pair and there is no direct indication about the footage contradicting these testimonies in the provided data, let's look for a clearer pair.\n\nTestimonies 0 to 4 are all from Sahwit, describing his actions in sequence. There's no direct contradiction in these testimonies themselves.\n\nNow, consider the Pocket Chess Set (Evidence 3) and Dog Chess Piece (Evidence 11) along with Testimony 0 where Sahwit says he was in the workroom practicing his skills. If the chess pieces were found in Mr. Knight's room (Evidence 2: Mr. Knight's Body) or somewhere else, it might contradict testimony that Sahwit was practicing chess skills in the workroom. Yet, this is a stretch as the pocket chess set could be anywhere.\n\nLooking at Evidence 7 Door Sensor and Sahwit's testimony that he peeked through the small window on the door (Testimonies 1 and 2). If the Door Sensor shows that the door was never opened or used at that time, this could contradict Sahwit's claim of peeking through the door.\n\nSince a door sensor would detect opening or usage and Sahwit says he peeked through a small window (which doesn't require door opening), the door might not have opened but he could still have peeked.\n\nAlternatively, consider Evidence 20 Autopsy Report which might state the time of death. If it contradicts Sahwit's claim of when he found the body (Testimony 3: \"Then I saw him lying there... dead!\") by showing the victim died earlier or later than Sahwit claims, that would be a direct contradiction.\n\nGiven the data, the clearest contradiction is between \"Testimony 3: Then I saw him lying there... A man... not moving... dead!\" by Sahwit, and potentially the \"Autopsy Report\" (Evidence 20), which might indicate the time of death does not match Sahwit's claim of discovering the body.\n\nTherefore, these two are a likely contradicting pair.\n\n{\"evidence\": 20, \"testimony\": 3}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 632, "completion_tokens": 499, "total_tokens": 1131, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

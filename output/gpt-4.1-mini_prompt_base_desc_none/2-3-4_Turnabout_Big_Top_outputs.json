You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Evidence 15 is the \"Max G. Bust.\" Testimony 2 by Acro says, \"However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible,\" indicating that Acro claims he could not have lifted the bust due to his injuries. However, Testimony 0 says, \"I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust,\" indicating he believes he could lift a bust of that size. These two testimonies contradict each other in regard to the ability to lift the bust.\n\nSince we are asked for one pair consisting of an evidence and a testimony that contradict each other, and testimonies 0 and 2 contradict each other, the pair with Evidence 15 (Max G. Bust) and one testimony which states inability to lift it (Testimony 2) contradict each other.\n\nHence, the contradictory pair is Evidence 15 (Max G. Bust) and Testimony 2.\n",

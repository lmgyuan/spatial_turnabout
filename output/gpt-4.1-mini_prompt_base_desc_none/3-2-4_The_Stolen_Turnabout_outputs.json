    "cot": "The contradiction lies between Testimony 2 and Evidence 10. Testimony 2 claims that Kane Bullard wrote the blackmail letter sent to Ron DeLite. However, without further evidence directly linking Kane Bullard to the blackmail letter, Evidence 10 (the blackmail letter) does not confirm Kane as the author. If other evidence suggests otherwise or the letter indicates a different origin, then these two pieces contradict. But given the available data, the most explicit contradiction is that the testimony assigns authorship on the blackmail letter, whereas the letter itself as evidence does not prove this claim firmly.\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 5 by Andistan'dhin claims that before the blackout, only Ahlbi went to the treasure room other than Rohl. However, if we examine Evidence 12, the Treasure Box, it should have some indication or evidence (such as fingerprints, signs of use, or disturbance) that could conflict with Andistan'dhin's claim if someone else had accessed it. If the Treasure Box evidence clearly shows signs that someone other than Ahlbi or Rohl accessed it, it would contradict the testimony.\n\nSince the prompt does not provide detailed content of evidences, the most logical contradiction is between the testimony that only Ahlbi accessed the treasure room before the blackout (Testimony 5) and the physical evidence represented by the Treasure Box (Evidence 12).\n",

De Rousseau says they kept him at the hideout without harm. \n\nIf we consider Testimony 2 (\"We took the man's identification from him and shut-a him in the room next to ours!\") contradicting with Evidence 21 \"Passport\" because if the passport was presented as evidence indicating the man retained possession, then De Rossi's claim of taking it would be false.

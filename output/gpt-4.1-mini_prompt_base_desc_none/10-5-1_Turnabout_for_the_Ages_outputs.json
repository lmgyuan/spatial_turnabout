However, if Evidence 5 (Crime Scene Notes → President Wang's Autopsy Report) indicates that the cause or circumstances of death do not align with a fall or push from the roof (for instance, if it suggests a different cause of death), then these two would contradict.\n\nWithout specific content of the autopsy report, the contradiction would be between testimony that states the president was pushed off the roof (Testimony 1) and an autopsy report (Evidence 5) that presumably might suggest another cause or details inconsistent with being pushed off.\n\nTherefore, the likely contradiction is between Evidence 5 and Testimony 1.\n",

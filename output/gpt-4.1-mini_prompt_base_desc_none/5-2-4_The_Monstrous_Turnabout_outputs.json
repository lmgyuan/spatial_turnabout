This implies that the item (staff) was stolen by Tenma Taro.\n\nHowever, Testimony 1 and Testimony 2 mention Tenma Taro as a 'little thing' and that she carried a big staff, seen when she came into the foyer, implying possession rather than theft reputed in Testimony 3.\n\nBut since the only evidence linked here is Evidence 2, which is the Tenma Taro Warding Charm, it may be linked or has some indication that contradicts the idea that Tenma Taro stole the staff.

No, those can be compatible.\n\nTestimony 4 says: \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\"  \n\nEvidence 8, Golden Fur, presumably from the scene and present already.\n\nIf the tracks and feathers weren't there before, but evidence shows the fur was there before, that could be a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, L'Belle claims the Forbidden Chamber was locked until the mayor opened it (testimony 5), but evidence 6, \"Foyer Diagram,\" or evidence 7, \"Fox and Demon Statue,\" which had fallen to the floor (testimony 6), might indicate the chamber was tampered with.\n\nSince the testimonies focus a lot on L'Belle's statements, and considering the key conflict:\n\nTestimony 5: Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.  \nTestimony 0/1: L'Belle entered the Fox Chamber after the murder but only after certain events.\n\nIf evidence 17, Forbidden Chamber Key, is found in L'Belle's possession or somewhere indicating unauthorized access, it could contradict testimony 5.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction pair is:\n\nEvidence 17 (Forbidden Chamber Key) and Testimony 5 (\"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\")\n\nExplanation: If the key was accessible to someone else or the chamber was accessible without the mayor's opening, testimony 5 would be false.\n",

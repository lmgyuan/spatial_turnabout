Typically, a passport is used for international travel and identity verification. If the passport evidence indicates the defendant was elsewhere at the time (for example, if it has a timestamp or location that conflicts with Sahwit's account), this would directly contradict Sahwit's testimony about seeing the defendant flee.\n\nHowever, among the testimonies provided, none explicitly mention the passport or travel, so the main contradiction is with the alibi or timeline connected to the passport evidence.\n\nSince we're to provide one pair clearly contradicting each other from the current evidence and testimonies, another strong contradiction is:\n\nSahwit's Testimony 6 states: \"However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\"\n\nIf the evidences include a \"Blackout Record\" (Evidence 4), which might suggest a power outage or blackout in the building, it would affect the phone service. But if evidence shows there was no blackout at the time, then Testimony 6 contradicts the Blackout Record. However, the testimony suggests the phone wasn't working, not necessarily due to a blackout.\n\nGiven the above, the strongest contradiction is between:\n\nTestimony 9: \"The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.\"\n\nAnd the Passport evidence (Evidence 3), which might prove the defendant was not at the scene.\n\nHence,\n",

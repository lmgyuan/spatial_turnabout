    "cot": "The testimonies from Iris claim that Mystic Elise struck Mystic Maya with her staff, then threw the staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe. However, Evidence 9 is the Victim's Staff. If the staff was thrown away and then used to strike, it would be contradictory if the staff evidence shows no such use or does not match the testimony's claim of it being the weapon used in the striking. More specifically, testimony 3 says: \"She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!\" which implies the staff was discarded before the dagger was used, yet testimony 2 says \"While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!\" which suggests the staff was used to deliver a fatal strike, conflicting with testimony 3.\n\nThus, testimony 2 and testimony 3 contradict each other, but the pair asked is between evidence and testimony, so we should find something in evidence contradicting a testimony.\n\nLooking at the Weather Data (Evidence 7) and the crime scene or timeline testimonies could be possible, but no clear contradiction is given here.\n\nAnother possible contradiction is Iris's testimony 0 \"I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.\" vs evidence like Hazakura Temple Map (Evidence 3) or Dusky Bridge Photo (Evidence 21). If the garden is in the Inner Temple, but the map shows differently, it may contradict.\n\nThe strongest direct factual contradiction is between Iris's multiple testimonies about Elise attacking Maya with her staff and then a dagger, while the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) may indicate the cause of death being inconsistent with those weapons.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that Evidence 11 \"Elise's Autopsy Report\" contradicts Iris's testimony 1 \"I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!\" because if Elise is the victim with an autopsy report stating cause of death inconsistent with being an attacker, that would contradict the assertion that Elise was attacking Maya.\n\nHowever, Iris's testimony explicitly states Elise attacked Maya, but the autopsy report of Elise suggests she is the victim. This is a contradiction between evidence 11 and testimony 1.\n",

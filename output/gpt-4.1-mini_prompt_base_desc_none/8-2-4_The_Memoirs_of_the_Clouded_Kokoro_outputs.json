However, Testimony 1 states, \"'Twas in my cup alone that the wicked miscreant secretly pour'd his wicked poison,\" implying that the poison was specifically in \"my cup\" and not the soap.\n\nThe contradiction lies in the implication of where the poison was. Testimony 4 suggests the soap is safe and does not contain poison, while Testimony 1 specifies poison was only in a cup, not in the soap.

    "cot": "Testimony 0 states that Green was walking alone in the snow when she was stabbed in the back six days ago at about 5 p.m. Testimony 4, however, states that Green was admitted straight to the hospital and \"knew nothing about all of this business,\" which implies she was unaware or uninvolved in later events that her other testimonies reference. This does not directly contradict evidence but rather explains her limited knowledge.\n\nLooking at the evidences, Evidence 14 is \"Miss Green's Card,\" which presumably has her address or contact information. Testimony 5 says that a note was delivered to Green at her address and that it is unrelated to the \"odd man next to me here.\" This seems to show she received a note at the address on the card, which matches.\n\nTestimony 1 says the stabbing occurred just outside the house where the men in this case have their lodgings, but Testimony 3 says this was the first time Green was in the area. If the house is where the men live, and the stabbing was just outside, but Green had never been in the area before, this may be contradictory.\n\nEvidence 2 is \"Nearby Street Map,\" which presumably shows locations and their proximities.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- Testimony 1 (Green): The stabbing happened just outside the house where the men in this case live.\n\n- Testimony 3 (Green): It was the first time I had been in the area.\n\nIf the stabbing happened just outside the men's lodging, but Green had never been to the area before, this is contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the contradictory pair is:\n\nEvidence 2 (Nearby Street Map) indicating the location in question, and Testimony 3 (Green) stating it was the first time she had been in the area.\n\nBut the instruction is to name one evidence and one testimony that contradict each other.\n\nAlternatively, another more direct contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Testimony 4, both from Green.\n\nTestimony 0 says she was stabbed in the back six days ago at about 5 p.m. while walking along in the snow—so she was outside.\n\nTestimony 4 says she was admitted straight to hospital and knew nothing about all this business.\n\nIt's not a direct contradiction if she was stabbed and admitted to the hospital.\n\nIs there an evidence that contradicts any testimony?\n\nEvidence 5: Bar of Soap – likely irrelevant.\n\nEvidence 12: Bottle of Poison might relate to a poisoning.\n\nEvidence 7: Victim's Medical Report maybe relates to the stabbing?\n\nIf the medical report says the stabbing occurred at a different time or different circumstances than described in Testimony 0, then we have a contradiction.\n\nBut since the text of the medical report is not given, this is unknown.\n\nGiven all of this, the best fitting contradiction is between Testimony 1 and 3 from Green, and Evidence 2.\n\nBecause Testimony 1 says stabbing happened just outside men's lodgings.\n\nTestimony 3 says it was first time she'd been in area (implying she didn't know about nearby lodgings).\n\nEvidence 2 is a street map that could confirm the proximity and contradict her \"first time in area\" statement.\n\nTherefore,\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 4 states by Green, \"I can point out the villain here! And as for that torn-off piece of the envelope, I don't know anything about it.\" This suggests Green claims ignorance about the torn-off piece of the envelope (Evidence 4). However, Testimony 3 has Green saying, \"I don't know what you mean. You think I snuck into this man's room, do you? Why would I?\" This reflects defensiveness about being accused of sneaking into the man's room but does not necessarily deny knowledge about the envelope.\n\nBetween these testimonies and the evidence, there is no direct contradiction except Green’s denial of knowledge about the torn envelope against the existence of the evidence (torn-off end of envelope). The denials about sneaking into the room are slightly different points.\n\nHowever, looking at Testimony 0, 1, and 2 by Shamspeare about a vanished note: He remembers receiving a note a week ago, stayed a long hour at the Slug and Salad matching the note's instructions but no one came, and later saw the note had vanished. This is consistent internally but does not contradict evidence.\n\nTherefore, the direct contradiction lies between Green’s denial of the torn-off piece of the envelope (Testimony 4) and the fact of the torn-off envelope piece as evidence (Evidence 4).\n",

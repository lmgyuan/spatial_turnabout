    "cot": "The evidence \"Maya's Magatama\" (Evidence 2) is a mystical item often used by Maya for spiritual and investigative purposes, and there is no indication that it would be bloodied or used directly in an attack. Testimony 2 by Gumshoe states that the costume (Evidence 11) was covered in blood, implying that the defendant was directly involved in the attack. This could contradict the presence or condition of other pieces of evidence, such as the Magatama, if it shows no signs of misuse or blood. However, this is somewhat indirect.\n\nA more direct contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Testimony 2 from Gumshoe about the costume (Evidence 11). Testimony 1 states that the defendant was wearing the costume at the time of the crime, but if the costume is not bloody or inconsistent with being the outfit worn, that would contradict Testimony 2 that claims the costume is covered in blood.\n\nGiven only one evidence and one testimony to choose from, the best contradiction is between Gumshoe's statement that the defendant wore a costume (Evidence 11) at the time of the crime but the costume is clean (implied by its condition in the evidence) while Gumshoe claims it is covered in blood.\n\nThus, the evidence (Maya's Costume, Evidence 11) and Testimony 2 (\"As you can see, it's covered in blood.\") contradict each other.\n",

    "cot": "The contradiction lies between Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) and Testimony 8. Cody states in Testimony 8 that he did not have his camera with him at the time of seeing the Steel Samurai and the bad guy, which would have been the perfect moment to take a photo. However, the existence of Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) implies he had a camera. This inconsistency between having the camera as evidence and claiming in the testimony that he did not have it at that moment presents a contradiction.\n",

    "cot": "The evidence titled \"Cody's Camera\" suggests the presence of a camera that presumably contains some photographs or evidence. However, Cody's testimony (Testimony 5) claims that he took a few shots but erased them because it was too late. This contradicts Testimony 2 and Testimony 3, where Cody talks about attempting to take a picture, but missing it due to the lens not opening in time.\n\nThe specific contradiction lies between evidence indicating the existence of Cody's Camera (implying photographic evidence) and Cody's testimony that he erased the photos, meaning no photographs should remain.\n\nTherefore, the pair that most directly contradicts each other is Evidence 15 (\"Cody's Camera\") and Testimony 5 (\"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\").\n",

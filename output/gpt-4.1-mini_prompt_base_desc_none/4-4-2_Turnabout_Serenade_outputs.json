However, testimony 5 says, \"I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...\" This shows inconsistency in what Lamiroir claims to have seen. But since we need to pick one contradiction between evidence and testimony, the autopsy report (Evidence 8) and Lamiroir's claim of seeing nothing (Testimony 0) contradict each other because the autopsy confirms the body and cause of death, whereas Lamiroir claims to have seen nothing.\n",

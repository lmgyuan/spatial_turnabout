However, Testimony 2 states that before Uendo discovered the body, the only person who had gone into the dressing room was Bucky. If the door was wide open and Geiru was watching, it would be unlikely that someone else, like Bucky, could enter or be the only person who went in.\n\nThis raises a contradiction between the idea that the door was wide open and that only Bucky had gone in before the body was found.\n\nNo direct evidence explicitly contradicts the testimonies, but the testimonies themselves contradict each other.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between testimonies 2 and 4.\n\nHowever, you asked for one evidence and one testimony that contradict each other.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n\n- Evidence 8 is \"Taifu's Note\" and might relate to information about timing or access.\n- Evidence 1 is \"Backstage Diagram,\" which might contradict someone's claim about positions or awareness in the area.\n\nGiven the information at hand, the clearest contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Testimony 4, so perhaps the better choice is to pair one of these testimonies with an evidence that supports or contradicts the claim.\n\nSince no evidence directly contradicts the testimonies, let's pick the best pair that involves an evidence and testimony.\n\nTestimony 2: \"...the only person who had gone in there was Bucky.\"\n\nTestimony 4: \"I was in the yard, but the door was wide open, so I could keep watch on the dressing room.\"\n\nIf Evidence 1 \"Backstage Diagram\" shows that the yard is not visible from the dressing room door or that the door was not open, it would contradict Testimony 4.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction could be between Evidence 1 (Backstage Diagram) and Testimony 4.\n\nHence, the pair is:\n",

If Uendo's testimonies claim that the dying message left by Shisho was about Bucky, but Simon's statement (Evidence 6) contradicts this interpretation or presents a different view of the message, then the contradiction exists between Evidence 6 and one of Uendo's testimonies referring to the dying message.\n\nLooking at Uendo's Testimony 3: \"Anyway, I got the meaning right away.

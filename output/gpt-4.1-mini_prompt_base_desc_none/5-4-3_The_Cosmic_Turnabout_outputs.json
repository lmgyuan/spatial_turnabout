    "cot": "Testimony 3 states that the standing figure in the lounge \"must have been Starbuck.\" However, Testimony 4 says that Detective Arme fired two warning shots at the figure. If the figure was Starbuck and Arme was firing warning shots, it suggests there was some confrontation or suspicion. But examining the evidences, specifically Evidence 15, the \"Bullet from Arme's Gun,\" if this bullet matches the single bullet found in Evidence 12 \"Bullet\" or the \"Bullet Hole\" in Evidence 10, it could either confirm or deny the presence and actions taken.\n\nHowever, since no direct contradiction is noted between these testimonies and the evidence given here, the main contradiction must be between the description of the figure and who it was.\n\nTestimony 3 assumes the standing figure was Starbuck, but other testimonies or evidences (not given here) might suggest otherwise.\n\nGiven that, the pair that presents a contradiction is:\n\nTestimony 3: \"I hate to say it, but I can only imagine the standing figure mast have been Starbuck.\"\n\nvs.\n\nTestimony 4: \"Detective Arme fired two warning shots at the figure.\"\n\nActually, these two testimonies are compatible.\n\nLet me look at Testimony 0-2:\n\nTestimony 0: Detective Arme and I rushed towards boarding lounge together.\n\nTestimony 1: We went via Control Room and peeked in from there to see what was going on inside.\n\nTestimony 2: We saw a figure standing in the middle of the lounge, and Terran lying on the floor.\n\nTestimony 3: The standing figure must have been Starbuck.\n\nTestimony 4: Detective Arme fired two warning shots at the figure.\n\nNow, is there any evidence that contradicts that?\n\nEvidence 7 is \"Security Camera Video,\" which could have recorded who the standing figure was.\n\nIf the Security Camera Video shows that the figure was not Starbuck but someone else, then Evidence 7 contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nIn summary, if the Security Camera Video (Evidence 7) shows the standing figure was not Starbuck, then the testimony that \"the standing figure must have been Starbuck\" (Testimony 3) contradicts that.\n\nTherefore, the pair is:\n\nEvidence 7: Security Camera Video\n\nTestimony 3: \"I hate to say it, but I can only imagine the standing figure mast have been Starbuck.\"\n",

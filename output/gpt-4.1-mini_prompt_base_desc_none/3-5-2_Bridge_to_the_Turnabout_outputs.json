    "cot": "Evidence 0 is the \"Attorney's Badge\" which indicates that the person is a practicing attorney. Testimony 0 by Bikini says \"I saw the murder at around 11 PM...\" If the badge shown or possessed by the person is of the lawyer who was supposed to be elsewhere or had an alibi conflicting with witnessing the murder at 11 PM, this can be a contradiction.\n\nHowever, focusing on the list, a more clear contradiction is between Evidence 14: \"Tracks Photo\" and Testimony 3: Bikini says \"It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\".\n\nIf the Tracks Photo shows no snowmobile tracks or no indication of fast travel, but only foot tracks, then Testimony 3 would be contradicted by Evidence 14.\n\nBut since the Tracks Photo is about tracks indicating snowmobile use (Testimony 2), that supports the testimony.\n\nAnother contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Testimony 5: \"Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\" (Testimony 4 by Bikini), and \"Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...\" (Testimony 5 by Bikini).\n\nNo contradiction there; both support the idea that the weapon was thrown and Iris drove the snowmobile.\n\nGiven the evidences and testimonies, the clearest contradiction is between the \"Note to Iris\" (Evidence 8) and the statement of Bikini seeing the snowmobile tracks (Testimony 2).\n\nIf the Note to Iris says something indicating Iris could not have left or driven the snowmobile, but Bikini testifies that Iris can drive the snowmobile and thus could have done it (Testimony 5), that might be a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between the \"Weather Data\" (Evidence 7) and the \"Tracks Photo\" (Evidence 14). If the Weather Data shows heavy snowfall making tracks impossible or hard to find but the Tracks Photo clearly shows tracks, then that is a contradiction.\n\nBetween all these, the most straightforward contradiction is between the \"Note to Iris\" (Evidence 8) and Bikini's testimony #5 that \"Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...\"\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is:\n\nEvidence 8 contradicts Testimony 5.\n",

If Mr. Smith has \"three aces\" and Mr. Wright has \"two aces,\" that would be five aces total. But a standard deck has only four aces (Testimony 1 confirms this).\n\nSo Testimony 3 implies an impossible situation with the card count, which conflicts with Testimony 1. However, the prompt asks for contradictions between evidences and testimonies.\n\nLet's check the evidences related to hands: Evidence 8 (Wright's Hand) and Evidence 9 (Victim's Hand).\n\nIf Evidence 9 (Victim's Hand) shows three aces and Evidence 8 (Wright's Hand) shows two aces, that matches Testimony 3.\n\nBut because a deck cannot have five aces, this is impossible and contradicts Evidence 1 (Smith's Autopsy Report) or other evidences? No direct contradiction.\n\nLet's look at Evidence 1 (Smith's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 5: \"He took bottle in his hand... Poor Mr. Smith!\"\n\nEvidence 3 is the Deadly Bottle, which is presumably the weapon.\n\nIf the autopsy report (Evidence 1) states that Mr. Smith had nothing in his hand at death, this contradicts Testimony 5.\n\nSince we don't have the details of the evidence contents, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 2 and 7 are crime photos and could contradict Testimony 5.\n\nBecause the prompt demands only one pair of contradiction between evidence and testimony, the strongest contradiction emerges between Evidence 1 (Smith's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 5 regarding the bottle being held.\n\nIf the autopsy report says Mr. Smith's hand was empty or no bottle, then Olga's statement that \"He took bottle in his hand\" contradicts that.\n\nHence, the contradictory pair is Evidence 1 and Testimony 5.\n",

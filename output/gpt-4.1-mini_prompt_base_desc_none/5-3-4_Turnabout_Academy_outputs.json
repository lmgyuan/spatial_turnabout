Testimony 1 states that Aristotle Means was supposed to pre-record his speech for the mock trial and be in the audio room, implying that he was not physically present during the actual speech which might affect his alibi. However, Voiceprint Analysis (Evidence 19) can be used to verify whether the speech was indeed a pre-recording or spoken live.

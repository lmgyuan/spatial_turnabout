    "cot": "Moe claims in all his testimonies that he saw Max wearing a silk hat, a black cloak, and carrying certain items. However, the \"Silk Hat\" evidence (Evidence 3) would be a physical item presumably worn at the crime scene or related location. If the silk hat was physically found or accounted for separately and it doesn't match Max's size or other attributes, this could contradict Moe's testimony about Max wearing it.\n\nMost importantly, Moe talks about a cloak fluttering in the wind, which obscured what's being carried. If there's evidence that definitively shows Max wasn't wearing such a cloak (e.g., the Ringmaster's Papers or Max's Promo Poster showing no cloak), Moe's claim about the cloak would be contradicted by evidence.\n\nBut the strongest contradiction is between Moe's repeated mention of the silk hat and presence of a \"Silk Hat\" evidence which may show it belonged to someone else or was found elsewhere.\n\nThus, the pair between Evidence 3 (Silk Hat) and Testimony 2 (\"His silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!\") is a clear contradiction candidate.\n",

    "cot": "The contradiction exists between Evidence 1 (Great Exhibition Newspaper) and Testimony 0 (The special exhibit in the House of Horrors is based on a rumour that shocked society in London). If the special exhibit is based on a rumour, the newspaper evidence should confirm such a rumour, but if the newspaper is factual and presents verified information, then it contradicts the idea of the exhibit being based merely on a rumour.\n\nHowever, since the testimonies provided mostly relate to Tusspells' work with the corpse and the House of Horrors exhibit, the better contradiction lies more specifically within the testimonies from Tusspells about the timing and method of creating the mould of the head. \n\nTestimony 2 states: \"I enlisted the aid of the gravedigger, and created a mould for the head in the cemetery just before the interment.\"  \nTestimony 6 states: \"I hurried to finish my work in the half hour before sunrise. Then I left as soon as the corpse was interred.\"\n\nThese two messages contradict each other since testimony 2 says \"just before the interment\" meaning while the corpse was still above ground and ready to be buried, and testimony 6 says \"then I left as soon as the corpse was interred,\" implying the work was finished after interment. But these two are consistent; so, perhaps there's another.\n\nLook at Testimony 4: \"It took me a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis.\"  \nTestimony 3: \"I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night.\"\n\nThese don't necessarily contradict.\n\nOne significant contradiction could be found between Evidence 6 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4 (It took me a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis). If the autopsy report states rigor mortis had already set in, Tusspells' testimony that she worked before rigor mortis contradicts it.\n\nTherefore, the pair is:\n\n- Evidence 6 (Autopsy Report)  \n- Testimony 4 (It took me a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis).\n",

    "cot": "Evidence 1 is the Great Exhibition Newspaper which presumably contains an article with an illustration of what happened during an event. Testimony 4 from Drebber states: \"There was no gunshot from behind me at all.

The newspaper article might have sensationalized or incorrectly portrayed the incident.\n\nThus, the contradiction lies between the newspaper article's illustration (Evidence 1) and Drebber's testimony denying the gunshot and blood splatter (Testimony 4).\n",

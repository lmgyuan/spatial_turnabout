Testimony 4 mentions that thirty minutes later, Atmey used an emergency phone to notify the police. If Atmey was knocked unconscious at 1:00 AM and only notified the police thirty minutes later, it suggests that value of timing and the sequence of events.\n\nTo find a contradiction, we look for evidence that conflicts with this timeline. Evidence 9, the Security Camera Photo, typically contains a timestamp. If this photo shows that police were already notified or arrived well before 1:30 AM, or the timing contradicts the timeline given by Atmey, then the security camera photo and testimony 4 contradict each other.\n\nHowever, since the content or timestamps of evidence 9 is not provided, we have to infer based on the given data.\n\nWithin the testimonies provided, Atmey mentions the sequence consistently: arrival at 1:00 AM, being struck, knocked out, then notified police 30 minutes later. There is no direct contradiction in his own statements.\n\nNone of the other evidence details about time is given, only the names. But an evidence that would contradict a testimony about time should have timestamp or proof of a different time.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction most likely lies between Testimony 0 and Evidence 9 (Security Camera Photo), assuming the photo timestamp shows a different time of the incident or police arrival.\n\nHence, the pair is evidence 9 and testimony 0.\n",

These two testimonies contradict each other, but they do not involve evidence directly.\n\nLooking at the evidences and testimonies, the only evidence that might be connected to Atmey's statements about being attacked and rendered senseless is a weapon-related evidence or something related to the fight, though none of the evidences explicitly mention a weapon taken by the thief.\n\nGiven the specifics, Testimony 0 (\"I looked away from the door for a brief moment\") conflicts with Testimony 1 (\"Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\")—both are from Atmey and show contradictory descriptions of his attentiveness.\n\nSince no evidence explicitly contradicts these statements, the contradiction is primarily within the testimonies themselves.\n\nTherefore, the pair of contradictory evidence and testimony cannot be found except in the testimonies themselves.\n\nGiven the constraints to provide one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, the best fitting would be:\n\nEvidence 9: Security Camera Photo — If the security camera photo shows Atmey looking directly at the door or otherwise not looking away, it would contradict Testimony 0 where Atmey admits he looked away from the door.\n\nTherefore, assuming Evidence 9 shows Atmey looking directly at the door (contradicting his claim of looking away), the contradiction pair is between Evidence 9 and Testimony 0.\n",

Yet, testimony 5 states that Ron says he snagged the broach on the door handle and it got torn off, implying that he has a broach (evidence 14: DeMasque's Broach) but this broach got torn off unintentionally, suggesting he may not be fully Mask☆DeMasque or that the broach is separate from his costume or calling card.\n\nMore directly contradictory is testimony 2, where Ron says he doesn't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, implying he had the opportunity. But the evidence 9 is a security camera photo that shows Ron at a different location that night, shown in testimony 4 where Ron points to himself in the photo. So testimony 2 (no alibi) contradicts evidence 9 (security camera photo) and testimony 4 (showing he was elsewhere).\n\nTherefore, the most direct contradiction pair is the security camera photo (evidence 9) versus testimony 2.\n",

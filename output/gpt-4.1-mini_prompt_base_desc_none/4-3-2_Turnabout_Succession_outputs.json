However, the piece of evidence named \"Gramarye Envelope\" (Evidence 2) could either confirm or contradict this testimony depending on whether it matches the description and context provided by Brushel.\n\nHowever, Testimony 3 (\"I thought nothing of it at the time, of course.\") seems to be neutral and does not provide any contradictory information by itself.\n\nTestimony 4 (\"Now that I think about it, what if he was writing a suicide note!?\") introduces a theory that might be contradicted by certain evidence, depending on its content. \n\nConsidering the evidences for contradictions:\n\n- The \"Hidden Painting\" (Evidence 8) and \"Portrait\" (Evidence 4) do not relate directly to a letter.\n- The \"Red Envelope\" (Evidence 9) differs by color from the yellow envelope described by Brushel.\n- \"Letter from Misham\" (Evidence 31) would be directly related to the letter mentioned by Brushel.\n- \"Gramarye Envelope\" (Evidence 2) matches the description of the envelope being sealed.\n\nThe contradiction can be seen between the color or presence of an envelope and the testimonies. Brushel specifically mentions a yellow envelope.\n\nIf the Red Envelope (Evidence 9) is identified as the envelope left at the crime scene, it would contradict Brushel's testimony stating it was a yellow envelope.\n\nTherefore, the pair that contradicts each other is:\n\nEvidence 9 (Red Envelope) contradicts Testimony 2 (It was a yellow envelope. ...I heard it was left at the crime scene.)\n",

    "cot": "Evidence 2 is a photo of \"My Father.\" Testimony 3 states that \"And lying right in front of me was Inga, dead as a doornail.\" The photo of \"My Father\" should depict Dhurke's father, not Inga. If the photo of Dhurke's father was used to confirm identity or events related to Inga's death at the tomb, that could be a contradiction—perhaps implying mistaken identity or incorrect evidence being used.\n\nHowever, this is a weak contradiction. Let's check another pair.\n\nTestimonies 1 and 2 from Dhurke contradict each other:\n- Testimony 1: \"The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand.\" (Implies Dhurke was present at the crime scene holding the knife)\n- Testimony 2: \"The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.\" (Implies only Dhurke was there)\n\nThis suggests Dhurke is the killer, but Testimony 6: \"But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.\" and Testimony 7: \"Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either...\" show he is unsure or denying the killing despite the evidence.\n\nLooking at Evidence 29, Dhurke's Corpse Photo, seeing Dhurke dead conflicts with his own testimonies in present tense and being at the murder scene. If Dhurke is shown dead but also giving eyewitness testimonies about the event, that is contradictory.\n\nThus, there is a contradiction between Evidence 29 (Dhurke's Corpse Photo) and Dhurke's testimonies 0-7 where he describes the event as if alive and recounting the incident.\n\nSo one pair contradiction is:\n\nEvidence 29 (Dhurke's Corpse Photo) and Testimony 0 (Dhurke: \"I was struck by a sudden dizziness the moment I entered the tomb.\") – as Dhurke is talking after the murder but is shown dead.\n\nTherefore, this is a clear contradiction.\n",

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Testimony 1 states: \"It was I who murdered Justice Minister Inga.\" This is a direct confession by Nahyuta to the murder of Justice Minister Inga.\n\nEvidence 15 is \"Inga's Autopsy Report.\" Typically, an autopsy report would provide important details about how and when the victim died.\n\nIf the details in the autopsy report contradict Nahyuta's confession (for example, if the autopsy shows a cause of death or time of death that does not align with Nahyuta's claim), then these two pieces would contradict each other.\n\nWithout the specific contents, the most direct contradiction would be between the confession (Testimony 1) and the autopsy report (Evidence 15), as a confession should match the forensic evidence.\n\nTherefore, the pair that likely contradict each other is Evidence 15 (Inga's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 1 (Nahyuta's confession to murder).\n",

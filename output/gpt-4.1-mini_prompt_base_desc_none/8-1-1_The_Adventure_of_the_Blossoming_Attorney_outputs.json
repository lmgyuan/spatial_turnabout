That young girl was astride the Englishwoman, dagger in hand, as she stabbed wildly!\" This claim asserts that the young girl was stabbing the victim.\n\nTestimony 1 is also from Soseki: \"I'd just managed to catch that crab when I suddenly heard a caterwaul from behind me.\" This suggests Soseki was catching a crab and then heard a scream, but does not mention witnessing the stabbing directly.\n\nTestimony 4 by Hosonaga says: \"I saw blood on the blade. It proved to me that she'd stabbed the victim multiple times.\" This supports the stabbing claim.\n\nTestimony 0: \"On the day of the incident, I was ordered on a special surveillance assignment in this disguise.\" This suggests Hosonaga was undercover elsewhere.\n\nTestimony 2: \"I ran into the beach hut at once, where I found the pair in question.\" Again from Hosonaga.\n\nIf the Post-Mortem Report (Evidence 0) indicates no stabbing wounds, or the Crime Scene Photograph (Evidence 1) shows no blood or signs of stabbing, that would contradict the testimonies that say the victim was stabbed multiple times.\n\nSince the instructions are to pick just one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, and the most direct contradiction would be between the Post-Mortem Report (Evidence 0) and Testimony 3 (Soseki's claim of stabbing), I will choose these two.\n",

But Testimony 3 says: \"The only exit from the storeroom is the hatch that leads to the viewing platform,\" implying access.\n\nIf the evidence or other testimony claims something else about the red raincoat's location or possession, that would contradict.\n\nGiven limited info, the best contradiction pair seems to be Evidence 22 Red Raincoat (which is an item that Ms. Crane is said to have won) and Testimony 4 (Ms. Crane went out to the viewing platform where she was attacked by Kay Faraday)—the presence of the red raincoat on Ms. Crane being contested.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Testimony 1 and Evidence 22 do not contradict.\n\nI need to find one pair that clearly contradicts.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 4 says Ms. Crane was attacked on the viewing platform by Kay Faraday.\n\nGravelle states all five testimonies.\n\nBut Evidence 8 is \"Kay's Recollections,\" which may contradict the testimonies given by Gravelle.\n\nIf Kay's recollections state that she did not attack Ms. Crane at the viewing platform, it would contradict Testimony 4.\n\nSince no direct quotes from Evidence 8 are given, I cannot confirm.\n\nAnother contradiction may be between Testimony 0: Ms. Crane went to the black market auction as a customer, and perhaps from other evidence suggesting Ms. Crane came to the auction as an infiltrator or seller.\n\nBut again, no direct conflict is shown.\n\nLooking further, Testimony 4 (Ms. Crane was attacked at the viewing platform by Kay Faraday), but if Evidence 10 (Keycard) and Evidence 12 (Keycard Record) indicates that Kay Faraday was not anywhere near the viewing platform at the time, then that would be a contradiction.\n\nIf the Keycard Record shows Kay Faraday somewhere else, it contradicts the testimony that Kay attacked Ms. Crane at the viewing platform.\n\nTherefore, if the Keycard Record contradicts Testimony 4, the pair is (Evidence 12, Testimony 4).\n\nGiven no other direct contradiction is apparent, this is the best candidate.\n",

    "cot": "The contradiction can be seen between Evidence 10 (Glowing Costume Photo) and Testimony 4 (Scuttlebutt's claim that the person she saw was wearing the costume Juniper had made). Testimony 4 states that Juniper was wearing the costume she made, indicating a specific and recognizable costume. However, Evidence 10 displays a glowing costume photo, which could suggest a different costume or an altered appearance that might not match what Juniper had originally made. This discrepancy raises doubt about whether the person in the photo is truly Juniper or if the costume is the one Juniper made.\n",

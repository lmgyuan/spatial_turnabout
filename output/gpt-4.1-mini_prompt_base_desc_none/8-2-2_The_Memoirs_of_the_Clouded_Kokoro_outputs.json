After which I went back to my room, at around eleven.\nPerson: Soseki\nTestimony 2\nTestimony: Argh! My tea was completely harmless! He couldn't have locked the door behind me otherwise, could he?\nPerson: Soseki\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: Strychnine takes some time to have an effect on the body. People don't keel over immediately after takin' it.\nPerson: Gregson\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: The victim would have been perfectly able to lock the door after his guest left. The argument still stands.\nPerson: Gregson\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair.

    "cot": "Evidence 6 is the \"Crime Scene Photograph,\" which presumably shows the door being locked after the victim's guest left. Testimony 2 from Soseki states, \"He couldn't have locked the door behind me otherwise, could he?\" implying that the door could not have been locked after he left, suggesting the door remained unlocked. \n\nHowever, Evidence 6 would contradict this, as the photograph could show the door being locked. Additionally, Testimony 4 by Gregson supports the idea that the victim could lock the door after the guest left, which opposes Soseki's claim.\n\nSince I have to provide only one pair, the direct contradiction is between the \"Crime Scene Photograph\" (Evidence 6) and Soseki's statement about the door locking (Testimony 2).\n",

    "cot": "Evidence 8: Gas Meter is the physical item discussed in the testimonies.  \nTestimony 3: Altamont states the meter doesn't appear to have been tampered with and the collection agent has the only key.  \nTestimony 4: Altamont states all joints on the meter are welded shut, and the lock is made from solid steel, making it impossible to dismantle.  \nTestimony 6: Metermann claims someone is using all the gas without paying.\n\nThe contradiction: Metermann claims that someone is using gas without paying (testimony 6), which implies tampering or misuse. However, Altamont claims the meter can't be tampered with (testimony 3 and 4). These testimonies contradict the implication behind the physical evidence of the gas meter's condition.\n\nHowever, the user requests one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict. The Gas Meter evidence hasn't been described as tampered or not. The testimonies contradict each other directly:\n\n- Testimony 3 and 4 say the meter cannot be tampered with or dismantled.  \n- Testimony 6 says someone uses the gas without paying, implying a form of tampering or exploiting the meter.\n\nTherefore, evidence 8 (Gas Meter) with testimony 6 (Metermann's statement) are in contradiction. Because the testimony claims unpaid gas use, but the meter itself cannot be tampered with as per other testimonies.\n",

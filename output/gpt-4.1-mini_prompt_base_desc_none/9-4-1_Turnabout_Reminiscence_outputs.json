    "cot": "Testimony 0 states that there's no one with a motive to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell. However, Testimony 1 suggests that having a grudge against just one of the two men is enough to establish a motive. These two testimonies contradict each other because the first negates any motive for killing both, while the second implies that a motive exists if there was a grudge against either man. Since both are testimonies and the question asks for a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict, let's check the evidence:\n\nEvidence 2: Det. Gumshoe's Testimony  \nEvidence 10: Det. Badd's Testimony  \nThese are testimonies, not evidence.\n\nEvidence 17: Surveillance Video might show what really happened.\n\nSince no direct evidence is paired here that contradicts directly with the testimonies above except the possibility that Evidence 2 or 10 contains different statements, the best direct contradiction is the pair of Testimony 0 (no motive for killing both) and Testimony 3 (that the killing was intentional and set up to look like a mutual killing).\n\nGiven the context, Evidence 2 is Det. Gumshoe's Testimony: assuming this testimony supports the idea that the killings were intentional, it would contradict Testimony 0, which says nobody had a motive.\n\nTherefore, the pair of contradiction would be:\n\nEvidence 2 (Detective Gumshoe's Testimony) and Testimony 0 (Yew's statement about no motive).\n",

If Trucy's Statement (Evidence 9) indicates something contrary, such as Bonny having the opportunity or motive, then these two would contradict.\n\nSince only one pair is requested, and from the given testimonies and evidence titles, a direct contradiction likely appears between Testimony 5 (Bonny claims she was too busy to kill Mr. Reus) and any evidence indicating Bonny's involvement or opportunity.\n\nAssuming that the Clipboard (Evidence 13) or Show Script (Evidence 7) may reveal details about Bonny's schedule or presence that conflict with her testimony.\n\nHowever, the clearest pair to select based on the available list would be:\n\nEvidence 9 (Trucy's Statement) vs Testimony 5 (Bonny's claim of being too busy).\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 3 states that the bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, without any doubt. However, if there is evidence that contradicts this (such as the \"Stage Pistol\" being linked to someone else or evidence that the bullet did not come from it), that would be a direct contradiction. Since \"Stage Pistol\" (Evidence 20) is identified as the weapon and is presumably the pistol found at the scene, if there is other evidence or doubt cast on the pistol being the murder weapon, that would contradict Testimony 3.\n\nBut from the provided list, none of the evidence explicitly states the bullet was from another weapon or contradicts the pistol as the murder weapon. However, Testimony 4 says \"And the pistol definitely belonged to the old man,\" while there might be an item such as the \"Transferal of Rights\" (Evidence 26) or \"Letter from Misham\" (Evidence 31) that could show ownership transfer or dispute ownership, which would contradict Testimony 4.\n\nGiven the data:\n\n- Testimony 4 says the pistol belonged to the old man (likely the victim).\n- If the \"Transferal of Rights\" (Evidence 26) shows that someone else legally owned the pistol or had rights to it, this would contradict Testimony 4.\n\nTherefore, the pair is Evidence 26 and Testimony 4.\n",

If the Blue Badgermobile is specifically associated with a certain location different from the main gate area, then being told to check the main gate area (Testimony 1) contradicts his claim of being in the Blue Badgermobile (Evidence 8).

If Evidence 8 (Blue Badgermobile) shows that the stadium was inaccessible or closed at the time, this would contradict her testimony of being there for a break.\n\nSince there is not enough specific detail, the clearest contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Evidence 9.

The statement \"And when the victim finally showed, he shot him from on high!\" (Testimony 2) also supports the idea of a shooting from above.\n\nThe contradiction would be with the evidence that shows Meekins' location.\n\nSince the evidences mostly are items, the Murder Notes (Evidence 6) would likely contain the actual details contradicting the testimony.\n\nTherefore, the pair is:\n\nEvidence 6: Mr. Deacon's Murder Notes\n\nTestimony 1: Officer Meekins lay in wait for the victim on top of the stage.\n",

However, Testimony 2 says Officer Meekins' story about the shop on wheels being stolen is a lie.\n\nOfficer Meekins is Character 7, and Lang is Character 4.\n\nIf we look at Evidence 5: Stolen Costumes, this likely refers to some theft at the crime scene. If Officer Meekins testified that a \"shop on wheels\" was stolen, that may be connected to the stolen costumes.\n\nIf evidence shows the shop on wheels was not stolen, but Lang claims Meekins lied about it, then that is directly contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the likely contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Stolen Costumes) and Lang's Testimony 2, about the stolen shop on wheels story.\n\nHence: Evidence 5 vs Testimony 2.\n",

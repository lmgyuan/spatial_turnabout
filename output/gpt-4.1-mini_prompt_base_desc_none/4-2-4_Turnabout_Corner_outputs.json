    "cot": "Evidence 13 is Wocky's Check-Up Report, which presumably contains medical information, possibly including dates. Testimony 4 from Alita says, \"Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?\" This implies the chart is old, half a year old. But testimony 0 says, \"I did go to the clinic that day. My first time in half a year, since I quit in January,\" which suggests the timing of her visit relates to half a year as well.\n\nHowever, the contradiction is between the fact that the chart is claimed to be half a year old and that the visit would have been for something current (or the reverse). The real contradiction is between Alita saying she went to the clinic \"that day,\" and \"Why would I go now for a half-year-old chart?\" which implies the chart was from six months ago, but she is said to have just gone.\n\nTherefore, the testimony \"I did go to the clinic that day. My first time in half a year, since I quit in January\" (Testimony 0) contradicts the implication from Evidence 13 (Check-Up report being old). Alternatively, if the chart is recent, it contradicts her statement about the chart age.\n\nThus, the contradiction is between Evidence 13 (Wocky's Check-Up Report) and Testimony 4 (Alita's statement about not going for a half-year-old chart).\n",

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

1. Testimony 1 states, "The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00," according to Vasquez.
2. Evidence 11, "Mr. Monkey's Head," indicates that the path to the scene of the crime was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.
3. The time of death on Jack Hammer's autopsy report (Evidence 3) is 2:30 PM.

Inconsistency:
- If the meeting ended at 4:00 as stated in Testimony 1, then Vasquez could not have gone to the scene unless through an alternate route, since the evidence indicates the path was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

Therefore, whereas Testimony 4 states "At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting," the timing conveniently aligns with Jack Hammer's time of death when the path was blocked, raising doubts about the validity of Vasquez's claim regarding her whereabouts during the break.

Thus, Testimony 4 regarding the timing of the break may conflict with the autopsy report's time of death, given the path was blocked during the specified time frame.

******************************
To find the contradiction, we need to analyze the provided evidence and testimonies carefully. Here, we want to find an inconsistency between the evidence and a testimony from Vasquez.

Step 1: Look at important pieces of evidence.
- Evidence 3: "Jack's Autopsy Report" mentions the time of death is 2:30 PM.
- Evidence 11: "Mr. Monkey's Head" blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

Step 2: Check Vasquez's testimonies to find a contradiction.
- Testimony 0: "I was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body."
- Testimony 5: "I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes."

Step 3: Identify the contradiction using the evidence.
Vasquez claims she was present when the body was found, but Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. This means she couldn't have accessed the scene during the time she claims to have found the body (aligned with the time of death) since it was physically blocked.

Conclusion:
Vasquez's testimony of finding the body conflicts with the evidence that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked access to the scene during the relevant time frame.

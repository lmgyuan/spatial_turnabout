To find the contradiction between the evidence and the testimonies provided, let's carefully examine each piece of evidence and testimony:

Testimony 3 states: "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." This implies the victim, Dr. Grey, did not defend himself during the attack.

Now, let's examine the evidences:
- Evidence 8, Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report, states that after being stabbed in the chest, he was shot in the forehead at point-blank range. Notably, there is gunpowder residue around the bullet hole, indicating a close-range shooting.
- Evidence 9, the Pistol, is identified as the murder weapon, and it had both Maya's and Grey's fingerprints, suggesting Grey might have held or touched the gun.

Given the presence of Dr. Grey's fingerprints on the murder weapon (the pistol), it is reasonable to infer that Dr. Grey could have been trying to defend himself or was involved in a struggle, which contradicts the testimony that Dr. Grey was "without a doubt, not fighting back."

This suggests a possible contradiction. Let's present the relevant evidence and testimony in JSON format:

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

- Testimony 3 claims, "The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed." 
- Evidence 8, "Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report," describes how Dr. Grey was shot in the forehead at point-blank range and gunpowder residue was found around the bullet hole. This implies the shot did not miss.

The testimony contradicts the evidence because if the shot missed, there wouldn't have been an entry wound in Dr. Grey's forehead with gunpowder residue indicating a point-blank shot.

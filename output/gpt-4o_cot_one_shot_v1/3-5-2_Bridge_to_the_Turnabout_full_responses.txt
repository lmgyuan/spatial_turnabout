Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

We have Evidence 6, which is "Iris's Hood," stating, "Received before the lights out bell the night of the crime." This implies that Iris received her hood and presumably wore it before the crime took place until the lights out bell.

However, Testimony 3 from Bikini states, "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner." This suggests that Iris was wearing her dinner attire, not her hood, contradicting the implication from the evidence that she would have been wearing or at least carrying her hood as it was received before the lights out bell and presumably part of her regular attire for the evening.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

1. Evidence 5, "Photo of Elise," states that Elise Deauxnim was wearing a white robe and a hood at the time the photo was taken. 
2. Evidence 9, "Victim's Staff," mentions there was no crystal sphere attached, indicating it was possibly lost during the incident.
3. Testimony 3 by Bikini states, "Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on," suggesting Iris was not wearing her hood at the time of the crime.

There's an apparent contradiction regarding character appearance or an action related to them between the photo evidence and Bikini's testimony about what someone was wearing or not wearing. However, a clearer contradiction lies in the interaction between the object's presence in evidence and the actions described by testimonies.

Upon deeper inspection:
- Evidence 16, "Crystal Sphere," states that it was found near Dusky Bridge and came from the victim's staff.
- Testimony 5 by Bikini states, "The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window," indicating the sequence of events that would not align with how the crystal sphere got from the scene to Dusky Bridge, especially as the sphere comes from the staff and should've been at the primary crime scene.

This deeper contradiction lies between:
- Testimony 5 (which interconnects the place of the stabbing in relation to the fall and sequence of events) and 
- the physical evidence of where the Crystal Sphere was found (indicating potentially altered sequences or other events).

However, re-examining the phrasing points to:
- Testimony, Testimony, and item focus on related articles differing in situational context, like time and object presence, especially Iris's hood and the presence of the victim at the murder scene.

In summary:
The contradiction directly lies between Bikini’s testimony about the timing and place of the "stabbing" occurring after a fall and the separation of the object (crystal sphere) that shouldn’t have ended up so far as per the events lined up. Let's narrow down to:
- Testimony 5 and the evidence being separate, yet interlinked in contradiction with the object origin and event flow expected otherwise.

******************************
Let's examine the evidence and the testimonies provided. Bikini, in Testimony 5, claims she witnessed "Mystic Ami" stabbing "Mystic Elise" through the back. However, Elise Deauxnim's Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) states the time of death was from "loss of blood from a stab in the back" and Elise was not stabbed by "Mystic Ami", but by another person based on other evidences and contexts. Additionally, the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is described as "not the murder weapon," which contradicts the claim that Elise was stabbed in the back with the weapon seen by Bikini. This discrepancy suggests that Bikini may have misinterpreted the scene or was mistaken in her testimony regarding the murder weapon and the act of stabbing itself.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}
******************************
To identify the contradiction between evidence and testimony, we need to carefully analyze the statements and the items provided in the question.

**Testimony Analysis:**
- Testimony 0: Bikini claims she saw the murder at around 11 PM.
- Testimony 1: She mentions reporting the murder and then heading to the Main Gate.
- Other testimonies mainly discuss tracks and snowmobiles, which are irrelevant to the direct contradiction sought.

**Evidence Analysis:**
- Evidence 7: Weather Data states that snow fell until approximately 10:50 PM, and there was lightning between 10 and 11 PM. This data implies weather conditions around the time of the murder.
- Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report states the time of death is between 10 and 11 PM due to a stab wound.

**Finding the Contradiction:**
The contradiction lies in the timing of the murder observation. Testimony 0 by Bikini mentions seeing the murder at around 11 PM. However, the Evidence 11 states that the time of death was between 10 and 11 PM, not specifically at 11 PM. Furthermore, based on the weather report (Evidence 7), if Bikini saw the murder at exactly 11 PM, there could be issues considering the snow and lighting conditions previously.

Therefore, the most direct contradiction relates to the timing of events as stated by Bikini, conflicting with the specific Evidence 11 concerning the established time of death.

******************************
First, let's analyze the evidence and testimonies related to the timeline of events, specifically around the fire at Dusky Bridge.

1. **Testimony 1** from Butz states that a white flash almost blinded him while he was lying under his bedding. 

2. **Evidence 7** provides weather data, which mentions that lightning occurred from 10 to approximately 11 PM, and a lightning strike hit Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM.

Based on this information, when Butz saw the white flash and then observed the bridge on fire, the time likely corresponds to the period around 10:45 PM, when the lightning struck the bridge, setting it on fire.

3. **Testimony 0** from Butz claims that he went to the shack at around 9 PM, indicating his timeline should be after 10:30 PM when he looked out.

The contradicting point arises when comparing Testimony 0 and Testimony 1. Testimony 0 states he was at the shack by 10:30 PM, but Testimony 1 suggests he experienced the flash (lightning strike) when he was under his bedding, which could have been around 10:45 PM.

The presence of a contradiction depends on his presence at the shack outcompeting his witness of the event seen from likely within the shack context.

Let's identify the most direct contradiction related to lightning and fire’s timeline directly alternating the flashing. 

After examining the evidence and testimonies, it's recognized directly:
- **Evidence 7** provides a lightning timeline, allowing a clear establishment bridge wasn't initially on fire by 10:30 PM.
- **Testimony 0** reports presence outside by around 10:30 PM as if linking the timeline with misaligning direct engagements like position or witnessing event when describing.

The contradiction remains indirect potentially on personal account visibilities.

Let’s re-engage, then detect the second half:
For direct detailing contradictions:
 - Testimony states gasping events between lightning descriptions underlines unaligned pointing further mismatch on initial setup reinterpretation:

Here we need clarity cross-referencing to make the best answer concise, comparison on when immediate action occurred or flash on-site witnessed, contradicts timeline implied by fire elements allowed.

It shows solid representation disclosing differences around experiences about unintended delays.

******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 2 provided by Butz states, "I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!" This suggests that Iris was wearing her white hood at the time of the incident. However, Evidence 6, "Iris's Hood," states that it was received before the lights-out bell the night of the crime, which implies that Iris would not have had her hood with her to be seen wearing it during the incident.

Therefore, Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 6, as Iris's hood was not available to her at the time for it to be seen fluttering.

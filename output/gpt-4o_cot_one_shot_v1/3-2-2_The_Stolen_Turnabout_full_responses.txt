To find the contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, let's analyze the details provided.

Testimony 2 from Gumshoe states: "This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor."

Evidence 5, DeMasque's Calling Card, implies that a specific calling card was sent before this heist, which matches with the testimony provided.

The contradictions can be found by looking at descriptions and dates:

- Evidence 9, Security Camera Photo, documents that the camera captured something at around 1 AM on the night of the crime.
  
- Evidence 15, Kane's Autopsy Report, states that the time of death was 10/12 at 1 AM.

When cross-checking with previously sent calling cards and Gumshoe asserting this was the fifth heist, there's no direct contradiction solely with Testimony 2. To identify the contradiction, we need to examine other pieces of evidence like the Buzzer record.

Check the records:

1. Evidence 17, CEO Office Buzzer connects to the basement Security Guard Office.
2. Evidence 19, Buzzer Record, shows that the buzzer went off once at 1:02 AM on October 12 in the CEO's office.
3. Testimony 4 claims that the MO fits.

Essentially, this doesn’t directly contradict itself based on what is given, which suggests an examination of intended crime timelines and acts.

To illustrate a potential contradiction:
- The alibi or exact identity of the perpetrator might be suspect due to unclear direct relationships.

Thus, deducing from what's provided without changing content, the contradiction might involve assumptions about the suspect or misinterpretations in identifying when the fifth heist indeed involved or wasn't attributed through clear sent calling cards or events between the crime scene and detected actions.

Deciding one evidenced contradiction remains tough directly without assumptions against exact Buzzer behavior, key cards, timelines misalignment, particularly if related Evidence given doesn’t have the exact link as Testimony assuming confidence beyond direct contradiction facts nor mistaken identities were tested by the provided cards.

To strictly answer with a given contradiction between established testimony known facts as required:

To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, let's closely analyze the provided data. 

1. **Testimonies**:
   - Atmey states that events occurred around 1 o'clock in the morning.
   - He mentions being struck on the head and then using an emergency phone to call the police thirty minutes later.

2. **Evidences**:
   - The time of death for Kane Bullard in the autopsy report (Evidence 15) is listed as 1 AM.
   - The CEO Office Buzzer (Evidence 19) went off at 1:02 AM.

Let's look at Testimony 4: "Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police," which suggests Atmey called the police around 1:30 AM.

Examining the timeline:

- Bullard's time of death is noted as 1 AM.
- The CEO Office buzzer went off at 1:02 AM.
- If Atmey was involved directly with the events at 1 AM or closely linked to the crime scene interactions, this could put his statement in conflict with the exact timing of events, as his call was delayed until 1:30 AM when immediate action could have been expected. 

However, this reasoning alone does not clearly pinpoint a definite contradiction regarding a piece of evidence. In successful contradiction, let's address how the timings align with testimonies, especially the Crime Scene activities and how they align with an exact timeline of the crime (heisting, CEO room activity, etc.).

The discrepancy more directly arises on the point of when action was triggered by the police:
- **Buzzer Record** triggers very close to the time of death, suggesting immediate presence at the CEO crime scene significantly irrelevant by pushing Atmey's inactive timing claim**.
- **Atmey's testimony describes a delayed response**, while immediate police involvement should logically be triggered following the significant crime timing, indicating a realistic observing duty mismatched his statement of being struck and waking to an unspecified reaction time**.

Therefore, logically matching the biggest fault lies on how he reports his time within the step's incidents wrongly aligns within more evidence and earlier crisis proximity only squares directly against his supposed timing action (Testimony 4). 

The contradiction is between the time of the call and the activated buzzer seemingly aligning with the divine call of immediate activity involved in critical police response.

Final contradiction:

- **Evidence 15 (Autopsy Report)** shows the time of death is noted and effectively proximity adjoining with wakeful consciousness still involved at attention caught police's regard to be involving buzzer's call meant within immediate area ripple effect contradicting Atmey's testimony detail of delayed 30 minutes window initiation.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 by Luke Atmey states, "I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye." This implies that the thief attacked Atmey with a blow to his forehead.

On the other hand, Evidence 6, which is the "Shichishito," states: "DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime w/ a blow to the back of the head." 

These statements contradict each other because Testimony 5 suggests Atmey was hit on the forehead, while Evidence 6 states DeMasque hit him on the back of the head.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and the testimonies, let's first review the relevant details provided in the testimonies and evidences.

We'll start by examining each piece of information closely:

Testimony 3 states: "I donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!" from Ron, which implies that he was actively involved at the scene of some crime that night.

Now, let's consider Evidence 15, "Kane's Autopsy Report" which provides the "Time of death: 10/12 at 1 AM." Ron's Testimony 3 suggests his involvement at a crime scene. However, the time of the incident where Kane Bullard died is exactly similar to the time mentioned in Ron's testimony, thus suggesting a potential contradiction.

Upon reviewing the Buzzer Record and the mention of the CEO Buzzer having no fingerprints (Evidence 17), we see that the testimonies and some details do not match with the timeline accurately. Let's examine the connection in terms of contradiction.

After reviewing, Testimony 3 involves Ron actively claiming involvement in "the scene of the crime," but Ron's connected history with the crime scene is easily refuted by the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19), which indicates no alarm or buzzer activity during that time of the supposed crime from Ron's testimony (as the timeline of events claims no registered interaction with the office systems he implied to witness). 

Finally, finding these, we spot the contradiction between testimony itself. Noting that Ron implies physical evidence connecting him to the crime during events that involve tech not supporting the claim, here is the contradiction:

Ron testifies his direct presence at the scene with no technical evidence backing it up timing-wise, thus contradicting the facts present in the evidence timeline provided by the Buzzer Record, and verifies how it was triggered outside of claimed firsthand witness reports from Ron.

This presents the contradiction:

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3}

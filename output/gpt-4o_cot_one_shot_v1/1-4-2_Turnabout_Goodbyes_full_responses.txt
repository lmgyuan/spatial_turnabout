To find the contradiction between the given evidence and testimonies, let's carefully analyze the options provided:

1. **Lotta's Testimony (Testimony 0):** Lotta claims, "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!"

2. **Evidence 4 - Lake Photo:** This photo was taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Itâ€™s crucial to check what this photo might show.

In this scenario, the evidence and the testimony are about identifying a person on the boat. If the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) distinctly shows that it's impossible to identify the persons onboard due to darkness, distance, or lack of clarity, then it contradicts Lotta's claim of clearly seeing Mr. Edgeworth on the boat.

Thus, the contradiction occurs between Lotta's Testimony, claiming a clear identification, and the Lake Photo, which may show an indistinct image.

So, there's a contradiction between Lotta's claim of a clear view and the Lake Photo's potential lack of clarity.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

- Evidence 2, "Lotta's Camera," states that the camera is set to automatically take pictures when a loud noise is detected and is facing the lake.
- Testimony 3 by Lotta says, "The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower."

The contradiction arises because Lotta's testimony claims the camera was set up for a meteor shower, which would not typically need to detect a loud noise, while the evidence clearly states the camera takes pictures upon detecting loud noises, suggesting it was intended to capture something else, like someone firing a gun.

Let's analyze the provided evidence and testimonies.

Evidence 10, "Pistol," states that the murder weapon was a 22-caliber pistol that was fired 3 times and bears prints from Edgeworth's right hand. 

Evidence 11, "Lotta's Deposition," mentions, "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25."

Additionally, Testimony 7 by Lotta states: "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot."

Here's the contradiction: 

Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) claims that she only heard two gunshots. However, the pistol (Evidence 10) was fired 3 times. Testimony 7 doesn't account for this discrepancy, as it mentions hearing another gunshot after seeing a flash, but there were only two sounds initially reported.

This makes Evidence 10 (the pistol being fired three times) contradict with either the initial gunshot report in Evidence 11 (two sounds reported) or the gunshot observation in Testimony 7.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided for contradictions.

- Testimony 1 states: "And that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!" and Testimony 2 states: "Of course, when I say 'room', I mean Juan Corrida's room!"

- Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform) states: "Worn by De Killer on the night of the murder. One of its special buttons is missing."

This implies that the bellboy was actually Shelly de Killer disguised as a bellboy.

- Evidence 16 (Jammin' Ninja's Button) states: "Was ripped from his costume. Is covered in Corrida's blood. Found in Engarde's 'hakama'."

- Testimony 5 asserts: "Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!"

Will Powers is asserting that the person dressed as a bellboy was the assassin.

However, the evidence shows that the bellboy uniform that was used as a disguise was missing a button, indicating that the real assassin might not fit Powers' description exactly.

The contradiction lies between Will Powers' assertion in Testimony 5 blaming the bellboy solely based on his suspicion and the factual uncovering of the situation through Evidence 30, which proves the bellboy was Shelly de Killer in disguise, rather than a regular bellboy suspected by Powers.

Let's examine the evidence and testimonies to find a contradiction.  
  
We'll use de Killer's testimonies to match against the evidence list.   

Testimony 5 states: "But even more appalling is the creation and planting of the 'knife' and 'button'." This implies that the knife and button were fabricated or were intentionally placed to frame someone.  

However, Evidence 15, the "Knife," bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints, suggesting it was actually used in the crime. Additionally, Evidence 16, the "Jammin' Ninja's Button," was ripped from his costume and covered in Corrida's blood, indicating it was genuinely involved in the struggle.  

Therefore, the claim in Testimony 5 contradicts the details provided in these pieces of evidence, specifically the knife.

******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we must identify details that conflict directly.

1. **Testimony 3** by de Killer states: "One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews."
2. **Evidence 25**, the "Figurine," is described as a "wooden puzzle with a hollow inside," and only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it. This suggests that only Juan Corrida and Adrian Andrews had knowledge about the puzzle's interior. 
3. De Killer's testimony is about the bear figurine, which implies his role was limited to retrieving and delivering this item. The Figurine found inside the murder scene contains **Evidence 27**, "Celeste's Suicide Note," which exposes Engardeâ€™s misdeeds. Since Andrews was one of the only people known to understand the Figurine, it's unlikely de Killer would offer an item containing incriminating evidence to Andrews unless the full understanding and implications were hidden from him.

Therefore, the contradiction lies in the fact that de Killer was to deliver something to Andrews that every piece of evidence suggests should not contain business-critical secrets known by both Crime enforcing or conspiracy evidence. This contradiction underlines the lack of clear intentions or misunderstandings in what de Killer perceived his role as fulfilling to the target.

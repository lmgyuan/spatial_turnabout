Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies to find a contradiction.

Testimony 2 states: "I planned on giving an engagement ring to Regina..." provided by Trilo, who is a puppet and the alter ego of Ben. Testimony 5 further elaborates, "In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!"

Now, let's look at the evidence. Evidence 10 is a ring with the description "A cheap ring with an eerie sparkle. 'From T to R' is engraved on it." This implies that the ring meant for Regina from Trilo ("T") is no longer with him but was found elsewhere.

The contradiction here is between Trilo's testimony, which claims he still has the ring, and the evidence showing the ring was found separate from him.

To find the contradiction, we must align the testimonies and evidences relevant to each character to see if there is any inconsistency.

Analyzing the testimonies of Moe (Testimonies 0-4), we note that he claims to have seen the victim's symbols, including the silk hat and cloak, which were found at the scene and are typically associated with Max (Evidence 3: Silk Hat, Evidence 4: Promo Poster).

Now let's look at the evidence:

- **Evidence 3: Silk Hat**– Found at the crime scene.
- **Testimony 4**– Moe states the cloak was fluttering in the wind, so he couldn't see what Max was carrying.

Considering the details: 

- **Evidence 15: Max G. Bust**– A heavy bronze statue said to be removed from the cafeteria before the crime.
- **Testimony 4**– Moe mentions not being able to see what Max was carrying due to the cloak fluttering.

The contradiction can be identified here: If Moe claims to have seen the symbols clearly, especially when the cloak was fluttering, and even the statue was heavy and possibly carried under the cloak, it raises doubt on whether Moe could clearly see and not notice something like a heavy bust potentially obstructing the view of those symbols, casting doubt on his entire description.

Therefore, the contradiction arises between the testimony claiming the symbols were fully visible, and the questioning ability to spot the detailed scene if something like the bust (heavy object and highly relevant to the crime) was in play.

Hence, the contradiction is:
- **Evidence 15: Max G. Bust** which suggests Max might not be holding objects Moe described since carrying a bust challenges the clarity of seeing the symbols Moe described.
- **Testimony 4** where Moe saw the fluttering cloak but nothing else being carried.

Using this evidence and testimony, it implies Moe couldn't have seen Max's symbols clearly because of the obstruction by the object Max was likely carrying.

******************************
To find a contradiction, we need to compare the testimonies with the evidences.

1. **Testimony 0** states there were no white roses that night. Recall from **Evidence 4** (Max G. Promo Poster) that Max's symbols include a silk hat, a cloak, and white roses.
2. **Testimony 1** supports the presence of the other symbols (silk hat and cloak).
3. **Testimony 2** and **Testimony 3** emphasize the unmistakable presence of Max's silk hat the entire time Moe witnessed the scene. However, **Evidence 3** (Silk Hat) indicates it was found at the crime scene, which adds credibility to Moe seeing it.

Now, focusing on **Testimony 0**, which denies seeing white roses, and cross-referencing it with any evidence about the crime scene or Max:

- **Evidence 3** (Silk Hat) and **Evidence 4** (Max G. Promo Poster) suggest a contradiction. While Moe claims no white roses, the Max G. Promo Poster features white roses as one of Max's famous symbols. Furthermore, if Max was fully adorned in his symbols, white roses should have been present if the poster accurately represents his attire or items associated with him.

Thus, the contradiction lies within Moe's claim of not seeing the white roses (Testimony 0) against the promotional image of Max emphasizing their importance as one of Max's iconic symbols.

To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies provided, let's carefully analyze the relevant details.

First, we look for inconsistencies in the evidence and testimonies:

1. **Testimony 5 by Gumshoe** states, "And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene."

2. **Evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report)** lists the time of death as between 1:30 and 2:30 PM.

3. **Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony)** mentions, "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat."

4. **Evidence 12 (Crime Photo)** shows "an intact vase on each table."

The problem arises here: According to Evidence 18, a vase was broken at the scene, yet the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows intact vases on both tables. This discrepancy indicates a contradiction, as both cannot simultaneously be true if the photo was taken accurately after the crime.

Let's present this contradiction in the required JSON format:

```json
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 18}
```
******************************
Analyzing the evidences and testimonies provided, we focus on the pieces related to the incident and poison. Evidence 10 states Glen Elg died of potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. Evidence 16 indicates the poison bears Maggey's fingerprints, and Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) has Maggey's fingerprints and poison in it. 

Testimony 2 by Victor Kudo claims, "There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there." This implies that Maggey was seen putting the poison into the cup, aligning with her fingerprints being on the poison (Evidence 16) but contradicts the situation since direct observation of placing poison is usually very significant and should coincide with major involvement in the act. 

However, upon deeper inspection, Testimony 3 by Victor Kudo states, "The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed," which aligns with the poison's effect as described in other evidences but...
Evidence 18, Victor's Testimony contradicts his statement with Testimony 3 because he admitted, "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." which suggests a disturbance different from the simplistic action-flow of death upon sipping. The contradiction lies in his claim of witnessing detail when his attention span would have been disrupted by his vase accident.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To identify the contradiction, we need to compare the evidence and testimonies carefully.

1. **Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony** describes, "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry."

2. **Testimony 2: Kudo Testifies** that the "young man was listening to the wireless," at the scene and doesn't mention any vase-breaking incident.

Additionally, in **Evidence 12: Crime Photo**, it mentions that there was an intact vase on each table, which further suggests that the testimonies by Victor Kudo about an incident possibly involving breaking a vase contradict the evidence photo that shows an intact vase.

So, we will match **Evidence 12** with **Testimony 2** as they contradict each other. The vase-breaking incident mentioned by Victor does not appear to align with the scenario depicted by the crime photo.

Here is the JSON format with the identified contradiction:

```json
{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 2}
```
******************************
To find the contradiction, we need to compare the evidence and testimonies to see if any details are inconsistent.

Let's summarize Testimony 2 and Testimony 3:
- Testimony 2 by Victor Kudo states: "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over."
- Testimony 3 by Victor Kudo states: "It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!"

Testimony 2 and 3 together imply that a vase was broken, causing the tablecloth to get soaked.

Now let's look at Evidence 12 (Crime Photo):
- Evidence 12 (Crime Photo): "A photo of the scene taken from near the kitchen. Two dining tables are separated by a folding screen. The one closer to the camera is empty. The other one is where the victim collapsed on the table. There is an intact vase on each table."

This crime photo shows that both vases on the tables are intact, which contradicts Testimony 2 and 3. Testimony 2 and 3 suggest a vase was knocked over, yet the crime photo shows no broken vase.

Therefore, Testimony 2 and 3 contradict the Crime Photo provided as Evidence 12.

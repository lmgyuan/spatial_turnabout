To find a contradiction, we should examine the evidence descriptions in relation to the testimonies. Here's a key detail:

- Evidence 9 (May Testimony) states: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck."
  
However, Testimony 8 from Redd White contradicts this by saying: "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!"

The contradiction is between where the victim ran according to different accounts. One claims the victim ran to the right, while the other claims she ran to the left.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 8}
******************************
To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, we must carefully examine the provided items.

First, let's consider the testimonies from White, specifically Testimony 1: "When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left." Cross-reference this with the evidence we have regarding the murder scene.

Now, take a look at Evidence 9, called "May Testimony," which says: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck."

Notice the contradiction:
- Whiteâ€™s Testimony 1 claims that "she first ran to the left."
- Evidence 9, "May Testimony," contradicts this statement by saying she ran to the right.

Thus, the contradiction lies between White's testimony that claims the victim initially ran to the left and the documented "May Testimony" that states she ran to the right.

Here is the identified contradiction in JSON format:

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 1}

******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

In Testimony 2, White claims, "Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!"

However, Evidence 9, which contains the May Testimony, states, "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck."

These two statements contradict each other. White claims Mia ran to the left, while the May Testimony states she ran to the right.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}
******************************
To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we'll examine the testimonies and evidences given:

1. **Testimony 3** by White states: "That is when I saw this glass light stand."
2. **Evidence 2** is described as: "The broken remains of a glass light stand. Broken beyond all recognition."

However, the crucial piece is **Evidence 3**, which mentions a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder.

If White truly saw the glass light stand during the initial intrusion to place the wiretap (as he claims in testimony), the timeline does not align with the fact that the receipt for the glass light stand is dated just one day before the murder, suggesting that the stand was actually present very shortly before the murder, after the wiretap placement.

Therefore, Testimony 3, claiming that White saw the stand earlier, conflicts with Evidence 3 regarding the timeline of events around the light stand.

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 3}

Let's examine the evidence and testimonies for contradictions.

- Testimony 4 states: "I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes."
- Evidence 11, Mr. Monkey's Head, states that it blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

Cody claims he got lost for about 30 minutes, which implies he tried to arrive earlier. However, if Cody got lost and arrived when he claims to have seen the fight (before 2:30 PM, when Jack Hammer's time of death is recorded), Mr. Monkey's Head would have blocked the path from 2:15 PM onwards. Thus, he couldn't have seen the events he described during that time. His account of getting lost and his timeline do not fit the circumstances reported in the evidence.

******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, let's examine Cody's testimonies in relation to the evidence provided:

1. **Evidence 15** ("Cody's Camera") notes that Cody always carries his new digital camera but is still learning how to use it. 

2. **Testimony 5** states, "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." 

There is a contradiction between these two because:
- Cody, described as still learning how to use his camera, claims he managed to erase the photos, suggesting he had familiarity with the device's more advanced features. This seems inconsistent with his purported lack of expertise.

Thus, Testimony 5, contradicts the description of Evidence 15.

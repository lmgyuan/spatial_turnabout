Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies for contradictions.

- Testimony 5 by Edgeworth states: "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream."
- Evidence 18, the "DL-6 Case File," says: "the murder weapon was fired twice."

Contradiction: Edgeworth remembers hearing a single gunshot, but the DL-6 Case File states that the murder weapon was fired twice.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}

To identify the contradiction, we need to match testimonies against the evidence of the case. Let's consider "Testimony 5" from Atmey:

- Testimony 5 states: "At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th."

Now let's look at the relevant evidence:

- Evidence 5: "DeMasque's Calling Card" suggests Mask DeMasque was supposed to steal the urn as the most priceless work of art on display.
- Evidence 7: "Camera Data" indicates the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM on the night of the crime.
- Evidence 15: "Kane's Autopsy Report" establishes the time of death as 1 AM.
- Evidence 19: "Buzzer Record" indicates the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM.

"Testimony 5" by Atmey claims he had the urn at 1 AM. However, this contradicts the "Camera Data" (Evidence 7), which implies an event (such as someone entering or exiting the crime scene) occurred at 1 AM. The buzzer went off at 1:02 AM ("Evidence 19"), suggesting another event just after 1 AM, potentially the crime itself.

Atmey's claim about holding the urn also conflicts with other information, such as the time of Kane Bullard's death (1 AM) and the timing of other events being closely packed around that time. It's improbable Atmey could have been performing his half of the deed and also dealing with the urn precisely at 1 AM when other activities and the crime were occurring.

Therefore, Testimony 5's claim about the urn doesn't logically fit with the timeline of events indicated by the evidence.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 5}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided for contradictions.

1. Look at the testimonies that refer directly to evidence pieces. 
2. Testimony 0 states, "I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever."
3. Evidence 18, Kane's List, is found on a table at the crime scene.
4. If Atmey had no contact with the victim (Kane Bullard), it's strange that his name is associated with evidence found at the crime scene, suggesting a connection or contact with the victim.

Therefore, there is a contradiction between Evidence 18 and Testimony 0.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 0}

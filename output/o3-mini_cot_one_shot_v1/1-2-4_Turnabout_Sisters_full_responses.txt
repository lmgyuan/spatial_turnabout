Evidence 9, titled "May Testimony," states that “The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.” However, Testimony 8 from White says, “The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!” This clear discrepancy in the direction the victim ran (right versus left) contradicts each other directly.

Testimony 6 states, "You see? You hit her twice!" implying that the victim was struck with two blows. However, Evidence 5 – Mia's Autopsy Report – indicates that the victim suffered a single blunt force trauma and died instantly. This contradiction between the multiple strikes mentioned in the testimony and the single strike determined by the autopsy is significant.

Testimony 2 by White states that “I saw Miss Mia run to the left,” yet Evidence 9, labeled “May Testimony,” records that “The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.” This direct contradiction regarding the victim’s direction clearly indicates a conflict between the two pieces of evidence.

Testimony 3 claims that upon entering the Fey & Co. Law Offices, White saw the glass light stand. However, Evidence 8—the Floor Plans—clearly show that the light stand is blocked from view from within the office. This means White’s claim of having seen the stand contradicts the physical layout presented in Evidence 8.

Testimony 0 from Lotta claims she saw Mr. Edgeworth on the boat, implicating him as being at the scene. However, Evidence 20—a Letter from the Safe that reads "Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth"—implies that someone was targeting Edgeworth rather than incriminating him for the murder. These two items conflict because if Edgeworth were the murderer on the boat as claimed by Lotta, it would be odd for a note to encourage someone to seek revenge on him, suggesting instead that Edgeworth was being set up as the target.

The contradiction lies in the purpose of Lotta's Camera. Evidence 2 clearly states that the camera is triggered automatically by a loud noise, whereas Testimony 3 from Lotta claims that the camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.

Testimony 0, in which Iris claims she witnessed the events in the Inner Temple garden, is directly contradicted by Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony), which states that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and then remained in her room until the murder was discovered. This discrepancy makes it impossible for Iris to have been in two places at once, indicating that her accounts conflict with each other.

******************************
Testimony 1 claims that Mystic Maya stole Mystic Elise’s weapon—suggesting that Elise’s weapon went missing from her possession. However, Evidence 9 (the Victim’s Staff) is described as the staff Elise carried when she was alive and it still bears her fingerprints. This directly contradicts the claim that her weapon was stolen.

Testimony 6 by Iris states, "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." However, Evidence 7—the Weather Data—reports that snow was falling from 7 PM until approximately 10:50 PM, overlapping the murder time (10–11 PM per the autopsy report). This timing discrepancy between Iris’s account and the weather evidence makes this pair contradictory.

Testimony 4 states that Maya saw a man in the light of the stone lantern, indicating that the lantern was lit. However, Evidence 20 clearly states that the stone lantern was not lit the night of the crime, which contradicts Maya's account.

******************************
Testimony 4 by Maya states that “all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up,” implying that no fresh snow should be present at the scene. However, Evidence 7—the Weather Data—indicates that it was snowing with snowfall recorded until about 10:50 PM on the night of the crime. It would be nearly impossible to remove the snow in such conditions, making these two accounts mutually contradictory.

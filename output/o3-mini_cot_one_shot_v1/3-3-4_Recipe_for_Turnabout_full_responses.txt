Testimony 0 mentions that there was a mirror in the middle of the restaurant that divided the space, yet Evidence 12's crime photo shows that the space was divided by a folding screen, with no mirror in sight. This inconsistency between the described scene in the testimony and the photo creates a contradiction.

Testimony 3 claims, "Z'ere were no other customers," yet Evidence 3—a Sports Paper found in Tres Bien—is noted as having been left by a customer present at the scene. This directly contradicts the assertion that there were no other customers.

Evidence 20, which is Glen's Calendar noting “Meet with The Tiger” on Dec. 3rd (the day of the incident), directly contradicts Tigre’s Testimony 1 where he claims he was tied up with business in his office all day. If Tigre were entirely in his office, he couldn’t have had a scheduled meeting as indicated on the calendar.

Testimony 0 from Tigre states, "I ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg." However, Evidence 20, "Glen's Calendar," shows a note on December 3rd stating "Meet with The Tiger," which clearly indicates that the victim, Glen Elg, had an appointment with Tigre. This creates a contradiction between Tigre's claim of never having met Glen Elg and the evidence that he was scheduled to meet him.

Tigre’s first testimony claims he was supposed to meet “wid the kid” at the restaurant that afternoon. However, Glen’s Calendar (Evidence 20) clearly shows a note saying “Meet with The Tiger,” indicating that the intended meeting was between Tigre and Glen—the victim—not with a kid. This discrepancy between the scheduled meeting on Glen’s calendar and Tigre’s stated appointment constitutes a direct contradiction.

Testimony 7, where Tigre states "I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!" implies he directly took the murder into his own hands for financial gain. However, Evidence 16—"Potassium Cyanide"—was found with Maggey's fingerprints in her apron pocket, strongly linking the poison (and thus the murder) to her instead. This presents a contradiction between Tigre’s claim of being the killer and the forensic evidence implicating Maggey.

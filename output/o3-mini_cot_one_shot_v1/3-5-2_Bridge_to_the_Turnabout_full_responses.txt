Evidence 12 presents Iris's Testimony as stating that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and then stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. This contradicts Testimony 3 from Bikini, where she claims that Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed as she had been at dinner. These contradicting accounts about Iris's whereabouts create a notable discrepancy.

******************************
Testimony 3 states, "Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on," implying that Iris was not wearing her hood at the time. However, Evidence 6 describes Iris's Hood as a hood that Iris wears at all times. This contradiction between the consistent presence of the hood in the evidence and its absence according to the testimony makes these two directly at odds.

Testimony 2 from Bikini claims she saw the moment the blade was drawn from the hilt—implying that the sword was active in the murder. In contrast, Evidence 10 (the Shichishito) explicitly notes that although it had the victim's blood and suspect’s fingerprints, it is not the murder weapon. This pairing shows a clear contradiction between what the witness claims and what the evidence tells us.

******************************
Bikini’s final remark casts doubt on Iris’s stated alibi. In Evidence 12, Iris claims that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. Yet in Testimony 5, Bikini implies that Iris was capable of leaving her room—“driving a snowmobile” to commit the crime—which contradicts Iris’s self‐declared alibi.

Testimony 0 gives a rough timeline of events by suggesting that when Butz went to the shack at around 9 it was already nearly 10:30 PM. By contrast, Evidence 7 (the Weather Data) specifically tells us that the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM—marking the likely start of the fire. This creates a clear contradiction between Butz’s estimated timeline in his testimony and the precise time indicated by the weather report.

******************************
Testimony 2, in which Butz claims "I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!" directly contradicts Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) stating that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and then stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. If Iris were safely confined in her room as her testimony claims, she couldn’t be seen flying around, making the two statements mutually exclusive.

Testimony 4 claims that the defendant's fingerprints were all over the knife, yet Evidence 15 clearly states that the knife bears Engarde's fingerprints. If the defendant is different from Mr. Engarde, this is a direct contradiction.

Testimony 5 states that the man leaving Juan’s room was wearing a flashy racing jacket, yet Evidence 17 – Lotta's Photo – clearly shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. This discrepancy between the clothing described by the testimony and that captured in the photograph is a direct contradiction.

Testimony 4 states, "So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan," implying that the assailant was dressed in the Nickel Samurai outfit. However, Evidence 9—the Crime Photo—shows the victim Juan Corrida seated in a samurai outfit. Given that Juan Corrida is known as the Jammin’ Ninja (and thus not expected to wear a samurai costume), the photo contradicts Oldbag’s assertion by depicting the victim in the attire instead of the murderer. This is the clearest pair where the testimony and evidence are at odds.

Andrews claimed in Testimony 4 that she poured herself a glass of juice when she felt about to faint. However, Evidence 8 (the Wine Glass) shows that the glass was found full of tomato juice with her fingerprints on it and no sign it had even been partially consumed. This suggests her account doesn’t match the physical evidence at the scene.

Testimony 1 states, "I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over." This implies that Andrews handled the guitar case. However, Evidence 7, the Guitar Case, specifies that it bears only Corrida's fingerprints. If Andrews had indeed opened the case, his fingerprints would have been present, creating a direct contradiction between the testimony and the evidence.

Testimony 5 states, "That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt," implying the button originated from the victim’s costume. However, Evidence 16 (“Jammin' Ninja's Button”) describes a button that was ripped from a costume and found in Engarde’s hakama, implying it belonged to the killer’s outfit rather than Juan’s. This contradiction between the source of the button in the evidence and the account given in the testimony makes this pair contradictory.

******************************
Testimony 0 states, "That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself." Yet Evidence 8, the Wine Glass found next to the victim, is filled with tomato juice and notably bears Andrews’ fingerprints. This directly contradicts Andrews’ claim of not having poured the juice herself.

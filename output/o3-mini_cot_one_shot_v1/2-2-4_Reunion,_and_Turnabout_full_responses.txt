Ini's Testimony 2 states, "It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!" implying that Ini’s sister was present during the events. However, Evidence 6—a newspaper clipping—reveals that Mimi Miney, who was Ini’s sister and a nurse at Grey Surgical Clinic, died in a car accident a year ago. This contradiction between admitted presence in Testimony 2 and death in the Evidence makes this pair contradictory.

******************************
Testimony 6 states that Ini didn’t have her driver’s license and therefore couldn’t have taken over driving. However, Evidence 18 displays Ini's photo for her driver's license, indicating that she indeed has one. This directly contradicts her claim.

Testimony 0 states, "Like, around that time, I was, like, really close to getting my license," suggesting that Ini hadn’t yet received her driver's license. However, Evidence 18 is labeled “License Photo” and is described as Ini’s photo for her driver's license, implying that the license process had progressed far enough to have already produced her license photo. This is inconsistent with her claim of only being close to getting the license.

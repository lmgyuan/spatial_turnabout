Testimony 8 states, "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot," implying that Cody did not have his camera with him at that moment. However, Evidence 15 – Cody's Camera – notes that Cody always carries his camera. This discrepancy indicates a contradiction between the testimony and the evidence.

Testimony 3 states, "But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it," implying that Cody’s camera malfunctioned at a critical moment. However, Evidence 15 clearly describes Cody’s Camera as a brand new digital camera that he always carries—there’s no indication of defects or malfunctions in its description. This contradiction suggests that Cody’s claim about his camera failing does not align with the evidence of it being a reliable new device.

Testimony 5 states, "Thus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?" However, Evidence 15 describes Max G. Bust as a heavy bronze statue taken from the cafeteria—a weighty object that, if dropped, could very well cause blunt force trauma like that reported in the autopsy. This contradiction—where Acro dismisses the possibility of the bust being used despite its intimidating heft—stands out.

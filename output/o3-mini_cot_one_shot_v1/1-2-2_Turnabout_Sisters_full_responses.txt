Gumshoe’s Testimony 2 claims he found a piece of paper next to the victim’s body with the name “Maya” written in blood. Yet when we look at the evidence labeled “Maya’s Memo” (Evidence 4), its description shows it’s actually a cell phone recording of a conversation with Mia—not a bloodstained paper. This is a clear contradiction between what Gumshoe describes and what the evidence actually is.

******************************
April May's testimony refers to a clock – "that... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?" – as the murder weapon, yet the evidence (the Receipt) shows the purchase of a glass light stand (supported by the broken Glass Shards), implying a different object was involved. This direct discrepancy between the weapon April identified and the item evidenced contradicts her account.

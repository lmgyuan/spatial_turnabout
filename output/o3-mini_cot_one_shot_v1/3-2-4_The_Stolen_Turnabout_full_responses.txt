Testimony 5 claims, "At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th." However, Evidence 22 (the Paint Marks) reveals that the box containing the Sacred Urn had clear, dry paint stains from when it was dropped two weeks prior by Adrian Andrews. This physical trace indicates that the urn had already been handled well before October 12th. Therefore, the claim that it was Atmey's first time holding the urn is contradicted by the evidence showing earlier contact with the urn.

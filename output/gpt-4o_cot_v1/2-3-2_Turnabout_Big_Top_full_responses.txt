To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we first narrow down the relevant elements.

Testimonies from Trilo focus on the engagement ring he planned to give Regina Berry:
- Testimony 2: "I planned on giving an engagement ring to Regina..."
- Testimony 3: "I kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her."
- Testimony 5: "In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!"

Now, let's look at the evidence:
- Evidence 10 is a ring with an engraving that reads "From T to R", suggestive of "From Trilo to Regina".

Contradiction:

Trilo claims in Testimony 5 that he still has the ring in his pocket, meaning it should be with him. However, Evidence 10, the ring, is presented as evidence, implying it was found and not on Trilo. This discrepancy suggests a contradiction: the ring cannot both be with Trilo and in evidence at the same time.

To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we need to pay attention to the details given in both the testimonies and the evidences, and see where the inconsistencies lie.

Let's analyze Moe's testimonies:
- Testimony 0 states that a shadow could only have belonged to Max.
- Testimony 1 mentions seeing Max's symbols.
- Testimony 2 specifies Max's silk hat and black cloak were present.
- Testimony 3 mentions that even though Max's face was silhouetted, there was no doubt it was him.
- Testimony 4 notes that the cloak was fluttering in the wind, obscuring what was being carried.

Now, let's cross-reference with the evidences:
- Evidence 2: Crime Photo displays the crime scene, showing the victim in the snow with footprints.
- Evidence 3: Silk Hat indicates it was found at the crime scene and is a symbol of Max’s presence.
- Evidence 12: Wooden Box is locked and heavy, found with the victim.
- Evidence 15: Max G. Bust is a heavy bust removed from the cafeteria.
- Evidence 16: Note suggests meeting at the lodging house plaza at 10:00 PM.
- Evidence 19: Scarf details Bat's scarf stained with blood and pepper.

The key contradiction seems to lie between Moe's repeated assertions of seeing Max's symbols such as the silk hat and the cloak (Testimonies 1 and 2) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) that shows the scene with the footprints and the absence of someone in those distinctive symbols. Particularly, Testimony 2 says that the hat and cloak were both seen, while the Crime Photo shows footprints leading to the body without clearly confirming the presence of these items at the scene which were initially used to identify Max.

Considering this, we notice a possible contradiction between Moe's certainty in Testimony 3, claiming without doubt it was Max, based on shadow and silhouette, and the fact that the hat itself, a key identifier, was found at the scene separately without proof it was being worn.

The contradiction is as follows: Moe is certain it was Max despite the face being obscured due to recognizing symbols like the hat, yet the hat found separately adds doubt to its presence on someone.

Therefore, a possible contradiction arises between Evidence 2 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3 regarding the presence of Max identifiable by his appearance when the hat was later found separate at the scene.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find the contradiction, let's carefully go through the evidences and testimonies.

First, let's summarize the testimonies given by Moe:

- Testimony 0: Moe states that there were no white roses that night.
- Testimony 1: Moe confirms that all of Max's other symbols were present.
- Testimony 2: Moe specifically mentions the silk hat and recalls seeing its decorations.
- Testimony 3: Moe asserts that Max was wearing the silk hat the entire time at the scene.

Now, let's analyze the evidence:

- Evidence 2 (Crime Photo): This photo shows the crime scene with the victim (Russell Berry) lying on a case in the snow. The victim’s footprints are visible leading to where he is.
- Evidence 3 (Silk Hat): This is Max's unique fedora that is part of his symbols. Importantly, it was found at the crime scene.

The contradiction hinges on Testimony 3 and Evidence 3:

In Testimony 3, Moe claims Max was wearing the silk hat at the scene the entire time. However, Evidence 3 reveals that the silk hat was found at the crime scene, implying it was not worn by Max the entire time as Moe testified. 

Therefore, Moe's statement that Max was wearing the silk hat the entire time directly contradicts the fact that the hat was found at the crime scene.

This is the contradiction we need to identify:

To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonials, we'll focus first on understanding what's being claimed by each testimonial and the details of each piece of evidence:

1. **Testimony 3 by Bikini**:  
   - Claims that Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed exactly as she was at dinner.

2. **Iris's Hood (Evidence 6)**:
   - It is a hood that Iris wears at all times and was given to her before the lights-out bell on the night of the crime.
   - There's also an implication that Iris wouldn't be seen without this hood for protection.

3. **Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12)**:
   - States that after ringing the lights out bell at 10 PM, she was in her room until the murder was discovered.

Considering these points together:
- If Iris was in her room after 10 PM as per her testimony, then the claim made by Bikini that she saw Iris at the Inner Temple contradicts Iris’s testimony.
- Furthermore, if Iris always wears the hood and it's crucial for her protection, the implication that she might appear without it (which is what Bikini may witness) might be dubious without the physical hood observed.
  
However, the most straightforward contradiction arises here between **Testimony 3** where Bikini claims to see Iris after that time, which directly conflicts with the statement in the **Iris’s Testimony (Evidence 12)**, where Iris claims to be in her room and the fact that, according to Iris's hood, she seems to not leave the premises after lights out unless for witnessing constrained actions, outlines a clearer mismatch.

Thus, there seems to be a more direct contradiction with evidence showing Iris’s whereabouts during the time in question.

Hence, the contradiction is between Bikini's testimony claiming to see Iris and Iris's claim of being in her room until the murder was discovered.

To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, let's examine the details closely:

1. **Testimony 3 by Bikini:**
   - "Iris didn't have her hood on."

2. **Evidence 6: Iris's Hood**
   - A hood that Iris wears at all times. A magical hood said to offer protection from evil spirits.
   - Received before the lights out bell the night of the crime. Protects from evil spirits.

The contradiction lies in the fact that Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) is described as a hood that Iris wears at all times. This magical hood was received before the lights out bell the night of the crime, and it suggests Iris would have been wearing it during the incident. However, Bikini's testimony says Iris didn't have her hood on, which contradicts the claim that she wears it at all times. 

Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) and Testimony 3 from Bikini.

******************************
To identify a contradiction, we need to examine the evidence and testimonies closely. Let's do this step-by-step.

First, let's go over the relevant evidence and testimonies:

1. **Evidence 10: Shichishito**
   - Described as the apparent murder weapon.
   - Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon.

2. **Testimony 3: Bikini's Statement**
   - "I've never seen so much blood before..."

3. **Testimony 5: Bikini's Statement**
   - "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!"

Next, we further analyze the details:

- **Evidence 10 indicates the Shichishito was thought to be the murder weapon but is actually not.**
  
- **Testimony 5 suggests that Bikini awoke to witness an attack, specifically a stabbing, indicating she perceived an ongoing violent act.**

Given these details, we look for inconsistencies:

- **Bikini's Testimony 3 ("I've never seen so much blood before...") expresses shock at the amount of blood.**

- Here lies our contradiction: 
  - Her testimony aligns with a perception of witnessing blood from a significant wound, the blood would already have pooled from the initial injury, not from an observed ongoing stabbing. 
  - Elise Deauxnim died from a stab wound according to the autopsy and there should have been no continuous blood loss visible if she was already dead during Bikini’s testimony.

Putting these observations together, we can reasonably deduce which testimony contradicts the evidence regarding the murder weapon and the manner of death:

- Specifically, Testimony 5 observes a stabbing act -- potentially implying that witness Bikini observed Elise Deauxnim being injured in real-time, which doesn’t align with already established facts that the apparent murder weapon (Shichishito from Evidence 10) was not the actual murder weapon used to kill Elise.

Therefore, the pair that represent a contradiction is:

**Evidence 10: Shichishito** and **Testimony 5: "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!"**

This indicates a mistaken belief that the observation was of an effective act of the murder which doesn't match the fact of the murder weapon's real role.

******************************
To determine which evidence contradicts the testimony, let's evaluate the information given:

1. We have a testimony from Bikini stating:
   - Testimony 3: "It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!" (referring to a snowmobile).

2. The relevant evidence pieces that could relate to traveling to Dusky Bridge are:
   - Evidence 13: Crime Photo (courtyard where the crime occurred, may not be directly relevant to travel)
   - Evidence 14: Tracks Photo (Taken that night. One track is shown leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge)
   - Evidence 21: Dusky Bridge Photo (Taken the morning after the crime, might show weather or condition of the bridge)

3. The context around travel and timing could be affected by weather:
   - Evidence 7: Weather Data (indicating snow with occasional lightning, and stating the time when the lightning struck the bridge)

Upon analyzing these:

- Bikini's Testimony 3 is about the speed of traveling to Dusky Bridge using a snowmobile.
- Evidence 14, Tracks Photo, shows a track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, which supports the use of a snowmobile.
- However, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) states that snow was occurring until 10:50 PM.
  
The contradiction could arise if there are claims about using the snowmobile during a time when footprints should have been covered by snow, or if there's a specific time implicated where the snow would affect traveling conditions.

To make a thoughtful conclusion:
- If Bikini's testimony about the ease and time of snowmobile travel is referenced to a time when weather (snow) data implies complications (either obscuring evidence or affecting post-snow travel), there is a potential contradiction.

Given the constraints, it is reasonable to assert:

- **Bikni Testimony 3** implies efficient snowmobile travel.
- **Evidence 7** (Weather Data) mentions snow falling until 10:50 PM.

Thus, if Bikini mentions travel to the bridge post-snowy period and no new tracks indicate other behavior, that's contradictory.

Ultimately, analyzing contradictions can be complex, but verifying snow's impact on travel supports evidence/explanation:

To find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony, we need to go through each testimony and see if any statements contradict the presented evidences. 

Let's examine the relevant evidence and testimony:

- Testimony 3: "There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out." (by Larry Butz) implies that there was thunder when Larry went to check the situation.
- Evidence 7: "Weather Data" indicates that lightning, which causes thunder, occurred between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM.

According to Testimony 3, Larry claims to have responded "right away" upon hearing thunder, suggesting he went out while the weather was still active. However, looking at other testimonies (such as Testimony 0: "I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM..." — by Butz) this might mean he actually left the shack denying the timing of the thunder as he allegedly ran out right after a thunderclap indicative of being too late or mismatched, especially if combined with other testimony.

Now, find the contradiction with the evidence:

If we consider the timeframes:

- Lightning (hence, thunder) occurred between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM. (Evidence 7: Weather Data)
- Larry says he went to the shack at 9 PM and it would have been about 10:30 PM (Testimony 0)
- He also says in Testimony 3, "There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out."

This could mean a misunderstanding of the exact chain, if we analyze further, understanding the sequence of proceeding circumstances but not directly contradictory but implying a strange timeline, needs additional interpretation.

A definite contradiction is present:

- Butz states he began witnessing the events (running towards) at 10:30 PM, well within the thunder window, this fits, the contradiction is heavy inference related but if rendering indirectly.

Thus, regarding testimonies, since they seem congruent in one narrative, including evidence 7 corrects distinct variations:

However, there seems to be an internal consistency across testimonies 0-6:

JSON identification like below is hypothetical based on aforementioned indirect reasoning:

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1} 

Note, the direct contradiction would be better if plausible direct alterable activities were presented with subsequent logical reasoning, hypotheticals derived from circumscribed details.
******************************
To identify a contradiction between the evidence and the testimony, we need to consider the details and context provided by each.

Firstly, let's examine the testimonies given by Larry Butz:

- **Testimony 0:** Larry describes himself as an artist.
- **Testimony 1:** He claims he was sketching in front of the bridge and was in a frenzy of art.
- **Testimony 2:** He saw Iris flying, with her white hood fluttering.
- **Testimony 3:** He transferred the shock and awe he felt directly onto the page.
- **Testimony 4:** He describes the flames going out and then someone coming running up.

Next, let's review the evidence available:

- The **Weather Data (Evidence 7)** states that there was a fire around the Dusky Bridge, which started due to a lightning strike at 10:45 and went out approximately 30 minutes later. Given this timing, we can infer that the fire was over by around 11:15 PM. 

- Additionally, the **Tracks Photo (Evidence 14)** shows a track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, indicating some form of movement happened that night in connection to the bridge.

The contradiction can be identified between Testimony 4 and the Weather Data's specific details about the fire on the bridge and the time it went out.

Larry's testimony about the flames going out followed by someone running up may indicate a timeline issue when matched against the Weather Data. 

However, it's crucial to note if any evidence directly contradicts the claim of a fantastical element such as "I saw Iris flying!" in Testimony 2. The **Photo of Elise** (Evidence 5) and **Iris's Testimony** (Evidence 12) about her activities that night might serve or offer context, but neither fundamentally reveals a contradiction to Larry's claim of artistic interpretation, which might involve exaggerated perceptions.

Instead, Testimony 2, of seeing something unrealistic like "Iris flying," is more fantastical and contradicts known logical evidence—particularly **Iris’s Testimony** (Evidence 12), where she states she was in her room after 10 PM until the murder was discovered. This means she couldn't have been seen "flying."

So, our identified contradiction lies between Iris being seen "flying," which was visually oriented in a certain way by Butz and Iris’s confirmed whereabouts and activities that night.

Here’s the pair in JSON format:

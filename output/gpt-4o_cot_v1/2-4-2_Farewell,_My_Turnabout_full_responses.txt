To resolve the contradiction between evidence and testimony, we must closely examine the details given for each and cross-reference them.

Firstly, let's review the evidence related to Gumshoe's testimonies:
- The evidence of interest is the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16), which Gumshoe mentions in Testimony 2 and Testimony 3.
- Gumshoe states that the button was ripped from the ninja costume and was found in Matt Engarde's "hakama" (Testimony 3).

Now let's check the evidence contemporary to these testimonies:
- Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) is explicitly mentioned, with details: "Was ripped from his costume. Is covered in Corrida's blood. Found in Engarde's 'hakama'."

Upon examination, these details appear consistent with Gumshoe's testimonies. There doesn't appear to be a direct contradiction here.

Next, consider the evidence in relation to another potentially contradictory testimony:
- Testimony 5 by Gumshoe claims that the defendant (Matt Engarde) bought the knife for the crime, implying premeditation.

Against this, examine:
- Knife (Evidence 15): It states, "Bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints. In the grip, 'Gatewater' is engraved."

However, there is no specific evidence that confirms Engarde bought the knife, nor is there an direct indication of purchase or premeditated intent within the evidence. The engraving 'Gatewater' could suggest that the knife is from the hotel or a set, possibly contravening the claim of individual purchase by Engarde.

Thus, there appears to be no decisive contradiction between the testimonies mentioned and the evidence since they align or provide no definitive counter-claim.

On further examination, another pair stands out:
- Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3): It details that the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) was to confess something after the post-ceremony stage show.
- In conjunction with Testimony 5 about premeditation, having planned a press conference to confess something might imply Engarde had elsewhere intended not related to the murder.

So any potential contradiction is speculative based upon inference rather than direct contradiction.

On continuing our search:
- The contradiction seems primarily based on the inference drawn from the assertion by Gumshoe of premeditated intent (as in Testimonies 5, 4, and 3) versus the circumstantial nature in the context surrounding the knife as per Evidence 15 endowment bearing similarity (possibly implying hotel provision).

Therefore, upon thorough consideration and re-evaluation:
- Evidence 15 (Knife) contextually contradicts Testimony 5 regarding alleged premeditated purchase by Engarde due to hotel engraving indication not expressly proving individual acquisition intent or act.

Thus: {"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}
******************************
To identify a contradiction, we need to compare the testimonies with the pieces of evidence to see if any evidence directly conflicts with any statement given by the witnesses.

In testimony 3, given by Oldbag ("That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room."), she indicates that a man came out of Juan Corrida's room. Testimony 4 specifies that this person was Matt Engarde, who was trying to sneak out of Juan's room. 

We need to verify this against any evidence that might contradict this specific detail about Engarde coming out of the room. The other evidence we need to consider is:

- Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17): The description indicates that it was taken in the Hallway right after the murder, capturing a person in samurai garb standing outside the door.

Oldbag saw Engarde coming out of the room, while Lotta’s Photo suggests it might have been someone else—or possibly someone dressed differently (in a samurai costume). If the person captured is the one leaving the room and was dressed in such a garb, it directly contradicts Oldbag's testimony of Matt Engarde, who supposedly was wearing his flashy racing jacket (Testimony 5).

Thus, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (claiming the person seen was Matt Engarde) and the fact that the person was in samurai garb, as shown in Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo).

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 4}
******************************
To find the contradiction, we need to compare the evidence and testimonies provided to see if there's any inconsistency between them.

Let's analyze Oldbag's testimonies:

1. Testimony 0: "Engarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!"
2. Testimony 1: "The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!"
3. Testimony 2: "Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder."
4. Testimony 3: "He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know."
5. Testimony 4: "So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan."

Oldbag's testimonies suggest that the person who committed the murder was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume, which is also suggested to be Matt Engarde's character. However, she mentions a post-ceremony stage show immediately after the crime, referencing Matt Engarde needing to be somewhere in his costume right after the crime.

Now, let's look at the evidence:

- Evidence 2: The Nickel Samurai is a glossy photo of Maya's pushed costume picture.
- Evidence 3: Press Conference Ticket suggests that the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something after the post-ceremony stage show.

The contradiction comes from Testimony 3 and Evidence 3. If Matt Engarde had to go to the post-ceremony stage show after the murder, he would not have had time to commit the crime altogether. The sequence doesn't allow for him to commit the murder if he was scheduled to be somewhere immediately afterward publicly, meaning his alibi may be reinforced by his obligation to attend the stage show.

Hence, the correct contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 3.

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we need to analyze the provided information closely:

1. **Testimony 3 (Andrews)**: "What I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo." 
   - This implies that Andrews claims to have seen the exact scene depicted in the crime scene photo at the time she found the body.

2. **Crime Photo (Evidence 9)**: It shows Juan Corrida's murder scene with a knife in his chest and a glass of juice behind him on the dresser, among other details. 

3. **Wine Glass (Evidence 8)**: It was found next to the victim filled with tomato juice, with no sign of being drunk. Yet, it bears Andrews' fingerprints.

4. **Testimony 4 (Andrews)**: Andrews claimed that after seeing the scene, she felt as if she were about to faint and poured herself a glass of juice.

From this analysis, here's the contradiction:

- **Crime Scene Photo (Evidence 9)**: Shows the crime scene where there is a glass of juice on the dresser and it's full, untouched.
- **Testimony 3**: Andrews claims that she saw the exact same scene as the crime scene photo, implying she did not change anything at the scene.

However, since the glass of juice had her fingerprints (Evidence 8) and she claimed to pour herself juice (Testimony 4), Testimony 3 contradicts Andrews' later testimony and the evidence of the wine glass because she did interact with the scene, contrary to her claim in Testimony 3 of observing the scene as it exactly was in the crime scene photo.

Therefore, the contradiction lies in Testimony 3 and the Crime Photo (Evidence 9), as she claims she saw the scene as it was in the photo, but interaction with the scene indicates otherwise.

******************************
To find contradictions, we need to examine the evidence and testimonies closely to identify inconsistencies. 

First, let's consider the testimonies given by Adrian Andrews:

1. Testimony 0: "I don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed."
2. Testimony 1: "I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over."
3. Testimony 2: "It's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all."
4. Testimony 3: "As for why I opened the case... Even I don't know."

Testimony 1 suggests Adrian assumes she opened the guitar case after knocking over a vase. 

Now, let's look at the evidence entries related to the guitar case:

- Evidence 7: "Guitar Case" - Found next to the victim. Empty. There is some water, but only on top of the lid. Bears only Corrida's fingerprints.

Testimony 1 and 2 from Andrews state she probably opened the guitar case after knocking over the vase and asserts the guitar case was empty. If Andrews had indeed opened the case as she implied, her fingerprints would be present. However, according to Evidence 7, only Corrida’s fingerprints are found on the guitar case. This suggests Andrews did not open the case, contradicting her testimony. 

Focusing on Testimony 3, she states not knowing why she opened the case, which indirectly implies she did open it. However, the presence of only Corrida's fingerprints on the case (Evidence 7) contradicts this. 

Hence, there is a contradiction between Andrews's implication of opening the guitar case in Testimony 3 and the evidence stating it only bears Corrida's fingerprints.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, let's analyze each piece of testimony provided by Adrian Andrews and look at the evidence that could potentially contradict it.

1. **Testimony 0** - "From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer."
   - This is not directly contradicted by any specific evidence, as it refers to a feeling upon seeing the crime scene.

2. **Testimony 1** - "Matt had to kill Juan no matter what."
   - This isn't directly contradicted by any evidence since a motive isn't strongly refuted by evidence alone.

3. **Testimony 2** - "I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right."
   - This is a claim about motive, which could relate to the suicide note, but there isn't a strong contradiction since Andrews admits to lack of direct evidence.

4. **Testimony 3** - "And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder."
   - Evidence 21 is a "Spy Camera" set in the victim's room and running during the time of the murder, capturing the event. This could potentially provide an alibi depending on the footage it captured, potentially contradicting the claim that Engarde did not have an alibi.

5. **Testimony 4** - "My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife..."
   - This testimony refers directly to the evidence of the button and knife, which doesn't provide internal contradiction.

6. **Testimony 5** - "That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt."
   - This relates directly to the button and doesn't have an external contradiction.

7. **Testimony 6** - "But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him..."
   - This is more about her feelings and does not contain evidence contradiction directly.

After consideration, it seems **Testimony 3** is the most likely candidate for a contradiction. Andrews' assertion that Matt had no alibi could be contested by the existence of the spy camera footage (Evidence 21), as it could potentially provide information or contradiction regarding Engarde's whereabouts during the murder.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Adrian Andrews' Testimony 3 and Evidence 21, which is the Spy Camera.

{"evidence": 21, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find the contradiction, we need to analyze both the evidence and the testimonies carefully.

First, let's examine the testimonies from Adrian Andrews:

1. Testimony 0: Andrews says the glass of juice wasn't poured for herself.
2. Testimony 1: Andrews was surprised at the messy state of the room.
3. Testimony 2: Andrews describes seeing Juan slumped over and tired in the corner.
4. Testimony 3: Andrews didn't initially think Juan was dead.
5. Testimony 4: Andrews thought he fainted and went to pour him some juice.
6. Testimony 5: Andrews knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead.

Next, let's look at the relevant pieces of evidence:

- Evidence 8 (Wine Glass): Found next to the victim, filled with tomato juice. It shows no sign of being drunk, and it bears Adrian Andrews' fingerprints.
- Evidence 9 (Crime Photo): Juan Corrida is shown with a glass of juice behind him on the dresser.

Now let's compare Testimony 4 and Evidence 8:

- In Testimony 4, Andrews claimed she was going to pour juice for Juan Corrida because she thought he had fainted.
- However, Evidence 8 shows a wine glass with juice that hasn't been drunk and has Andrews' fingerprints. This implies the juice was not actually poured for Juan after the fact, and it was not likely an action taken with him fainted. 

However, another potential contradiction appears when considering:

- Testimony 5 where Andrews states she knocked over the vase when realizing Juan was dead.
- But in Evidence 9 (Crime Photo), the vase was clearly knocked over with water spilled, yet the juice wasn't consumed, contradicting her sequence of actions especially in relation to realizing his status.

To make it clearer, it feels more succinct when identifying the state discrepancies between Testimony 0's intent of juice pouring and the undrunk state indicated in Evidence 8.

Let's identify one concrete pair: Testimony 4 and Evidence 8 have a direct contradiction, as Andrews doesn't mention pouring juice into an untouched glass.

So, based on this logic, the correct contradiction is:

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 4}

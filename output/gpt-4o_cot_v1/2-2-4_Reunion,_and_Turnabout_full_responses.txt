To determine which evidence contradicts the testimonies, we should look closely at the statements made by Ini and see if any evidence provides information that conflicts with them.

Ini's Testimonies Analysis:
1. Testimony 0: "Like, when the channeling started, I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room."
2. Testimony 1: "Like, a little later, someone came into the room, like, really suddenly."
3. Testimony 2: "It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!"
4. Testimony 3: "I, like, hadn't seen her in, like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way..."
5. Testimony 4: "I wasn't, like, scared at all. And, like, her costume looked totally, like, normal."
6. Testimony 5: "My sister... She, like, told me something, like, totally terrible."

Now, let's examine the evidence to see where a contradiction may lie.

Key Evidence to Consider:
- Evidence 6: Newspaper Clipping 2 describes that Mimi Miney, Ini's sister, died a year ago in a car accident. This is a crucial point because Ini claims to have seen her sister, which directly conflicts with the established fact of Mimi's death.

Understanding the Contradiction:
- Testimony 2 ("It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!") directly conflicts with Evidence 6, as Mimi Miney is reported confirmed dead in a newspaper article.

Let's present this finding properly:

To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, let's analyze the given information:

1. **Evidence 18: License Photo** - This is Ini's photo for her driver's license, which is noted as Director Hotti's treasured possession.

2. **Testimony 6:** 
   - Ini states, "I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her."

**Analyzing the Contradiction:**
- Testimony 6 claims that Ini didn't have a driver's license on the night of the accident.
- However, Evidence 18 directly contradicts this claim, as it is a photo of Ini's driver's license, proving she did have one.
- The license photo's existence negates Ini's statement that she couldn't take over driving due to not having a license.

Therefore, Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 6 because Ini claims she didn't have a license, but the evidence shows she did.

******************************
To identify a contradiction between the provided testimonies and evidence, we need to carefully examine the details that could be in conflict. 

Let's focus on the testimonies provided by Ini and the corresponding evidence.

1. **Testimonies by Ini Miney:**
   - Testimony 0: Ini was close to getting her license at the time.
   - Testimony 1, 2, 3: Her sister Mimi was a fan of cars, had a new car from England, and wouldn't let a beginner drive it.
   - Testimony 4: Mimi didn't allow inexperienced drivers to operate her car.
   - Testimony 5: This is why Ini was in the passenger seat the night of the crash.

2. **Evidence related to the above:**
   - Evidence 18 (License Photo): Ini's driver's license photo.

When cross-examining the testimonies and evidence:

- **Testimony 0** states that Ini was close to getting her license around the time of the crash. This suggests that she did not have a license yet.
- **Evidence 18** is a driver's license photo of Ini, which implies that she did have a license. 

Thus, there is a contradiction between Testimony 0 and Evidence 18. Ini claimed she was close to getting her license, indicating she didn't have it yet, whereas the license photo suggests the opposite, that she already had a license.

To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we'll first look at the testimonies provided by Acro. Acro claims in Testimony 3 that exerting that kind of force on his lower body is not possible for him. This suggests that his lower body injuries prevent him from performing acts that require strength or force using his legs.

Next, we will examine the evidence. The Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows footprints leading up to the scene where the Ringmaster's body was found. If Acro claims he cannot use his legs to exert force, this evidence of footprints contradicts his claim, as it suggests mobility and an ability to move or drag something, potentially implicating someone other than Acro if his claim is valid.

The contradiction lies in Acro stating there is no way for him to exert force using his legs, yet the presence of footprints invalidates this claim. 

Now, I'll provide the answer in the required JSON format.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}

To find the contradiction, we need to match details from the testimonies with the evidence provided. Let's outline the steps clearly:

1. **Review the presented testimonies:**
   - **Testimony 0**: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
   - **Testimony 1**: I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
   - **Testimony 2**: On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
   - **Testimony 3**: Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
   - **Testimony 4**: Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
   - **Testimony 5**: Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!

2. **Analyze the pieces of evidence:**
   - **Evidence 3 (Receipt)**: A receipt with letters written in blood on the back.
   - **Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report)**: One point of interest here is that it states, "Death was instantaneous."
   
3. **Find contradictions between testimonies and evidence:**
   - **Testimony 5** asserts that before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name. However, **Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report)** clearly states that death was instantaneous due to blunt force trauma.

This is a direct contradiction: an instantaneous death would not allow the victim to write anything after being attacked.

Hence, the pair that contradicts each other is:
- **Testimony 5 (asserting the victim wrote the name before dying)**.
- **Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report, stating death was instantaneous)**.

Here is the contradiction in JSON format:

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, we need to closely examine both sets of information.

First, let's summarize the relevant evidence and testimony:

- **Testimony 3**: April claims she saw "the girl in the hippie clothes" (Maya Fey) hit Mia Fey with "that weapon" during the murder.
- **Testimony 4**: April further specifies the weapon as a clock, "The Thinker."

Now let's check the evidence about the weapon:

- **Evidence 1: The Thinker**: It is described as a clock in the form of a statue, but it's important to note it mentions "the clock's gears have been removed." This implies it doesn't function as a clock and is only a statue at the time of the murder.

The contradiction lies in the fact that April refers to "The Thinker" as a clock (Testimony 4), but according to the evidence (Evidence 1), it no longer functioned as a clock because its gears had been removed. Therefore, April's identification of the weapon as a clock is incorrect based on the evidence.

Thus, the contradiction is between April's testimony about the weapon and the evidence regarding the state of "The Thinker."

Here is the JSON output for the pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other:

```json
{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 4}
```

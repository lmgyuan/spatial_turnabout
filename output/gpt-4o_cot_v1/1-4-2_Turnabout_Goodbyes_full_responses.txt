To determine the contradiction between evidence and testimony, let's first analyze the given testimony and the related evidence:

**Testimony 0:**
- Testimony: "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!"
- Person: Lotta

Lotta claims that she saw Mr. Edgeworth clearly as the person on the boat.

**Relevant Evidence:**
- **Evidence 4: Lake Photo**
  - Description: Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click here for details.

The lake photo is a crucial piece of evidence because it was taken automatically by Lotta's camera when a loud noise, presumably a gunshot, was detected. Let's consider the implications:
- If the photo was taken in the middle of the night, visibility on the lake would likely be very limited.
- The photo may not provide a clear image of the people on the boat.

Given the context, the reliability of Lotta's claim of seeing Mr. Edgeworth clearly is questionable if the photograph does not provide sufficient detail to definitively identify someone on the lake at that time of night.

Thus, there seems to be a contradiction between:
- Lotta's testimony that she saw the man on the boat clearly as Mr. Edgeworth.
- Evidence pointing out (specifically Lotta's camera and how it operates, i.e., taking photos automatically rather than manually) that the clarity of identifying someone clearly is unlikely at that time of night.

Given this reasoning, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) seems to contradict Lotta's assertion about seeing Mr. Edgeworth clearly, due to potential visibility issues and the nature of the photograph evidence.

Therefore, the contradiction pair is:

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0}
******************************
To identify the contradiction, we must carefully analyze the evidence and testimonies given.

1. **Evidence 2: Lotta's Camera**
   - Description: Set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. Faces the lake.
   - This suggests that the camera was set to capture events triggered by sound, not by visual phenomena such as a meteor shower.

2. **Testimony 3 by Lotta: "The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower."**
   - This statement directly suggests that Lotta set her camera to capture visual events in the sky, such as a meteor shower.

Here, the contradiction is evident. Lotta claims in her testimony that the camera was set up to photograph a meteor shower, which indicates it was positioned and configured to take pictures based on visual stimuli high in the sky. However, the actual function of the camera, as outlined in Evidence 2, was to take pictures in response to sound events on the lake, not sight. 

Thus, the camera's settings for sound detection contradict Lotta's claim that it was set up for taking pictures of a meteor shower. 

Therefore, the evidence about the camera (Evidence 2) contradicts Lotta's Testimony 3 where she claims it was set up for watching a meteor shower.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, let's analyze each piece of testimony from Lotta Hart and compare it to the evidence related to the scene at the lake.

- Lotta Testimony 3: "That's why I was camping out by the lake." 
  - Author's intent: Lotta claims she was camping out by the lake to photograph the monster known as "Gourdy".
  - Related Evidence: Gourdy Article (Evidence 5) – An article about the monster sighted at Gourd Lake.

- Now let's look at other testimonies:
  - Testimony 5: Lotta states she was looking at the lake when she heard the "bang," implying her camera could have detected the noise.
  - Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) supports this by stating it automatically takes pictures when a loud noise is detected. However, no contradiction is found here.

- Testimony 7: Lotta mentions she saw a flash and heard another gunshot. This should align with photos taken by her camera.

- Let's focus on the statement: Testimony 6: "There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time."
  - Critical Evaluation: For Lotta to watch the boat "the whole time," we need to check relevant camera evidence. Moreover, two sounds like gunshots were reported.

- Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition): "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25."
  - Issue: Lotta claims to have been watching the boat the entire time and saw the flash of the gun, but her statement about the number of shots and the photographic evidence should align.

Connecting the camera and deposition:

- Lotta's Testimony 6 talks about constant looking at the boat, noting every detail. However, the camera didn't capture two flashes only once, calling into question if she saw both these events. If the camera was working, why didn't both events warrant the automatic picture as per the camera setup?

Thus, the real contradiction potentially lies with Lotta’s statement of continuously observing with no captured photographic evidence to support two events.

 Conclusion: "Lotta's Deposition" (Evidence 11), mentioning two gunshots, conflicts with her continuous view claim as the single photo may suggest otherwise or the timing should depict two events with no clear camera representation. Based on the setups, captured experiences, and possible missed opportunities via the photo, this contradiction could surface clearly.

After this analysis, the contradiction pairs:
Testimony 6 ("There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.") conflicts with the inability of evidence (captured photos) capturing all claimed unwavered views.

Final JSON answer:
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 6}

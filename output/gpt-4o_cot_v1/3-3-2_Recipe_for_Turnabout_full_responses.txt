To identify a contradiction between evidence and testimony, we need to carefully analyze each piece of information. Here's a closer look:

1. Start by examining the testimonies and see if anything seems contradictory based on what you know from the evidence.
2. Look into Testimony 2: "The victim didn't have any identification on him," provided by Gumshoe.
3. Next, review the list of evidences to check if there's something related to identification or the victim's possession.
4. Evidence 14, "Victim's Lottery Ticket," plays a crucial role here. It indicates the presence of a personal item connected to the victim.
5. Linking Gumshoe's Testimony 4: "When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison," suggests the lottery ticket was found on Maggey, indirectly indicating it was in the victim's possession.

Thus, it seems Testimony 2 and Evidence 14 present a noticeable contradiction:
- Testimony states no identification was found on the victim.
- However, the Victim's Lottery Ticket acts as a unique identifier connected to the victim's identity, as this ticket was discovered on Maggey but initially belonged to Glen Elg.

This creates a mismatch, as one suggests anonymity while the latter suggests identification through possession.

Let's summarize these thoughts:

To find the contradiction between the evidence and the testimonies, we need to carefully analyze each piece of evidence and compare them step by step with each testimony provided by Victor Kudo. Our aim is to identify one pair where the testimony given contradicts the established facts described in any of the evidences.

### Examine Kudo's Testimonies:
1. **Testimony 0**: The young man was reading the sports paper.
2. **Testimony 1**: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!
3. **Testimony 2**: There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.
4. **Testimony 3**: The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.
5. **Testimony 4**: That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!
6. **Testimony 5**: There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.
7. **Testimony 6**: There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.

### Examine the Evidences:
- **Sports Paper (Evidence 3)**: Dates from December 3rd, the day of the incident. It was left by a customer in Trés Bien and included the word 'MC Bomber'. This aligns with the note found in Glen's calendar that suggests a meeting with "The Tiger" on the same day.
  
- **Crime Photo (Evidence 12)**: A photo of the crime scene shows a knocked over coffee cup, tablecloth stained by coffee, some pieces of papers near the coffee table and no one else sitting across from the victim at the time. There is also a second table with an intact vase.

### Identified Contradiction:
- **Testimony 0**: Mr. Kudo testified that the young man (Glen Elg) was reading the sports paper, suggesting he had the paper in his possession at the time of the incident.
  
- **Crime Photo (Evidence 12)**: The description of the crime scene reveals Glen was alone at the table indicating no second individual, like Mr. Kudo, responsible for confirming he was indeed reading a sports paper at that exact time.

Kudo's testimony that Glen was reading the Sports Paper contradicts the setup in the Crime Photo where Glen was alone and no other person, including Kudo, was shown to be vicinity involved or verifying such action at the moment of murder.

Therefore, the contradiction can be captured between Kudo's claim that Glen was engaged with the sports paper and the evidence that suggests Glen was likely alone without verification at the time.

Thus, we conclude with the following contradiction pair:
**Crime Photo** (Evidence 12) vs. **Testimony 0** by Kudo.

{
  "evidence": 12,
  "testimony": 0

******************************
To identify which evidence and testimony contradict each other, let's analyze both the testimonies and evidence carefully.

Let's examine each piece of testimony from Victor Kudo:

1. Testimony 0: Kudo describes the victim as wearing a broken pair of spectacles.
2. Testimony 1: Kudo mentions the victim had a newspaper in his right hand.
3. Testimony 2: Kudo states the victim was listening to the radio.
4. Testimony 3: Kudo recalls the waitress bringing the javaccino (coffee).
5. Testimony 4: Kudo says the victim picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.

Differently from this, let's take a look at the evidences related to the testimony:

- Evidence 12 (Crime Photo): The photo shows the scene with the victim collapsed on a table. The evidence notes there were pieces of paper on the table near the victim's collapsed position.
- Evidence 19 (Millionaire Radio Flyer): Describes a radio program at 1:30 PM, which matches the radio Kudo mentioned.
  
However, the contradiction we are looking for can be better highlighted with:

- Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup): The coffee cup is said to have Maggey's and the victim's fingerprints, with a lip stain on the front. Notably, the handle is to the right. 

In Victor Kudo's Testimony 3, he mentions that the waitress brought over the javaccino. In Testimony 4, he specifically says the victim picked up the cup with his free hand and sipped it. If Maggey's and Glen's fingerprints are on the same coffee cup, this normally implies they should have handled it differently.

To clearly show a contradiction, if Kudo is describing these actions while the coffee is untouched before the victim sips, he does not account for Maggey having her fingerprints on it, and he does not describe the presence of the lip stain and specific handle orientation. 

However, more crucial is the idea that in the context of Testimony 4 — describing the victim as using his free hand to sip — should account for how the cup was held. This is allowed by looking to the photo showing a stand-alone table (Evidence 12) or typically just how someone handles a coffee cup picked up in practice, as the testimony doesn’t account properly for how that happened.

Conclusively, a stronger contradiction arises here — between the way the victim is portrayed picking up the cup in a specific manner and how logistically this unassumingly includes the detail of the fingerprints found.

Hence, because of the pieces in this logic, the contradiction exists between Testimony 4 and Evidence 13.

**Explanation:**

- Testimony 4: Kudo's description of the victim leaves out the context as the victim's free hand doesn't correlate to how familiar presence of bi-directional fingerprints would otherwise establish.

- Evidence 13: Reveals specific finger interaction on the cup that’s crucially omitted by the testimony.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (about the literal handling of the cup) and Evidence 13 (describing fingerprints). Here's the output in JSON format:

```json
{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 4}
```
******************************
Let's analyze the testimonies and evidence to find a contradiction.

1. First, we need to identify what each piece of testimony is stating and whether it matches the evidences.

2. Looking at Victor Kudo's testimonies, the key statement is testimony 3:
   - "It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!"

3. Now let's look at the evidence, particularly Evidence 12: Crime Photo.
   - A photo of the scene taken near the kitchen shows two dining tables separated by a folding screen. The one closer to the camera is empty. The other one is where the victim collapses on the table. There is an intact vase on each table. A coffee cup is knocked over, and the tablecloth is stained by coffee.

4. Testimony 3 from Kudo states that the vase broke and the cloth got completely soaked.
   - However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the vase on the table is intact, contradicting the testimony claim that it broke.
   
Thus, the contradictions are between Testimony 3 (Victor Kudo) and Evidence 12 (Crime Photo).

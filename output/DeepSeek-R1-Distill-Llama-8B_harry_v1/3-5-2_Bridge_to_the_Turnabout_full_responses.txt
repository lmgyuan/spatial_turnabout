Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me go through each testimony and see how they relate to the evidence provided. 

Starting with Testimony 0 from Bikini: He was helping an acolyte in the Inner Temple that night. But... Hmm, the ellipsis suggests he was about to say something else but got interrupted. Maybe he was involved in some way.

Testimony 1: His back was acting up violently. So he couldn't stay there long. This might mean he left early or couldn't perform certain actions due to pain.

Testimony 2: He left Iris to help the acolyte and returned to the temple. So, he was with Iris before, implying they were together at some point.

Testimony 3: Iris came to the Inner Temple while dressed similarly to dinner. So she was there after he left, or maybe she was there while he was helping the acolyte.

Testimony 4: He needed a bath because there wasn't one at the Inner Temple. So he went somewhere else to soak, which would take time, and then returned later.

Testimony 5: After he finished, he was heading back when he saw something. That something could be related to the crime.

Looking at the evidence, I see that Evidence 7 mentions the weather was bad that night, with snow and lightning. Lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45. The body was found around 10-11 PM, and the fire started earlier, taking about 30 minutes to go out.

Testimony 4 says he needed a soak, which would take time, and then he returned later. So if he left the temple after helping the acolyte, went to get a bath, and came back, he might have missed the time window when the crime happened.

But wait, let me think about the timeline. The crime happened around 10 PM, with lightning at 10:45. If he finished at the Inner Temple around the time the crime occurred, he might have been there during the murder. But Testimony 5 says he saw something after finishing, which might be after the crime.

Wait, the crime started around when the fire was reported, and the body was found at 10 PM. Lightning struck at 10:45. So the crime happened before the lightning. If he was at the Inner Temple helping the acolyte, then left Iris, then went to bathe, which would take time. If he finished around the time of the lightning, he might have been gone, but the crime happened earlier.

Alternatively, if he was at the Inner Temple helping the acolyte, then left Iris, then went to bathe, he might have missed the time when the crime occurred. So his absence could mean he wasn't present when the murder happened.

But let me check the evidence again. Evidence 7 says the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, and the body was found around 10-11 PM. So the crime happened around 10 PM, before the lightning. If he left the Inner Temple around the time of the crime, he might have been elsewhere, like bathing, and thus not present to witness anything.

So Testimony 4 says he needed a bath and went for a soak, which would take time, and then returned. If he returned after the crime, he wouldn't have seen anything related to it. But Testimony 5 says he saw something after finishing, which might be after the crime. However, the crime was already over by 10 PM, and lightning struck at 10:45. So if he saw something after finishing, maybe he was there during the crime.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure this:

- Crime happened around 10 PM, with lightning at 10:45.
- Body fell 10 ft after death, so death around 10 PM.
- Evidence 7: Fire started around 10 PM, went out around 11 PM.
- So the crime started when the fire was reported, around 10 PM.

If he was helping the acolyte until after 10 PM, he might have been present during the crime. But Testimony 4 says he left to bathe, which would take time, so he might have been away.

Wait, but the crime happened at 10 PM, and he needed a soak. If he left after the acolyte was done, which could be around 10 PM, then he was gone when the crime started. So he wouldn't be present to witness anything, contradicting the crime timeline.

Alternatively, if he was still there, he would have seen something, but he wasn't because he went to bathe. So Testimony 4's need for a bath and leaving the temple would mean he wasn't present during the crime, contradicting any evidence that suggests he was there.

Looking at the evidence, Evidence 12 is Iris's testimony that she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. So she was there during the crime. If Bikini was with her earlier, then left to help the acolyte, then went to bathe, he might have missed the crime.

Wait, but Testimony 2 says he left Iris to help the acolyte and returned to the temple. So he was there again after helping the acolyte, but if he left to bathe, he might have been away during the crime.

So the contradiction is between Testimony 4, where he went to bathe, and the crime happening around 10 PM. If he went to bathe, he wasn't at the temple during the crime, contradicting any evidence that suggests he was there.

Wait, but the evidence doesn't directly say he was there. The testimonies are from Bikini. So if he was helping the acolyte, then left Iris, then went to bathe, he might have been gone when the crime happened, which would mean he wasn't present to do anything, conflicting with any implication that he was involved.

Alternatively, if he was present during the crime, he wouldn't have gone to bathe. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and the crime timeline.

I think the key is that if he was helping the acolyte until after 10 PM, he would have been away when the crime happened. So Testimony 4, where he needed a soak, would mean he was away, contradicting the crime's timing.

So the pair that contradicts would be Testimony 4 (Bikini) and the evidence related to the time of the crime, perhaps Evidence 7 or 12.

Wait, but the question is to find one pair. Let me see:

Testimony 4: He needed a bath and went for a soak, taking time, and then returned later. So he was away during the crime time.

Evidence 7: The crime happened around 10 PM, with lightning at 10:45. So if he was away, he wasn't there to commit the crime or witness it.

But the evidence doesn't directly link him to the crime, but his testimonies do. So the contradiction is that he was away, thus not present, but perhaps the evidence suggests he was there.

Wait, no, the evidence doesn't directly say he was there. So maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and the timeline of the crime.

Alternatively, if he was at the Inner Temple helping the acolyte until after the crime, he couldn't have been there, contradicting the crime's timing.

I think the main point is that if he was at the Inner Temple helping the acolyte, he would have been there during the crime time, but he went to bathe instead, thus not being present. So Testimony 4's need for a bath contradicts the possibility that he was present during the crime.

Therefore, the pair is Testimony 4 (Bikini) and the evidence related to the crime time, which is Evidence 7. But the question asks for evidence and testimony. So perhaps Testimony 4 and Evidence 7.

Alternatively, the testimonies are from Bikini, so the contradiction is between his testimonies and the evidence.

Wait, the user wants a pair of evidence and testimony. So I need to match a testimony with an evidence that they contradict.

Looking at the testimonies again:

Testimony 4: He went to bathe because there was no bath at the Inner Temple.

Evidence 7: The weather was bad that night, with lightning striking at 10:45.

If he went to bathe, he was away from the temple during the crime time, which was around 10 PM. So he wasn't present to commit the crime or witness it, which might contradict the idea that someone was there during the crime.

But the evidence doesn't directly link him to the crime, so maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5: After he finished, he saw something. If the crime happened at 10 PM, and he saw something after finishing, maybe he was present during the crime.

But if he went to bathe, he wouldn't have been there.

So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (needing to bathe) and Testimony 5 (seeing something after finishing). If he went to bathe, he wouldn't have been there to see anything, so Testimony 5 would be false.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 and Evidence 7: If he was away bathing, then the crime happened while he was gone, which might contradict some timeline.

But the user wants one pair. Let me think again.

The key is that the crime happened around 10 PM. If he was helping the acolyte until after 10 PM, he was away. But Testimony 2 says he left Iris to help the acolyte and returned to the temple. So he was back after helping the acolyte, but if he left to bathe, he was gone during the crime.

So the contradiction is that he was away, thus not present, but perhaps the evidence suggests he was there.

Wait, but the evidence doesn't directly say he was there. The testimonies are from him, so it's about his own actions.

I think the main point is that he was at the Inner Temple helping the acolyte, then left to bathe, thus not present during the crime. So Testimony 4, where he went to bathe, contradicts the timeline of the crime, as the crime happened while he was away.

Therefore, the pair is Testimony 4 (Bikini) and Evidence 7 (Weather Data), as the weather was bad, but he was away.
</think>

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 4}
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence or character contradicts which testimony. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand the setup. There are multiple pieces of evidence and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where one evidence or character directly contradicts a testimony. The answer should be in JSON format, like {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}.

Looking at the testimonies, they are from a character named Bikini. There are five testimonies, from Testimony 0 to Testimony 5. Each testimony provides some information about what Bikini saw or did that night.

Now, I'll go through each testimony and see if any of them contradict any evidence.

Testimony 0: Bikini says he finished his bath around 11 PM and thought he should return to the Inner Temple.

Looking at the evidence, Evidence 7 is the Weather Data, which mentions that there was snow and lightning strikes. Lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, and around 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out.

If Bikini finished his bath around 11 PM, that would mean he was in the Inner Temple around that time. But the murder happened around 10-11 PM. So, if he finished his bath at 11 PM, he would have arrived after the murder was already in progress or just after it happened. But according to the Weather Data, the lightning struck at 10:45 PM, which is when the fire started. The body fell 10 feet after death, and the time of death was around 10-11 PM.

If Bikini finished his bath around 11 PM, he might have arrived after the murder was already solved or after the suspect had left. But the testimony says he thought he should return to the Inner Temple, implying he was on his way back around 11 PM. This might not directly contradict the evidence, but it's worth noting.

Testimony 1: Bikini heard a noise from the courtyard and took a look, seeing Iris (Elise) with a sword.

Looking at the evidence, Evidence 10 is Shichishito, the murder weapon, which is a seven-branched sword. So, if Bikini saw Elise with this sword, that aligns with the evidence. However, Testimony 5 says that the stabbing happened after she was pushed out of the window, implying she fell and was then stabbed. That might conflict with the autopsy report, which says she lost blood from a stab in the back and fell 10 feet after death. So, if she was pushed out of a window before being stabbed, that would mean the stabbing happened after her fall, which aligns with Testimony 5. But I'm not sure if this directly contradicts anything yet.

Testimony 2: Iris was Elise, and with that sword, of all things! So, this matches the evidence about Shichishito.

Testimony 3: Now that you mention it, Iris didn't have her hood on.

Looking at the evidence, Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which is supposed to offer protection from evil spirits. If Iris didn't have her hood on, that might mean she wasn't using it to protect herself, which could be significant. However, I'm not sure if this directly contradicts any evidence.

Testimony 4: Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.

This seems to align with the Crime Photo (Evidence 13), which shows the courtyard where Elise was murdered. So, if she was in the corner room, that makes sense.

Testimony 5: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.

This would mean that Elise fell out of the window first and then was stabbed, which matches the autopsy report (Evidence 11) that she fell 10 feet after death. However, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, around the time of the fire. If Elise was pushed out of the window around 10:45 PM, that would be during the lightning strike, but the autopsy report says she died between 10-11 PM. So, this could mean she was pushed out before the lightning strike and then died later, which fits.

Wait, but if the lightning struck at 10:45 PM, and the fire started around then, and the body fell after death, perhaps the stabbing happened after the lightning strike. So, if she was pushed out after the lightning, that might align with the timeline. But I'm not sure if this is a contradiction.

Now, looking back at Testimony 0, if Bikini finished his bath around 11 PM, he might have arrived after the murder was already solved. But the evidence suggests that the murder happened around 10:45 PM, so if he finished at 11 PM, he was there after the crime. That might not necessarily be a contradiction, but it's a point to consider.

Putting it all together, the most likely contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11. Testimony 5 says the stabbing happened after she was pushed out of the window, implying she fell first. Evidence 11's autopsy report says she fell 10 feet after death, which supports that she was alive when she fell and then died from the stab wound. So, Testimony 5 aligns with the evidence, not contradicts it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. If the stabbing happened after she was pushed out, that would mean she was alive when she fell, and then she died from the stab wound. The autopsy report supports that. So, Testimony 5 actually aligns with the evidence. Therefore, maybe there's no contradiction there.

Looking again at Testimony 3, it says Iris didn't have her hood on. Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which is supposed to offer protection. If she wasn't wearing it, that could mean she wasn't using it, which might be relevant. But I'm not sure if that's a direct contradiction.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 6. If Iris didn't have her hood on, that contradicts the purpose of the hood, which is to offer protection. So, perhaps that's the pair.

Alternatively, considering the timeline, if Bikini finished his bath at 11 PM, but the crime happened around 10:45 PM, that might mean he wasn't there at the time of the crime, which could be a point of interest but not necessarily a contradiction.

I think the strongest contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11. Testimony 5 says the stabbing happened after she was pushed out, which aligns with the autopsy report that she fell 10 feet after death. So, perhaps there's no contradiction there.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a direct contradiction. Perhaps between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11.

Testimony 5: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.

Evidence 11: Autopsy Report says she lost blood from a stab in the back and fell 10 ft. after death.

So, Testimony 5 aligns with Evidence 11, meaning no contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 3: Iris didn't have her hood on, which might contradict Evidence 6, which is about her hood offering protection.

But I'm not sure if that's a direct contradiction. Maybe the answer is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11, but they actually support each other.

Wait, perhaps the answer is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 6. If she didn't have her hood on, that contradicts the purpose of the hood. So, {"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11, but they don't contradict.

I think the best answer is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 6, as not wearing the hood contradicts its protective purpose.

So, the final answer would be {"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}.
</think>

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out which evidence or character contradicts which testimony. The user has provided a list of evidence and testimonies, and I have to find a single pair where they contradict each other. The answer should be in JSON format, like {"evidence": x, "testimony": y}.

First, I'll go through each testimony and see what it says. Then, I'll check the evidence to see if any contradict the testimonies.

Starting with Testimony 0: "When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place." Person: Bikini. This suggests that the sword was already present when Bikini looked, maybe implying it was there before the crime happened.

Looking at Evidence 10: Shichishito, which is described as the apparent murder weapon. It had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints. So, Shichishito is the sword used in the murder.

Now, Testimony 5: "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" Person: Bikini. This testimony implies that Mystic Ami (Iris) was the one who stabbed Elise, which would mean Iris is the suspect.

But wait, Evidence 10 says that the suspect's fingerprints were on the sword. If Iris is the suspect, her fingerprints should be on Shichishito. However, Evidence 9 is the Victim's Staff, which has Elise's fingerprints but no crystal sphere. So, Shichishito is the murder weapon with the suspect's fingerprints, which should be Iris's if she's the killer.

But Testimony 3 says, "Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on." Person: Bikini. This suggests that Iris wasn't wearing her magical hood, which is described in Evidence 6 as Iris's Hood, said to offer protection from evil spirits.

So, if Iris didn't have her hood on, that might relate to her not being protected, but how does that tie into the contradiction? Maybe if the hood was supposed to be on her, but she wasn't wearing it, leading to her being vulnerable or being seen as the killer.

Wait, let me re-examine. Testimony 5 says that when Bikini awoke, Mystic Ami (Iris) was stabbing Elise. So, according to this testimony, Iris is the murderer. However, Evidence 10 says that Shichishito has the suspect's fingerprints, which would be Iris's. But if Testimony 3 says she wasn't wearing her hood, maybe that's a detail that contradicts something else.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 10. If Testimony 5 says Iris stabbed Elise, but Evidence 10 says the suspect's fingerprints are on the sword, which would align with Iris being the suspect, so that might not be a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that Testimony 5 says that when Bikini awoke, Mystic Ami (Iris) was stabbing Elise, implying that the stabbing happened after Bikini fainted. But according to Evidence 11, the autopsy report says the time of death was 10-11 PM, and the crime photo (Evidence 13) shows the courtyard where Elise was murdered. The weather data (Evidence 7) shows lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The tracks photo (Evidence 14) shows a track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge.

Looking at the timeline, the crime happened around 10:45 PM. The autopsy report time is 10-11 PM, which fits. So, if Testimony 5 says that when Bikini awoke, Iris was stabbing Elise, that would mean the stabbing happened after 10:45 PM, but the autopsy report says the cause of death was a stab in the back, so the stabbing must have happened before 11 PM.

Wait, but the lightning struck at 10:45, and the body fell 10 feet after death. So, the stabbing would have happened around 10:45 PM, and then Elise fell after death. So, if Testimony 5 says that when Bikini awoke, Iris was stabbing Elise, that would mean the stabbing happened after 10:45 PM, which contradicts the evidence that the stabbing happened at 10:45 PM.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the evidence regarding the time of the stabbing. But the user wants a single pair, so perhaps it's between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11, which states the time of death.

Alternatively, maybe it's between Testimony 5 and Evidence 10 regarding the fingerprints. If Testimony 5 says Iris was stabbing Elise, then her fingerprints should be on the sword, which matches Evidence 10. So, maybe that's not the contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says Iris didn't have her hood on, but Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which is magical. If she wasn't wearing it, maybe that's a detail that's important, but I'm not sure how that contradicts.

Wait, perhaps the main contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the timeline in Evidence 11. If Testimony 5 says that when Bikini awoke, Iris was stabbing Elise, implying that the stabbing happened after Bikini fainted, which would be after 11 PM, but the evidence says it happened around 10:45 PM.

Therefore, the pair would be Testimony 5 and Evidence 11, because Testimony 5 suggests the stabbing happened after 11 PM, while Evidence 11 states it happened between 10-11 PM.

Alternatively, if the user is considering that the lightning struck at 10:45, and the body fell after death, then the stabbing must have happened around 10:45, so Testimony 5 is incorrect in implying it happened after 11 PM.

So, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11.
</think>

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts which testimony in this case. Let me go through everything step by step. 

First, I see that the user has provided a list of evidence and testimonies, and they want to know which pair contradicts each other. The previous examples they gave were about different evidence and testimonies conflicting. So, I need to look for a pair where one piece of evidence or character statement directly contradicts another.

Looking at the testimonies, I see that Testimony 5 says, "...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all..." This is from Person: Bikini. So, Bikini is suggesting that Iris might have used a snowmobile to throw the weapon into Eagle River.

Now, looking at the evidence, I see Evidence 14 is the Tracks Photo, which shows a track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. Also, Evidence 7 is the Weather Data, which mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Additionally, Evidence 16 is the Crystal Sphere found near Dusky Bridge with blood on it.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find a contradiction between a piece of evidence and a testimony. So, let's see. If Testimony 5 suggests Iris could have used a snowmobile, but the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows a track from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, which would mean someone walked there, not used a snowmobile. Also, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) mentions lightning at 10:45 PM near Dusky Bridge, and the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found there with blood.

But how does this relate to Testimony 5? If Iris couldn't have used a snowmobile because the track shows it was walked, then Testimony 5 might be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the time of the lightning strike affects this.

Wait, the lightning struck at 10:45 PM, and the Crystal Sphere was found near Dusky Bridge that night. If the murder happened around 10-11 PM, as per Elise's Autopsy Report (Evidence 11), then the lightning strike at 10:45 PM would have occurred just before the murder or during it. If Iris was in her room until the murder was discovered (Iris's Testimony, Evidence 12), then she might not have been using a snowmobile at that time.

But the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows a track leading to Dusky Bridge, implying someone walked there. If Iris drove a snowmobile, there should be a track, but the photo shows walking tracks instead. So, the Tracks Photo contradicts the idea that Iris used a snowmobile, which is mentioned in Testimony 5.

Therefore, Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) contradicts Testimony 5 (from Bikini) because the tracks indicate someone walked to Dusky Bridge, not used a snowmobile, which would have left different tracks.
</think>

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure this out. I'm looking at the evidence and testimonies provided, and I need to find which one contradicts the other. The user wants me to identify a pair where evidence and testimony directly oppose each other. 

First, I'll go through each testimony and see what it says. Testimony 2 from Butz says, "I didn't see a snowmobile!" But looking at the evidence, there's a Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) that shows a track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. This suggests that a snowmobile was indeed used that night. So, Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 14 because the testimony claims no snowmobile was seen, while the evidence shows tracks indicating a snowmobile was used.

I think that makes sense. The evidence directly contradicts the testimony because the track photo provides concrete proof of a snowmobile being present, which Butz didn't see. This seems like the correct pair to highlight the contradiction.
</think>

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 2}
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts which testimony here. Let me go through each piece of evidence and testimony step by step.

First, I see that there are several pieces of evidence listed from 0 to 21, and then testimonies from 0 to 6, each associated with a person, either "Bikini" or "Butz". The question is asking for a pair where one piece of evidence or character directly contradicts a testimony. The answer should be in JSON format, like {"evidence": x, "testimony": y} or {"character": x, "testimony": y}.

Looking at the testimonies first, I see that "Butz" was at a shack around 9 PM, which would mean he arrived at the scene around 10:30 PM. The evidence mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, and the fire started around then. Also, the weather data shows that the snow started around 7 PM, and the lightning strikes were between 10 to 11 PM.

Now, considering "Butz's" testimonies, he says he saw Dusky Bridge on fire and ran to check it out. But if he arrived at the shack around 9 PM, it would take him some time to reach the bridge, especially since it was snowing and there were lightning strikes. However, the evidence shows that the fire started around 10:45 PM, which is after he arrived. So, if he arrived at 10:30 PM, he would have seen the fire shortly after, but the evidence says the fire started at 10:45. That seems consistent.

Wait, but he also mentions that Nick showed up less than a minute after he arrived at the bridge. If the fire started at 10:45 PM, and he arrived at the bridge around 10:30 PM, then Nick arriving a minute later would make sense. But I need to check if there's any contradiction here.

Looking at the evidence again, the fire started around 10:45 PM, and the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45. So, if Butz arrived at the bridge around 10:30 PM, he would have seen the fire starting at 10:45 PM. But the testimony says he looked out the window and saw Dusky Bridge on fire, which would be around 10:30 PM, but the evidence says the fire started at 10:45. That's a discrepancy.

Wait, no, the testimony doesn't specify the exact time he saw the fire. It just says he saw it burning. So, if he arrived at the bridge around 10:30 PM, he would have seen the fire starting around 10:45 PM. That fits with the evidence. So, maybe there's no contradiction here.

Alternatively, looking at another testimony, he says he was at the shack around 9 PM, which would mean he arrived at the bridge around 10:30 PM. The evidence says the lightning struck at 10:45 PM, so the fire would have started then. But he saw the fire, which aligns with the evidence.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about another pair. Perhaps the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Butz says he didn't see a snowmobile, but the Tracks Photo indicates that a snowmobile was used, that could be a contradiction.

Wait, no, the Tracks Photo is evidence that supports the use of a snowmobile, while Butz's testimony says he didn't see a snowmobile. So, that would be a contradiction between the Tracks Photo and Butz's testimony.

Alternatively, looking at the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16), which was found near Dusky Bridge with blood on it. Butz didn't mention anything about it in his testimonies. Maybe that's not relevant.

Going back, the Tracks Photo shows tracks indicating a snowmobile was used, but Butz's testimony says he didn't see a snowmobile. That seems like a clear contradiction.

So, the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) contradicts Butz's testimony (Testimony 2), where he says he didn't see a snowmobile.

Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 2.
</think>

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 2}
<think>
Alright, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a list of evidence and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where one contradicts the other. The final answer should be in JSON format, specifying either evidence and testimony or character and testimony that contradict each other.

First, I'll go through the testimonies one by one and see what each one is saying. Then, I'll check the evidence related to each testimony to see if there's any contradiction.

Starting with Testimony 0: "I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?" Person: Butz. This testimony is pretty vague. It just states that Butz is an artist and was doing something, but doesn't specify what. So, I need to find evidence that relates to what Butz was doing that night.

Testimony 1: "Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!" Person: Butz. This testimony indicates that Butz was sketching near the bridge. So, looking for evidence that supports or contradicts this.

Testimony 2: "I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!" Person: Butz. This suggests that Butz saw Iris with her hood flying, which might imply Iris was moving quickly or perhaps involved in some supernatural activity.

Testimony 3: "The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!" Person: Butz. This seems to link Butz's emotional state to his art, implying he was sketching during the event.

Testimony 4: "...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up." Person: Butz. This suggests that after the fire at Dusky Bridge went out, someone (probably Nick) came running up.

Now, looking at the evidence:

Evidence 15: Larry's Sketch. Description: Horrible sketch of what he saw the night of the crime. Click here for details. This directly relates to Testimony 1 and 3, as Larry was sketching what he saw, which includes the bridge fire.

Evidence 14: Tracks Photo. Description: Taken that night. One track is shown leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. This supports the idea that someone, likely Nick, used a snowmobile to get to the bridge quickly.

Evidence 7: Weather Data. It mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, around the time of the fire.

Evidence 21: Dusky Bridge Photo. Taken the morning after the crime, showing the bridge after the fire.

Now, considering the testimonies:

Testimony 4 mentions that after the flames went out, someone came running up. The Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows a track from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, indicating that someone, possibly Nick, used a snowmobile to get there quickly. This aligns with Testimony 4, suggesting that Nick was present and left after the fire.

However, Testimony 2 states that Butz saw Iris flying with her hood, which might imply she was involved in the crime. Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, described as magical and meant to protect from evil spirits. If Iris was at the scene, perhaps using her hood, it could relate to Testimony 2.

But looking at the initial question, I need to find a contradiction between evidence and testimony or character and testimony.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 6. Testimony 2 says Butz saw Iris flying with her hood, which suggests she was present and active that night. Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which is supposed to offer protection. If Iris was using her hood that night, it might have been for protection, not necessarily flying. Alternatively, if she wasn't using it, that could create a contradiction.

Alternatively, considering the time frame: Evidence 11, Elise's Autopsy Report, states the murder occurred between 10-11 PM. Testimony 12, Iris's Testimony, says she rang the bell at 10 PM and stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. So, she was in her room from 10 PM onwards. Therefore, she couldn't have been at the bridge at 10:45 PM, as per the lightning strike in Evidence 7. This would create a contradiction between Testimony 12 and Evidence 7.

But the question is asking for a pair where evidence and testimony or character and testimony contradict. So, focusing on Testimony 2 and Evidence 6: Testimony 2 says Butz saw Iris flying with her hood, implying she was present. Evidence 6 is her hood, which might have been used that night, possibly for protection or another purpose. If Butz saw her using the hood, it aligns with Evidence 6. But if the hood wasn't used that night, it contradicts.

Alternatively, considering the timing: If Iris was in her room from 10 PM (Testimony 12), she couldn't have been at the bridge at 10:45 PM (Evidence 7). So, Testimony 12 and Evidence 7 contradict because Iris couldn't have been both in her room and at the bridge at the same time.

But the question is about a pair, so I think the intended answer is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 14. Testimony 2 says Butz saw Iris flying, but Evidence 14 shows tracks indicating someone (likely Nick) was at the bridge, not Iris. So, if Butz saw Iris at the bridge, but the tracks indicate Nick, that's a contradiction.

Wait, no, because Testimony 2 is about Butz seeing Iris, not about the tracks. The tracks are from Evidence 14.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14. Testimony 4 says someone (Nick) came running up after the fire, which matches the tracks in Evidence 14. So, they support each other, not contradict.

Another angle: Testimony 5 mentions Nick showing up less than a minute after Butz arrived at the bridge. But if the tracks indicate someone was there before, it could create a contradiction.

I think the key contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 14. Testimony 2 says Butz saw Iris flying, but Evidence 14 shows that Nick was at the bridge, not Iris. So, if Butz saw Iris, but the evidence shows Nick, that's a contradiction.

But wait, Testimony 2 is about Butz seeing Iris, not about the bridge. So, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 6. Testimony 2 says Iris was flying, which would mean she was at the bridge, but Evidence 6 is her hood, which was found near the bridge, implying she might have been there. However, if she was in her room (Testimony 12), she couldn't have been at the bridge. So, the contradiction is between Testimony 12 and Evidence 7 (lightning strike at 10:45 PM), as she couldn't have been both places at the same time.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts is Testimony 12 (Iris's testimony about being in her room) and Evidence 7 (weather data indicating the lightning strike at 10:45 PM, around the time of the murder). This is because if Iris was in her room until the murder was discovered, she couldn't have been present at the bridge during the lightning strike and murder.

So, the JSON answer would be {"evidence": 7, "testimony": 12}.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 12}

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character's testimony contradicts each other based on the information provided. 

First, I'll go through each testimony and see what details they provide. Then, I'll check the evidence related to those details to see if there's a contradiction.

Starting with Testimony 0: "When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone..." Person: Butz. So, Butz arrived at Dusky Bridge after Elise was already gone. 

Looking at the evidence, Evidence 14 is the Tracks Photo, which shows a track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. This suggests that someone arrived at Dusky Bridge, but if Butz arrived after Elise was gone, maybe the track is from someone else.

Evidence 14 is Tracks Photo, which indicates someone was there before Butz. So, if Butz arrived after Elise, the track might be from Elise or someone else, but the time might not align. However, the key point is that Elise was already gone when Butz arrived.

Now, looking at Testimony 2: "That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow!" Person: Butz. This suggests that Butz found the crystal sphere at Dusky Bridge after Elise was gone.

Looking at Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere, which was found near Dusky Bridge with blood on it. This supports Testimony 2, indicating that the crystal sphere was indeed found there. 

But then, Testimony 3 says: "I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood." Person: Butz. This implies that Iris was wearing her hood when she was at Dusky Bridge, but Evidence 5 (Photo of Elise) shows Elise wearing a white robe and a hood. However, Evidence 9 (Victim's Staff) mentions that the staff had a crystal sphere, but it's not attached now. 

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and the evidence about the crystal sphere. If Iris was wearing a hood, but the crystal sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, perhaps there's a discrepancy in timing or ownership. Alternatively, the testimony might be conflicting with another evidence.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 3 says Iris was wearing a spare hood, but the crystal sphere was found near Dusky Bridge. If Iris lost her hood, but the crystal sphere is linked to Elise, maybe there's a mix-up. Or perhaps the crystal sphere was Elise's, not Iris's, so if Iris was wearing a hood, that doesn't explain the crystal sphere.

Alternatively, maybe the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows a track leading to Dusky Bridge, indicating someone arrived there, but if Elise was already gone, perhaps the timing contradicts the Tracks Photo's time. The Weather Data (Evidence 7) shows lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, around the time of the crime. If Elise was murdered around 10-11 PM, and Butz arrived after, the track might not align.

Wait, but the Tracks Photo was taken that night, showing a track leading to Dusky Bridge. If Elise was killed around 10-11 PM, and Butz arrived after, the track might have been made by someone else, like the murderer, which could support the Tracks Photo as evidence of the suspect's presence.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline:

- Testimony 0: Butz arrived at Dusky Bridge after Elise was gone.
- Testimony 2: Butz found the crystal sphere there.
- Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere was found near Dusky Bridge with blood, supporting Testimony 2.
- Testimony 3: Butz thinks Iris was wearing a spare hood, implying she was present.
- Evidence 5: Elise was wearing a hood in her photo, but her staff (Evidence 9) didn't have a crystal sphere, which was found separately (Evidence 16).

So, if Iris was wearing a hood, but the crystal sphere was Elise's, perhaps Testimony 3 is incorrect because the crystal sphere wasn't with Iris. Or maybe the timing is off because Elise was already gone when Butz arrived.

Alternatively, the contradiction might be between Testimony 3 and the Tracks Photo. If Butz saw tracks leading to Dusky Bridge, indicating someone was there before him, but he arrived after Elise was gone, the tracks might belong to the murderer, not Iris.

Wait, but the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows a track leading to Dusky Bridge, which could mean the murderer arrived there, leading to the crime. If Butz arrived later, the tracks would support that the murderer was there earlier.

So, perhaps Testimony 3 is incorrect because it suggests Iris was at Dusky Bridge, but the Tracks Photo and the timeline suggest the murderer was there, not Iris.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 16. If Iris was wearing a hood, but the crystal sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, maybe Iris didn't have the crystal sphere, so Testimony 3 is incorrect.

Wait, but the crystal sphere was part of Elise's staff (Evidence 5), which was found separately (Evidence 16). So, if Iris was wearing a hood, but the crystal sphere was Elise's, Testimony 3 might be trying to mislead by suggesting Iris was there, but the evidence points to Elise or the murderer.

I think the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 and the Tracks Photo. Testimony 3 suggests Iris was at Dusky Bridge wearing a hood, but the Tracks Photo shows someone arrived there before Butz, likely the murderer, not Iris. Therefore, Testimony 3 contradicts the Tracks Photo evidence.

Alternatively, considering the time: Lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 (Evidence 7), and the murder occurred around 10-11 PM (Evidence 11). If Butz arrived after the murder, the Tracks Photo would show the murderer's tracks, not Iris's. So, Testimony 3 is incorrect because it places Iris at Dusky Bridge, but the evidence shows the murderer was there earlier.

So, the pair that contradicts would be Testimony 3 and Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo). Alternatively, since the user's previous answer linked Testimony 2 with Evidence 14, maybe the current answer should be different.

Wait, in the previous answer, it was Testimony 2 and Evidence 14. But in this case, the user's last question had multiple testimonies and the answer was {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 2}. Now, perhaps the correct answer is different.

After reconsidering, I think the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 14. Testimony 3 says Iris was at Dusky Bridge, but Evidence 14 shows tracks indicating someone arrived there, likely the murderer, not Iris. Therefore, the pair would be Testimony 3 and Evidence 14.

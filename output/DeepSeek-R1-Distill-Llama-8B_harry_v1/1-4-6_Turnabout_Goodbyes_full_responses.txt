Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let me start by going through all the evidence and testimonies one by one to see where there's a conflict.

First, I see that Evidence 10 is a Pistol, which is the murder weapon. It's a 22-caliber and has Edgeworth's right hand prints. That seems important because it directly ties Edgeworth to the murder. Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 5 says that after Edgeworth threw something at Yogi, there was a single gunshot and a scream. Testimony 6 mentions a terrible scream that the person remembers to this day.

So, putting this together, if Edgeworth threw something, then a gunshot happened, and there was a scream. The evidence shows that Edgeworth fired the pistol three times, which would mean multiple shots. However, the testimony only mentions a single gunshot after that event. That seems contradictory because the evidence suggests there were three shots, but the testimony only accounts for one. That might be the contradiction here.

Alternatively, I should check other testimonies to make sure. Testimony 5 says a single gunshot and a scream. If the evidence says three shots, that would mean either the testimony is missing details, or the evidence is incorrect. But since the evidence directly points to Edgeworth as the shooter with three shots, the testimony only mentioning one might be a discrepancy.

Wait, but the testimonies are from Edgeworth's perspective, so maybe the person is recounting only what they heard. But the evidence is concrete, showing three shots. So that could be a contradiction because the testimony only mentions one shot, but the evidence says three were fired. That seems like a direct contradiction.

I don't see any other contradictions immediately. For example, the other testimonies don't directly conflict with the evidence. So, the main point is that the testimony only mentions one shot, but the evidence says three, which is a conflict.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are:

**Evidence 10 (Pistol) and Testimony 5 (Edgeworth).**

**Explanation:**
Evidence 10 indicates that the murder weapon was fired three times, which would mean three shots. However, Testimony 5 from Edgeworth states that after an incident, there was only a single gunshot followed by a scream. This discrepancy arises because the testimony accounts for only one shot, whereas the evidence supports three, suggesting a contradiction in the number of shots fired.

Present Magic Show Ticket Apollo: Leads to: \"Those magicians you liked, was it this bunch!?\" Apollo: (The red envelope came after she'd completed her first \"job\"... That makes it a letter from her client... whoever wanted a forgery made.) Trucy: Apollo...! Apollo: We're close. We just have to piece together the parts: A deadly weapon in a red envelope... ...and the path it took to take Drew Misham's life. Apollo: Those magicians you liked, was it this bunch!? Vera: ...... Trucy: Apollo! They're not a \"bunch\"! Judge: Hmm... I see! Still, I have to wonder. Why include a commemorative stamp like that in a business letter? Apollo: Good question! Trucy: Well, pretty stamps are always better, and you can't beat Troupe Gramarye! Judge: But, the whole murder plan was a failure because of it. Ironic, don't you think. ...Prosecutor Gavin?

Klavier: In your testimony just now, you stated... ...this was your \"first work that was other than a painting\". Vera: ...... Klavier: Please, tell me... ...what exactly did you make? Vera: ...... ...Can I ask why-- Klavier: No! Answer the question! ...Now! Vera: Eeeeeeeeeek! Judge: P-Prosecutor Gavin...? You're usually not the one whose volume concerns me. Klavier: ...Yes, it is unbecoming of me. I apologize. But... I must know. Please, Ms. Misham, tell me. Vera: ...... ...It was... a book... ...A single page... In a \"book\"... Klavier: A \"book\"...? Please be more specific. Vera: ...... ...It was a handwritten book. Like... Like a diary... Klavier: ...... Nnnno! I don't... No!!! Trucy: Wh-What's wrong with Prosecutor Gavin?

Apollo: Apollo: ...Prosecutor Gavin! The defendant is answering all of your questions! Stop badgering her! Klavier: ...... He's told you nothing, has he? ...Your soiled, sullied mentor. Nothing!? Apollo: Sullied... who? Klavier: Phoenix Wright. Who else!? Trucy: ...Daddy? Klavier: He never told you about the trial, seven years ago? About how he came to lose his attorney's badge... Apollo: ...! Klavier: It was a certain piece of evidence that decided his fate, you know. ...A certain diary. On the back, it bore the mark of a silk hat. Apollo: ...Whaaaaaat!? (Phoenix Wright, tossed out of the profession by false evidence... And the forger who made that evidence... ...is this girl standing right in front of me!?) Vera! You must tell us!

Examiner's diagnosis: Acute atroquinine poisoning. ...This ends the recording of the trial for the murder of Drew Misham. Vera Misham was, during the trial, poisoned by an unknown assailant. The dosage was just under the lethal amount, sparing the defendant's life. She is currently in intensive care, and is not to be disturbed for any reason. ...A very simple case, at first glance... ...until it finally began to show its true colors. The long road to the truth takes us to the record of another trial. In some ways, that was the starting point of it all. And that is where we must go... ...to find the whole truth. To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Justice. Apollo: (Ugh. I must be on the wrong track...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Apollo: ...Um... You sure about that? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Justice! Apollo: (Ack! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Apollo: They aren't, are they...? Judge: Not at all. Mr. Justice, please think the facts over before making accusations. Apollo: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Apollo: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: ...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Justice. Objection overruled.

Brushel: Yooooooooooooooooooowrk! Dontyellallofasuddenlikethat! You'll give a guy a heart attack... Apollo: Ack! Sorry! It's just... the way you were moving just now. It was particularly suspicious. Brushel: What's that supposed to mean!? So usually I'm just sort of \"averagely\" suspicious? Apollo: ...Sorry. My mistake. You're fine. (I know I'm on to something here. Time to focus!) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims!

It seems I've found the partner I've been looking for all along....Over a game of cards?Why, yes. Over a game of cards.Phoenix: That was how we first met. ...Seven years ago.-- Seven Years Earlier --Phoenix Wright's Final TrialApril 19, 9:27 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Examine evidence Attorney's Badge Back side Phoenix: Each attorney's badge has a number engraved on the back. No two numbers are the same. So if you drop it, people will know it was you. Better make sure I don't lose mine.Phoenix: (Whew, OK. It's been a long time since I've felt like such a rookie. Got to try and relax.) Ah, good morning, Mr. Enigmar.Enigmar: I'm... sorry to have sprung this on you so suddenly.Phoenix: I received the files from your previous attorney only yesterday. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure I'm prepared.Enigmar: ...I understand I am asking the impossible of you.Phoenix: Yes, well, you haven't really told me what happened yet! All we did... was play cards.Enigmar: And that was enough.Phoenix: (Actually, it wasn't. Trust me.)???: Ooh! Morning, Daddy!Enigmar: Ah, I'm so glad you came.???: You OK, Daddy? They picking on you?Enigmar: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I am fine, as always. This old boy is here to help me, after all.Phoenix: (That's \"young man\" to you.) Good morning. That's a cute outfit you have on.???: Thanks! My first show's today, after all!Phoenix: Oh, I'm sure it is! (What the heck is she talking about?)???: Oh... Old boy!Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Look what he's started.)???: Um, uh... Here.Phoenix: What's this...????: I dunno! I just got it over there in the hall. They told me to give it to the \"old boy in the blue suit with the spiky hair\". They said it was really important!Enigmar: ...What's this? A memo for you or some such?Phoenix: Hmm... Not from the looks of it. (What is this? Looks like a page from someone's diary.) I'll give it a read later.Notebook Page added to the Court Record.Enigmar: Well, how do you feel about the trial today?Phoenix: We'll get through it. Somehow. Incidentally... the prosecutor today is a new guy, I hear.Enigmar: Ah... An easy win, then, yes?Phoenix: They're calling him a \"true thoroughbred in the history of the prosecutor's office\". ...Of course, there's one of those every year.Enigmar: ...The switching of attorneys just before the trial... ...I know it is a difficult situation I put you in. But... allow me to say one thing, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: ...Yes?Enigmar: They will not be able to pronounce me guilty today. So, do your best, but do not worry.Phoenix: (First time a defendant's ever given me a pep speech...) I'll do what I can.Enigmar: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I see you do not understand. You see, it will be impossible for them to declare a verdict.Phoenix: I-Impossible?Enigmar: Yes. Isn't that right, Trucy?Trucy: Yup! You bet, Daddy.Phoenix: (My first look at the case was only yesterday. And the information I was given was a tad bit lacking, to be honest. Still, I'll do what I can. ...For their sake.)Enigmar: I believe the curtains will be lifting any time now. I am in your capable hands, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: My client is Shadi Enigmar. Known to the world as Zak Gramarye. A wildly popular magician, star of Troupe Gramarye. His mentor, Magnifi Gramarye, was a rare breed of magician. He single-handedly ushered in a golden age of stage magic... until he was shot dead. And Zak Gramarye is the suspect.April 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Shadi Enigmar.Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor.???: ......Judge: Is the prosecution ready????: I was just thinking, is this what all the fuss is about? Bit of a buzz-kill, really.Judge: \"Buzz-kill\"...? Is this some new kind of crime????: One of the worst. This is a trial, ja? Where are the sweaty palms? The pounding hearts? A Gavinners concert's got ten times the thrill this gig's got.Judge: Who... were you, again?Klavier: Klavier. Klavier Gavin. I came... to get the party started. Legally, ja?Judge: Gavin? Defense Attorney Kristoph Gavin's...?Klavier: Ah, figures my bro's more famous in this part of town.Phoenix: (Klavier Gavin... Lead singer for the megahit band, the Gavinners. You're out of your league, rock-boy.)Klavier: I know what you're thinking: \"You're out of your league, rock-boy.\"Phoenix: ......Klavier: True, my debut single, \"13 Years Hard Time for Love\", went platinum overnight... ...but that's just a hobby to me compared to this, ja?Phoenix: ...Talkative, aren't you? I like your affected Euro-rock accent, by the way.Klavier: I'm just getting warmed up, Herr Attorney Wright.Judge: Perhaps you would be so kind as to fill us in on the case?Klavier: ...Achtung, baby. Time to call on the opening act. ...What was his name again? Ah yes... Detective Gumshoe! Hit it!Klavier: ...And you are?Gumshoe: Hey, you were the one who called me up here... sir. Name's Dick Gumshoe. I'm a homicide detective down at the precinct.Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe... Long time no see.)Gumshoe: Hey, you!Phoenix: H-Huh? Me?Gumshoe: Today's the day, pal. Today, I win, and you lose! I got confidence in my testimony today, see.Phoenix: (What, you normally lack confidence in your testimony...?)Klavier: ...Herr Detective, this is my stage. Can the antics.Gumshoe: Huh...?Klavier: All this \"hey you\"-ing and such. And I could care less about your history together.Gumshoe: Urk.Judge: ...Very well, Detective Gumshoe, if you would. Please tell us about the case at hand.Gumshoe: It happened six days back, in a room at the General Hospital! The facts are as simple as they come. Here's the crime scene. The victim was a patient, asleep in a hospital bed. The killer comes in, puts a pistol to his forehead, and bam. Lights out. ...Them's the facts.Judge: Hmm... Not so long ago, the victim, Magnifi Gramarye was a famous man. He had the entire country under his \"magical spell\", as it were.Klavier: Ah yes, the great magician. He retired years ago, though. Say the name \"Magnifi\" to one of my generation... and you'd be lucky to get a blank stare.Judge: Yes, though I'm sure the youngsters today know his disciples even better. I daresay Troupe Gramarye has made quite a name for themselves.Gumshoe: Anyhow, the retired Magnifi's been in the hospital for the last year. Hmm, what was it? A mall-ignorant tutor or something. Doing something to his liver, I think. Yeah.Judge: A \"malignant tumor\", perhaps?Klavier: In other words, he had liver cancer. He had only three months left to live, in fact.Magnifi's Chart added to the Court Record.Judge: Hmm... The facts do seem simple enough. But... something's not right.Klavier: ...The victim was already climbing a three-month stairway to heaven. ...Why not wait for him to knock-knock-knock on heaven's door? Why shoot him?Phoenix: (I wouldn't have put it quite so lyrically, but it's true. Why make the effort to commit murder when the victim was about to die?)Gumshoe: Incidentally, the victim had a serious case of diabetes.Phoenix: Diabetes?Klavier: In fact, he was about to \"shoot up\" with insulin... ...when he was shot with a pistol. The syringe was found at the crime scene. Chronic diabetes... and cancer. As much as it pains me to say it... ...the victim was clearly at the end of his life.Small Syringe added to the Court Record.Examine evidence Small Syringe Syringe barrel Phoenix: ...I always hated getting shots. I guess Magnifi was giving himself the insulin shots... There's no way I could do that... *shudder* ...! Wait! If Magnifi used this to inject his insulin... ...why are there no traces of it having been used? Hmm... Something to keep in mind.Judge: Hmm... I believe the question before us is clear, then. Why did the killer have to shoot this dying man? What reason could he have had?Klavier: ...Very well, Detective. Perhaps you can enlighten us as to the circumstances of the shooting.Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- The Circumstances --Gumshoe: Actually... the victim kind of ordered the defendant to do him in. A few days before it happened, the victim sent a letter \"ordering\" his own murder. The defendant did what was asked of him, and shot the old man in the forehead! The bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, no doubt about it. And the pistol definitely belonged to the old man, sir!Judge: Wh-Whaaat!? You're saying the victim ordered his own shooting?Klavier: Those are the facts. I have here the letter in question.Magnifi's Letter added to the Court Record.Judge: ...Very unusual, indeed! Although, could such a thing as a letter really cause one to pull a trigger, I wonder?Klavier: I believe the answer to that question can be found at the end of the letter.Judge: Ah... \"You cannot refuse, and we both know the reason why.\" Detective Gumshoe, can you explain this to the court?Gumshoe: Unfortunately, even the defendant won't say a peep about that bit, sir.Phoenix: One thing bothers me about this. Why didn't he just say \"11\"? Why have him come at \"11:05\" without some specific reason...?Klavier: The devil is in the details, Herr Attorney...Judge: Well? Was there some reason?Klavier: As it turns out, there was. Every night, for a half hour, starting at 11:00... ...the victim, Magnifi Gramarye, was given an IV.Phoenix: An IV...?Judge: There it is in the picture, off to the side of the bed.Klavier: At 11:00, a doctor would come to set up the IV. Thirty minutes later, he would come back for the empty bag. This happened every night, without fail.Phoenix: So that was the only time they could meet without the chance of an untimely interruption. ...During his IV.Judge: Very well, shall we begin? ...Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, if you would!Phoenix: (What's this \"reason he couldn't refuse\", I wonder? He could have at least mentioned it to me...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Circumstances --Gumshoe: Actually... the victim kind of ordered the defendant to do him in.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Just because he got the letter doesn't mean he went through with it! Klavier: Oh? I disagree. The victim was, indeed, shot in the forehead, after all. Just as he had commanded. Phoenix: It could be a set-up. But let's not be in such a hurry. Maybe we should let the witness talk for a change. Gumshoe: ...Thanks, pal. Klavier: ...... Fine. I can play it slow as well as I can play it fast. On with the testimony, Detective Gumshoe.Gumshoe: A few days before it happened, the victim sent a letter \"ordering\" his own murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...And this letter was sent by the victim? Gumshoe: There it is! Gotcha! You're all mine this time, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: I had the handwriting checked out, of course. It's the victim's, no mistake! Phoenix: Ah, I see... Gumshoe: Ha ha ha ha ha! Score one for the boys! Phoenix: (I didn't \"lose\". I was just ascertaining the facts. ...So why am I so annoyed?) Judge: But... a letter ordering your own death? Things aren't what they used to be, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure this is exactly \"commonplace\", even now, Your Honor. Gumshoe: ...So anyway, guess I'll keep going while I'm ahead!Gumshoe: The defendant did what was asked of him, and shot the old man in the forehead!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...How can you be so sure!? Gumshoe: Hey, you gotta learn to stop relying on people to do your thinking for you, pal. Learn to think for yourself! Get that noggin cranking! Phoenix: (You fail to grasp the concept of \"questioning\", detective.) Gumshoe: First, we got this letter. It says \"shoot... in the forehead\" loud and clear. Phoenix: I can see that. But I still wouldn't do it. Gumshoe: Well, maybe you need to grow yourself a backbone, pal. Phoenix: (You fail to grasp the concept of \"shooting people is bad\", detective.) Gumshoe: We also found the defendant's pistol at the scene. Klavier: Traces of gunpowder residue shows that it had been fired recently. Judge: ...Well, Mr. Wright? As far as I can tell from looking at this photo... ...there seems to be no issue with the prosecution's claim. Phoenix: (The photo... Maybe there's something in there I can use. So they're saying the defendant \"shot the victim in the forehead\"? I think there's a hole in the prosecution's argument! Clearly, Mr. Enigmar...) I have no clue. Phoenix: Unfortunately, nothing in this picture suggests he didn't do it. Judge: Ah, I see. That is unfortunate. Phoenix: ...Huh? Klavier: Well, let's pay it no mind and carry on, shall we? I like a fast tempo. Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: Hey, I still got stuff to talk about, pal! Phoenix: (...Everyone's so eager to move on. So of course, I want to slow down. ...Is there really not a single clue in this picture?) Judge: Back to the testimony, if you would, detective. Leads back to cross-examination didn't pull the trigger. Phoenix: People don't normally commit murder just because their teacher told them to. Which means the defendant didn't fire that pistol! Klavier: Klavier: ...This is your position, then? Phoenix: Um, well, yes. Klavier: This is the sort of occasion when my brother would present some \"evidence\". Phoenix: ...Ah. Klavier: Did you have some evidence you wanted to show us? Something proving it wasn't the defendant who shot the old man? Phoenix: ...... ...... Judge: Penalty for excessive perspiration, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (But it's a cold sweat, Your Honor...) Leads back to cross-examination shot something else. Phoenix: Looking at this photo, another possibility occurs to me. Judge: Yes...? Phoenix: What does the letter tell us? That the defendant had a \"reason he couldn't refuse\" his teacher's wishes. Gumshoe: Bingo, pal! That's why the defendant popped him one in the forehead! Phoenix: Oh? The defense disagrees. You see, the defendant had another choice he could make. Klavier: Klavier: What, and you can prove that with this photo!? Phoenix: ...I can prove he had a choice, yes. Judge: \"The defendant might have fired, like he was ordered. But he didn't shoot the victim's forehead.\" Well, let's hear what you're thinking, Mr. Wright. If he didn't shoot the victim's forehead, what did the defendant shoot? Present clown doll's forehead Phoenix: Judge: The clown doll...? Phoenix: Take a closer look. See? It's been shot in the forehead, too. Judge: Ah...! There's a hole in its forehead! Phoenix: Yes, and a hole in the prosecution's claim! Klavier: Klavier: Hah! And I suppose you have a reason as to why he'd shoot the clown doll? Phoenix: He didn't just shoot the doll. He shot the doll's forehead. Klavier: His \"forehead\"...? Aah...! Phoenix: Let's read the \"orders\" once more, shall we? \"...You will shoot, one shot, square in the forehead.\" ...Which is exactly what he did. He shot the clown doll square in the forehead! Judge: The defense has raised an intriguing possibility. That hole in the clown's forehead... It definitely looks like it was shot! Bailiff! Send someone to investigate this matter! Klavier: Klavier: I admit, I'm impressed. But I expected nothing less. Still, this doesn't mean he didn't shoot the victim! Phoenix: Phoenix: Perhaps he did have to shoot a forehead, as ordered. But the letter says nothing about whose forehead... This was the only way he had to follow his orders without taking a life! Judge: Hmm. The bullet hole in the clown doll's forehead does demand an explanation. It might very well be a clue. Yet Prosecutor Gavin is right. It alone does not prove the defendant's innocence. You cannot say for sure the defendant didn't shoot the victim. Klavier: So sorry, Mr. Wright. How sad it is to see the mighty fall. Phoenix: (...How sad it is to see the novice's overconfidence. He doesn't realize just how big this little \"hole\" is going to get.) Judge: ...Detective Gumshoe. Please take this new-found fact into account as you continue your testimony. Adds statement \"So what if he shot the clown? He still shot the victim, pal!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Ah... I see! Which is to say... ...I have no idea what you're talking about. Prosecutor Gavin? Klavier: The defendant had a choice other than shooting the victim in the forehead? ...Perhaps I might suggest one. He could have shot this attorney in the forehead! Phoenix: ...Urk! Judge: Ah... I see. Which is to say... ...I still don't see. Still, when in doubt, give a penalty, I always say. Phoenix: (Ugh. Time to think this one through again.) Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: But... it might have been the clown's forehead he shot. Gumshoe: OK, so he practiced first on the doll, then shot him! Phoenix: He \"practiced\" in the middle of the hospital? Anyone could have come in at any moment! Gumshoe: Yeah, but no one did come, did they, pal? Besides, it's what I woulda done. \"Always look before you shoot,\" I say. Klavier: ...Might I suggest we move on? This is getting us nowhere. Phoenix: (Patience. We'll get there sooner than you think.) Judge: Very well. Please continue with your testimony, detective.Gumshoe: The bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, no doubt about it.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean this pistol, the one in the crime scene photo? Gumshoe: ...That's the one! It's a funny-looking gun so there's no mistaking it. Klavier: We compared the bullet taken from the victim's skull with a bullet fired from this gun. The rifling marks on the bullets were a perfect match. Phoenix: So... you verified the murder weapon, in other words. Gumshoe: You bet we did!Press (after pressing fifth statement, before Stage Pistol is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean this pistol, the one in the crime scene photo? Gumshoe: ...That's the one! It's a funny-looking gun so there's no mistaking it. Klavier: We compared the bullet taken from the victim's skull with a bullet fired from this gun. The rifling marks on the bullets were a perfect match. Phoenix: So... you verified the murder weapon, in other words. Gumshoe: You bet we did! Judge: ...The court would like to see the pistol in question. Gumshoe: You got it, sir! Here she is! Judge: Well. This truly is a \"blast\" from the past. Gumshoe: It's a stage pistol for magic shows, see. But it can fire real bullets. Judge: Hmm. It looks so much bigger in real life than on TV. Gumshoe: Yeah, but it can only hold one round. ...By the way, the pistol's firing chamber is empty. ...And it shows traces of having been fired recently. Phoenix: So... were any fingerprints found on the gun? Klavier: ...Unfortunately, no. Of course, the defendant is known for wearing gloves. We might say that a lack of fingerprints is, in fact, a \"fingerprint\" of its own. Judge: Ah ha! Intriguing point, well made! Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! Not well made! Not intriguing! Judge: In any case, the court accepts this evidence. Stage Pistol added to the Court Record. Judge: ...My grandchild would get a kick out of seeing this. ...But now it's time to return to our testimony.Examine evidence Stage Pistol Chamber Phoenix: If you look closely, you can see how the pistol's made to bend here. It's a one-shot model, and I guess this bend is where you load it. So... this is the famous Gramarye Golden Sun. They say kids used to love pretending they had one of those. I wonder if they pretended to miss their targets, too?Gumshoe: And the pistol definitely belonged to the old man, sir!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Why are you so certain? Gumshoe: What pile of sand has your head been stuck in all this time, pal? You never heard of \"Zak & Valant's Quick-Draw Shootem\"? Phoenix: Huh? What's that? Gumshoe: One of the defendant's specialties. Zak and Valant stand on either side of a girl! Then, they shoot! But the bullets don't hit her! Instead, they hit everything else on stage!!! This was one of the pistols they used in their show. Got a great design, huh? The kids love it. Klavier: Many boys and girls joined the police because of that pistol, I hear. Phoenix: (You know, that would explain a lot about the police force.) Gumshoe: Troupe Gramarye stopped doing that act a while ago. The old man held on to that pistol ever since.Press (after pressing fourth statement, before Stage Pistol is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Why are you so certain?

Phoenix: So... were any fingerprints found on the gun? Klavier: ...Unfortunately, no. Of course, the defendant is known for wearing gloves. We might say that a lack of fingerprints is, in fact, a \"fingerprint\" of its own. Judge: Ah ha! Intriguing point, well made! Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! Not well made! Not intriguing! Judge: In any case, the court accepts this evidence. Stage Pistol added to the Court Record. Judge: ...My grandchild would get a kick out of seeing this. ...But now it's time to return to our testimony.Gumshoe: So what if he shot the clown? He still shot the victim, pal!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So let me get this straight. You're saying my client first shot the clown, then shot the victim? Gumshoe: Hey! Not a bad summary, pal! Phoenix: (More of a confirmation than a summary, but whatever.) Klavier: That was really more of a confirmation than a summary. But our defense attorney seems pleased enough with himself. Phoenix: (Do these people ever miss a chance to mock me?) Klavier: Well, now that Mr. Wright's gotten that out of his system... ...shall we continue with the testimony?Present Stage Pistol Phoenix: Leads to: \"The trickiest cases often seem the simplest.\"Phoenix: (...I didn't have time to gather all the details before coming in here.

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the provided story, characters, evidences, and testimonies.\n\nFirst, let me recap the key points from the story. The main focus here is on the trial involving Vera Misham and the poisoning of Drew Misham. During the cross-examination, Vera mentions a commemorative stamp that was a picture of her favorite magicians, which she kept. Later, when Apollo presses her about the magicians, she talks about a magic troupe she saw as a child that disbanded. Apollo presents the Magic Show Ticket, leading to the revelation that the stamp depicted Troupe Gramarye. This connects to Klavier Gavin realizing that the forged diary used in Phoenix Wright's trial seven years ago was created by Vera, and the stamp was sent by the client who commissioned the forgery.\n\nNow, looking at the testimonies and evidences. The testimonies listed are from Gumshoe in the earlier trial about Magnifi's murder. But maybe there's a testimony in the current case that contradicts an evidence. Wait, the user provided testimonies labeled Testimony 0 to 5, all from Gumshoe about the circumstances of Magnifi's murder. However, the story also includes Vera's testimonies during Apollo's trial. Wait, the testimonies given here are all from Gumshoe in the past trial, but the main contradiction in the current case might be from Vera's testimony about the stamp and the evidence related to it.\n\nWait, the user might have mixed the testimonies. Let me check the provided data again. The testimonies listed are from Gumshoe in the earlier trial (Phoenix's part). But the current trial's testimonies (Apollo's part) include Vera's statements about the stamp being her favorite magicians, which is Troupe Gramarye. The evidence \"Commemorative Stamp\" (Evidence 28) is described as showing Troupe Gramarye. However, Vera's testimony says the stamp was from her favorite magicians, which aligns with the evidence. Wait, but in the story, when Apollo presents the Magic Show Ticket (Evidence 1), which is for Valant Gramarye's show, he connects it to the stamp. The contradiction might be elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking back at the trial transcript: The stamp (Evidence 28) was sent in a red envelope from the client. However, the testimony from Vera says that the stamp was a picture of her favorite magicians, which she kept. But the stamp was part of the poisoned envelope that killed Drew Misham. The contradiction could be that the stamp was from the client, but Vera kept it because it was her favorite magicians. However, the fact that the stamp was part of the poisoned evidence might contradict her statement about keeping it. Wait, no. The stamp was on the envelope, which was poisoned, but Vera kept the stamp. The contradiction might be that the stamp was part of the evidence, but Vera's testimony about keeping it because it was her favorite magicians would mean the client knew her preferences, implying a connection. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps during the cross-examination, Vera testifies that the stamp was her favorite magicians (Troupe Gramarye), but the evidence (Commemorative Stamp) shows Troupe Gramarye, which was sent by the client. The contradiction might be between her testimony and another evidence. Alternatively, maybe during Phoenix's trial, the forged diary (Evidence 16: Notebook Page) was presented, and later in Apollo's trial, Klavier connects it to Vera's forgery. The diary (Evidence 16) was a forged page that was used against Phoenix, and Vera's testimony about creating a diary page as her first job. So the testimony from Vera about creating a diary page (in the current trial) would contradict the evidence from the past trial (Notebook Page), but that's across different cases.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the testimonies provided here (Testimony 0-5 from Gumshoe), the contradiction could be between the Stage Pistol (Evidence 20) and one of the testimonies. For example, Testimony 3 says the bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, but if the pistol could only hold one bullet, and there were two shots (clown and victim), that's a contradiction. But in the story, Phoenix points out that the Stage Pistol can only fire one bullet. So if the testimony says the bullet came from the pistol, but the pistol was fired once (clown) and another time (victim), that's impossible. But according to the evidence, the Stage Pistol can only hold one round. Therefore, Testimony 3 (The bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene) would be contradicted by the fact that the pistol could only have fired once, implying that both the clown and victim couldn't have been shot by the same pistol. But the testimony says the bullet in the victim was from the pistol. So if the pistol was used to shoot both, but it can only hold one bullet, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the evidence Stage Pistol (20) contradicts Testimony 3 (bullet fired from the pistol), because the pistol could only fire once, but two shots were fired (clown and victim). Therefore, the correct pair is evidence 20 (Stage Pistol) and testimony 3 (The bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, no doubt about it), because the pistol could only fire once, but there are two bullet holes (clown and victim), which contradicts the testimony that the same pistol fired the bullet that killed the victim, implying it couldn't have been used for both."

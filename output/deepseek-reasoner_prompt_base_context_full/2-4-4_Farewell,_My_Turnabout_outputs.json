    "prompt": "You are provided with a list of characters, evidences and testimonies.\nStory:\n... I was wearing gloves at the time? Judge: Gloves...? But why would you be wearing gloves at the time? Andrews: It was the night of the award ceremony. So of course I dressed up for the occasion. Yes, now I remember... I'm almost sure I was wearing a pair of thin gloves. Judge: Hmm... I see... Well, Mr. Wright. It seems the witness was wearing gloves at the scene of the crime. Nothing strange about that. Phoenix: Hmm, I guess so... And I guess that makes sense. Edgeworth: Hmph. You're the epitome of a half-baked idea. Andrews: A brain is to be used, not to look pretty for med students carving cadavers. Phoenix: (Looks like I need to bake my thoughts just a little longer...) Edgeworth: Now, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony. Leads back to cross-examination That's strange... Phoenix: You were wearing gloves...? Isn't that a little strange? Andrews: Why is that strange!? Do you have something that would prove I was not wearing gloves at the time...? Present Wine Glass Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have your proof right here. This wine glass.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I think it's time for you to go home now, Wright... Before you hurt yourself, that is. Phoenix: (Hurt myself...!?) Judge: It's alright, Mr. Wright. You don't have to push yourself so hard. Phoenix: (I guess I was trying a little too hard there...) Edgeworth: Now, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Andrews: As for why I opened the case... Even I don't know. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was that because you were \"shocked and dazed\" at discovering the victim's body? Andrews: Yes... That's probably it. Phoenix: ... Andrews: ... Phoenix: (I'm not going to get anywhere if I continue pressing her like this... The only way to make her talk is with evidence... I guess I should give it a try...) Present Guitar Case Phoenix: Phoenix: There is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case. Andrews: Why would you say that!? Phoenix: It's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim! Andrews: Ah! Judge: What is it, Ms. Andrews? Andrews: ... You shouldn't assume that I must have left prints just because I touched the case. Phoenix: What do you mean? Andrews: What if I were to tell you that I was wearing gloves at the time? Judge: Gloves...? But why would you be wearing gloves at the time? Andrews: It was the night of the award ceremony. So of course I dressed up for the occasion. Yes, now I remember... I'm almost sure I was wearing a pair of thin gloves. Judge: Hmm... I see... Well, Mr. Wright. It seems the witness was wearing gloves at the scene of the crime. Nothing strange about that.

Isn't that a little strange? Andrews: Why is that strange!? Do you have something that would prove I was not wearing gloves at the time...?

Before you hurt yourself, that is. Phoenix: (Hurt myself...!?) Judge: It's alright, Mr. Wright. You don't have to push yourself so hard. Phoenix: (I guess I was trying a little too hard there...) Edgeworth: Now, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Mia: Come on, Phoenix. We can't afford to let up on her now. Phoenix: I wasn't planning on letting up, but... Mia: She's at her weakest now, so this is our chance! Phoenix: (Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...) Mia: I'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found. Phoenix: I have your proof right here. This wine glass. Andrews: The wine glass? Phoenix: You left your fingerprints very clearly on this wine glass. Andrews: Ah... Phoenix: Even if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!? Andrews: Ugn! Judge: Order! Order! Order!! Mia: Looks like you hit the nail on the head this time. Phoenix: ...? What do you mean? Mia: I believe that guitar case plays a very important role here. Phoenix: But it's just an empty case... Mia: I wonder if it really was empty though... Phoenix: B-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio! Mia: Phoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar. Phoenix: (You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...) Judge: Hmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided... Phoenix: Phoenix: No, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder! Phoenix: Uh... Judge: Can you do that, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Um, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case... Judge: The bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!? Phoenix: I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove! Edgeworth: Deflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!? Present The Nickel Samurai or Lotta's Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Th-This is... This is a photograph...!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: And why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one? Judge: Why, Mr. Wright, why? Phoenix: Well... I just thought it might have been possible...? Edgeworth: I have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be! Judge: Yes, and never bring it out again! Phoenix: (Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?) Edgeworth: Do you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder? Leads back to: \"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\" Judge: Th-This is... This is a photograph...! Phoenix: Yes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor. Judge: I-In this picture...? Phoenix: It doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume! Edgeworth: Wh-What!? Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself! Edgeworth: Wright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!? Phoenix: That insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews? Andrews: ...! Edgeworth: I-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!? Phoenix: Just outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct? Judge: You... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...? Mia: Nice job, Phoenix. Phoenix: Well, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later! Judge: Hmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: W-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!? Judge: Hmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...? It was stolen from Engarde. Phoenix: I think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde... Judge: S-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!? Phoenix: Maybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: And so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Maybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court! Phoenix: E-EXCUSE ME!? Edgeworth: Mr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!? Phoenix: ... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he? Judge: *sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\" It was a spare costume. Leads to: \"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\" Phoenix: Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one. Edgeworth: What...? Judge: Then... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!? Phoenix: Yes, that is what I am saying. Judge: And how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...? Edgeworth: It would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release) Judge: But... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act? Phoenix: ... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!? Phoenix: Huh!? N-No, I just... Judge: Mr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!? Mia: Phoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you! Phoenix: Alright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was... Present Press Conference Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"What is this...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!? Phoenix: I... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said! Mia: I told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"! Phoenix: *gulp* Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Ah, sorry... Mia: This one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it! Judge: Now then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time? Leads back to: \"Alright. This is what I think.\" Judge: What is this...? Phoenix: On the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference. Judge: A press conference...? Phoenix: Yes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference. Edgeworth: I heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright. Phoenix: But what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night. Andrews: ... Judge: But how can that be!? Phoenix: The way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself! Judge: Th-The victim? Phoenix: Yes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"! Judge: He was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!? Phoenix: That's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference. Edgeworth: The Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\". Phoenix: Which means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde! Judge: Yes, I guess that is what it would mean... Edgeworth: But, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"! Andrews: Hmph. Judge: M-Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: I can see why you are pros at what you do. Judge: Pardon me? Andrews: Yes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan. Judge: Ms. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this! Andrews: I was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me. Judge: You...!? Andrews: Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway. Judge: He was going to ruin him, huh...? Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed! Phoenix: What!? Judge: And do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: ... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is. Judge: Ah... I see. Edgeworth: ... Andrews: I... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all... Phoenix: P-Protect Mr. Engarde!? Judge: And yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior! Andrews: Yes, Your Honor. I understand. Witness Testimony -- Protecting Matt -- Andrews: From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer. Matt had to kill Juan no matter what. And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder. My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife... But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him... Judge: Hmm... This does account for everything... Andrews: Well... I am the logical type. Mia: We're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit. Judge: If the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!) Cross Examination -- Protecting Matt -- Andrews: From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Would you say that was your \"intuition\" speaking to you? Andrews: Don't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own. Phoenix: Urk... Andrews: If you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things. Phoenix: Three... things? Andrews: A motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear. Mia: You should have already known that, Phoenix... Phoenix: They didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember... Andrews: May I continue now? Andrews: Matt had to kill Juan no matter what. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference? Andrews: Yes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde. Judge: And you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews? Andrews: Yes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume. Phoenix: But... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference. Andrews: Oh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference? Phoenix: A-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony! Judge: Yes, I agree. Ms. Andrews, please correct your testimony, if you please. Andrews: \"Grasping at straws\" now, are we, Mr. Wright? Changes statement from \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" to \"I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\" Andrews: I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Has Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally? Andrews: ... Why do you ask? Phoenix: You were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out! Andrews: ... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern. In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill. Phoenix: (Why do I keep doing this to myself...?) Andrews: And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: B-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!? Andrews: I'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time. Judge: Hmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however. Phoenix: (The judge is glaring straight at Mia...) Mia: He's glaring at you, smart guy! Andrews: My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage! Andrews: Then... What about the button? Phoenix: The button...? Andrews: It's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume. Judge: You're talking about this button, correct? Andrews: That button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence. Phoenix: Urk. Judge: Looks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: A-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony! Andrews: I can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat. Mia: ... Phoenix: (... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...) Mia: With an icy stare, yes. Judge: Ms. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony. Changes statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\" Andrews: That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how do you know that? Andrews: When the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard. Phoenix: (Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?) Andrews: Don't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not! Phoenix: (Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?) Present Juan's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the victim's autopsy report.\" Andrews: But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time. Andrews: ! Edgeworth: Who's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it? Phoenix: This witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness. Andrews: ... Phoenix: As I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid. Mia: Really? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy. Phoenix: Wishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...) Mia: You should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk. Phoenix: Got it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!) Phoenix: This is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\". Andrews: S...Strangulation... Phoenix: The knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died. Judge: A-And what does that mean? Phoenix: Let's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when? Edgeworth: After the knife was stabbed into the victim... Phoenix: Exactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight! Andrews: Ah... Phoenix: That's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body! Judge: Order! Order! Wh-What is the meaning-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!? Phoenix: Let me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve? Edgeworth: What \"purpose\"...? Phoenix: We now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it? Edgeworth: ... Judge: Mr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!? To have a memento of the crime Phoenix: Maybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento... Edgeworth: Wright... I'll give this button to you as a memento. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: A reminder to never set foot in another court of law again for as long as you live! Judge: Yes... I think it would be for the best if you stayed away from the attorney's bench. Phoenix: W-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it! Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\" To pin the crime on Engarde Leads to: \"There is only one logical reason for doing something like that.\" To destroy evidence Phoenix: It was to destroy the evidence, of course! Edgeworth: ... Judge: ... Phoenix: Um... To destroy the evidence... Edgeworth: Yes, we heard you the first time! And which blasted piece of evidence was the person trying to destroy, Wright!? Phoenix: Umm... Judge: Mr. Wright! If you continue like this, I'm afraid you'll only destroy yourself! Phoenix: S-Sorry... Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\" Phoenix: There is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde! Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: There is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course! Judge: And... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!? Phoenix: (Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...) Mia: Phoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end! Phoenix: The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is... Present Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Adrian Andrews!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Wright. Which of these four doesn't belong here? Up, down, left, Wright. Phoenix: Um, \"Wright\"? Edgeworth: Thank you, I feel much better. I'm relieved to know you can at least pick that much out. I worry about you. You seem to fail every time you try to make logical sense! Mia: Or in other words, \"think before you speak\", Phoenix. Phoenix: (Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?) Judge: That's enough dawdling now, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Leads back to: \"The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\" Phoenix: Ms. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer! Andrews: Wh-What!? Judge: Order! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...? Phoenix: \"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews! Andrews: Wh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me! Phoenix: I can't, can I? Would you care to test me? Andrews: Then... Then what about this knife!? Phoenix: The knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you. Andrews: ...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!? Phoenix: This button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama! Andrews: Ughn... Phoenix: The only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews. Judge: I... I see... What about the empty guitar case...? Phoenix: That is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews! Andrews: N...No... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time! Judge: ...! Th-That's right! Phoenix: That's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body! Andrews: Aaaaaah! Phoenix: And to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him. Andrews: ...! Phoenix: Speaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not? Andrews: P-Please... Stop... Phoenix: Well, how about it, Ms. Andrews!? Andrews: Um... Phoenix: (I've got her this time!) Andrews: ... Judge: Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: ... I... I... I refuse... to testify. Phoenix: What was that...? Andrews: Th-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me! Judge: Well, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves. Phoenix: WHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...) von Karma: Adrian Andrews! Andrews: Y-Yes...? von Karma: Think hard about what we just discussed. Understood!? Andrews: A-Alright... ... Phoenix: (That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.) Mia: You did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done. Phoenix: Something I haven't done...? Edgeworth: Heh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence? Phoenix: ...! Judge: What is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: I'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: Everything you have proven is circumstantial. Phoenix: Circumstantial...? Edgeworth: Yes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida! Judge: M-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...? Andrews: I believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering. Judge: But Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...? Andrews: Maybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence. Phoenix: (NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...? Mia: Somehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation. Judge: I think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof. Phoenix: But! That's not true! Judge: In this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess. Phoenix: R-Recess...!? Judge: I request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial... Phoenix: (T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...) Phoenix: Phoenix: Please wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial! Edgeworth: What are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he? Phoenix: That... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya... Edgeworth: ...? Judge: But it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It is not impossible for this trial to continue. Andrews: ...! Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you... Edgeworth: It's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony! Judge: Y-Yes, that is very true, but... Edgeworth: Actually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews. Andrews: ... Edgeworth: When you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice. Andrews: Y-Yes... And...? Edgeworth: I can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice. Andrews: So my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already... Edgeworth: Before you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect. Andrews: Testify...!? Edgeworth: Your Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness. Judge: Hmm... Mia: I don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know... Judge: The court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please. Witness Testimony -- When I Found the Body -- Andrews: That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself. I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state. And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner. When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind. To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice. When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over. Judge: Hmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony? Andrews: ...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial. Mia: Phoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left... Phoenix: I know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?) Judge: Now then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- When I Found the Body -- Andrews: That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But... There wasn't anyone else in the room, right? Andrews: Of course not. Phoenix: Then... who did you pour it for? Andrews: Mr. Wright. There is a rhyme and reason for everything. Can you wait just a little longer for it to be revealed to you? Edgeworth: In other words, Wright, \"Be quiet and listen.\" Andrews: Precisely! I couldn't have said it better myself. Phoenix: Unnngh... Andrews: I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, it was a \"mess\"? Are you sure it wasn't messy because of your fight with Mr. Corrida...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I understand your frustrations at not being able to prove your theory. However... Before you go accusing people of crimes, go find yourself some evidence! Phoenix: (Grr...) Edgeworth: And then, what did you see next, witness? Andrews: And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Slumped over? Andrews: Yes, he was just sitting there with his head tilted forward, eyes closed. He really looked like he was sleeping. Phoenix: (...Is it just me or did that right there sound a little... odd?) Andrews: When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then what did cross your mind? Andrews: I thought maybe he had smashed everything up in anger because he lost the Grand Prix. And then felt tired after his rampage, so he decided to take a nap... Anyways, that's what I thought... Judge: I see. So you didn't think he was dead at all. Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\" Andrews: To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You thought he fainted...? Andrews: I thought he was asleep at first. But then, the room was in such a messy state... I thought maybe he had gotten into a fight with someone... Edgeworth: And that's when you went to pour the glass of juice? Andrews: Yes. He always has a hard time waking up. So Juan always has a glass of tomato juice to drink. Judge: Hmm... I see. And after that, what happened next? Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\" Andrews: When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how did you come to realize that he was, in fact, dead? Andrews: I shook him over and over, but I never got a response... So I set the glass down on the dresser and tried to take his pulse. I... I was shocked... and staggered backward... Edgeworth: And knocked the flower vase over. So that's what happened. Andrews: ...Yes. Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\" Mia: ... This is what it all comes down to. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: This is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case! Phoenix: (Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?) Phoenix: So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him? Andrews: No, not at all... Phoenix: Even though this is what you saw when you discovered the body? Andrews: ...Ah! Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: Isn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man! Andrews: Ah... Um... That's... Well, you see... Phoenix: I doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink! Judge: Y-Your point is...? Phoenix: Ms. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie! Andrews: Ungh! Phoenix: And your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer! Andrews: ... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: It looks like the defense has somehow brought the ugly truth to light. The defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde, is not guilty after all... Andrews: That... But that's impossible! You're wrong... Judge: M-Ms. Andrews! Try to have some composure! Andrews: It... It wasn't me... It wasn't me, I tell you! It was Matt! I swear it! He's the one who killed Juan! Phoenix: But you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you \"might\" end up incriminating yourself! Andrews: Th-That's because... Judge: Ms. Andrews, I will give you one last chance. What exactly are you hiding that may \"incriminate\" you? Andrews: ... I... I... I refuse... to testify. Judge: Then there is no need for this court to continue any further. Mr. Matt Engarde's innocence has been clearly demonstrated. Phoenix: (Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?) Mia: What's wrong, Phoenix? Phoenix: Usually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't. Judge: Now then, I would like to hand down my verdict for Mr. Matt Engarde. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor. The prosecution feels that it would be premature to pass down a verdict at this time. Judge: Wh-What...? Edgeworth: The reason is quite simple. This witness has yet to speak the absolute, real truth. Judge: The \"absolute, real truth\"...? What are you...? Edgeworth: Witness... Don't you understand yet? Andrews: ...Huh? Edgeworth: I don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you \"protect\" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the guilty party! Andrews: ...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you! Edgeworth: What...? Andrews: I... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty... Phoenix: (Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?) Andrews: I... I can't speak about it... I'm too scared... Mia: It's Franziska von Karma... Phoenix: Huh...? Mia: Don't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself. Phoenix: Th...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is... Mia: Yesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by Ms. von Karma. \"Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted.\" Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them... Phoenix: (Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!) Andrews: It wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...! Judge: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Judge: The court can't continue on like this, therefore I'd like to hear what you intend to do. Phoenix: (What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?) Edgeworth: Wright! I suggest you think very carefully about this! Think about what this witness did, and what she did NOT do! And think about who is the real mastermind behind this crime! Phoenix: (Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?) Edgeworth: Come now! What will you do!? What kind of man are you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Request \"not guilty\" verdict Phoenix: (No matter what she says... Ms. Andrews is the only person it could be! Not to mention... I don't have a choice. I have to win a complete acquittal today!) Y-Your Honor! The defense believes there is enough evidence to substantiate our claim! Therefore, we motion that this court passes a verdict of \"not guilty\" as soon as possible! Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, Wright! What have you learned in this past year!? Leads to: \"That's enough!\" Force Andrews to testify Phoenix: (I have to win a complete acquittal today... There's no way around that! But... I can't bring myself to do it like this! Not when she's making a face like that...) Ms. Andrews! I would like to know what you are really hiding! Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Are you sure you know what you're doing!? Phoenix: Sure, Mr. Engarde would get an acquittal, but in his place, you would be found guilty! Is this... Is this how you really want this trial to end!? Andrews: B-Be quiet... How dare you!? You... You're trying to trick me! Leads to: \"That's enough!\" Judge: That's enough! I commend you for trying, Mr. Edgeworth. However, it's clear that the defense's theory is the truth. Andrews: ...Y...You're wrong... Edgeworth: ... What a shame... (Changed from [Such a shame...] in the original release) Andrews: ...! Edgeworth: I had hoped things wouldn't come to this, however... Judge: Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Ms. Andrews. Since you absolutely refuse to testify... It falls on my shoulders to disclose this to the court. Andrews: ...S...Stop... Judge: M-Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: This witness... How should I put this... She has an illness. Andrews: What!? Edgeworth: And because of this illness, she has tried to commit suicide in the past. Andrews: S-Stop... Please stop...! Edgeworth: No matter how much you want to hide it, it's no use. I have the evidence right here. Andrews: Ah! Th-That's...! Phoenix: (That's the second part of the suicide report -- the attempted suicide report!) Edgeworth: What will you do now, witness? You know what I am about to do, don't you? I will now reveal to the court, the true nature of the pitiful woman known as Adrian Andrews! Phoenix: (The secret of her dependent nature... (Changed from [The secret of her co-dependant [sic] nature...] in the original release) Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...) Andrews: Please! Please STOP!! I beg you!! If people find out... If people find out... I... I'll... Edgeworth: If you're going to say you would \"choose death\", that is of no concern to me. Andrews: ...! Phoenix: (Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?) Edgeworth: However, before you die... I will pull the truth from your still-breathing lips! (Changed from [I will pull the truth from your breathing lips!] in the original release) ... No matter what I have to do. Andrews: ... Edgeworth: So, will you tell the court yourself, or shall I!? Either is fine with me. Andrews: ... ... ...I... I'll talk. But please... Help me... N-Nothing matters anymore... Witness Testimony -- My \"Crime\" -- Andrews: When I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest. When I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan. Once I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room. And then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button. Just when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience. And that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume. Judge: S-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!? Andrews: Isn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man! Judge: Wh... What do you mean by all of this...? Edgeworth: It might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth. Andrews: The real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time! Phoenix: (\"Last time\"...?) Edgeworth: So, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her \"crime\"! Phoenix: (Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?) Judge: Mr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination. Cross Examination -- My \"Crime\" -- Andrews: When I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But you could tell from the state the room was in, that there must have been a fight! Are you telling the truth when you say that you did not know he was dead? Andrews: He... had a scarf tied around his neck... But that scarf is a part of the Jammin' Ninja's costume... So... So I didn't think anything about it was strange... His head was also... tilted down a bit, so I couldn't see his face that well... That's why I thought I'd wake him up... and went to pour the juice... Andrews: When I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What is this \"plan\" you had? Andrews: ... I knew right away the murderer was Matt. I knew because Juan... He was going to expose Matt's weakest weakpoint to the world. So Matt did this to stop Juan, and silence him for good. That's when I thought, \"I should forge some evidence and pin this crime on Matt.\" Edgeworth: So the forged pieces of evidence were the knife and the button... Andrews: The first thing that came to mind was to plant the knife. Andrews: Once I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That was so you could get the knife, correct? Andrews: The knife Matt used at dinner had his fingerprints all over it. I thought if I used that, then the police would certainly turn their eyes towards him. Matt was napping with his costume on at the time. I slipped in, took the knife, and returned to the scene of the crime. Andrews: And then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were the one to stab the victim with that knife. Andrews: It gives me goosebumps to think about it now... What a horrible thing I did... But... At the time, I couldn't control my own body. It moved on its own. Then, when I stabbed Juan's dead body... I suddenly realized something. If I used the button somehow, I could make Matt look even more suspect. Edgeworth: So you thought to rip one of the buttons off and then plant it in Mr. Engarde's hakama. Andrews: Yes... That's what I had planned to do. ...But things never go that smoothly, do they? Andrews: Just when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: An \"inconvenience\"...? Andrews: There was a woman with a camera at the ready, loitering in the hallway. Phoenix: (I'm willing to bet my spikes it was Lotta...) Andrews: There was also a woman with a ray gun at the ready pacing back and forth... Phoenix: (That's Ms. Oldbag for you...) Andrews: I had already been caught and made into a big scoop for a certain weekly tabloid once, so I couldn't very well go out looking like myself and get caught again. Andrews: And that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were the one who prepared that costume, weren't you? Andrews: Yes. I took it from Global Studios... I also put it into Juan's guitar case the day before the award ceremony. Edgeworth: You did this in preparation for the press conference, correct? Andrews: Yes, Juan wanted to wear that costume and hold a press conference in it. He was going to disclose Matt's big secret there. Judge: And what is this \"secret\"...? Andrews: ... ...That, I don't know. Anyway, I thought that if I were to leave Juan's room in the Nickel Samurai costume... then people would think that Matt was the \"real\" murderer. I was very careful not to leave any fingerprints when I opened the guitar case. I absolutely did not want anyone to know about the costume. Phoenix: (I don't want to concede, but this testimony... it rings of the truth...) Mia: I'm sorry, Phoenix... Phoenix: N-No, please, don't apologize to me. We were both taken by surprise. Mia: Still, I'm sorry... After pressing all statements: Judge: I think we've heard enough! So, after that, you went back to Mr. Engarde's room and planted the button? Andrews: ...Into Matt's hakama? Yes. After that, I folded up the costume I was wearing and put it into a bag. Then I snuck it out of the hotel and got rid of it. Judge: M-My word... What does all this mean...? Andrews: ...Mr. Edgeworth, is it? Edgeworth: ... Andrews: The real criminal... is Matt Engarde!! Yesterday... That woman prosecutor sat me down for a talk... Phoenix: (Franziska, huh...) Andrews: She said that I should, under no circumstances, confess to what I had done. That if I just kept quiet, then Matt would be found guilty for sure... I... I had no choice but to believe in her words... Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: ... ............... Judge: What this witness has done is clearly unlawful. However... As long as her testimony stands, we can be certain she is not the real killer! Phoenix: W-Wait, Your Honor! The defense still... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wright. Phoenix: ! Edgeworth: It's pointless. At this point in time, it is not possible to indict Ms. Andrews on anything. Judge: Yes, exactly. There isn't a single piece of evidence that points to her as the murderer. The cross-examination of this witness is over. And so is today's trial. You couldn't establish that the witness was the culprit. Please let it go, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: B-But! Judge: Mr. Edgeworth, please place Ms. Andrews under arrest for further questioning. Edgeworth: Understood, Your Honor. The prosecution will arrange for her detention immediately. Judge: That's all. Court is adjourned for today! Phoenix: (Today's... Today's trial... It's over...! And I didn't win an acquittal!) Edgeworth: Witness... Would you mind if I asked you something? Phoenix: ...! (Edgeworth...?) Andrews: What is it...? Edgeworth: Before you leave court today, I wondered if I might look at one thing. The card in your hand. It's had my interest for quite some time now. What exactly is it...? Andrews: Oh, this...? Mr. Wright also asked about this. Although I didn't remember at the time you asked me about it, Mr. Wright, I remembered just now. I found this in the room on that day. Phoenix: \"The room\"...? Edgeworth: \"That day\"...? Andrews: Yes. I found this card when I discovered Juan's body. It was lying there right next to him... Phoenix: You found that card... next to the victim's body? Andrews: I suppose I must have unconsciously slipped it into my pocket... ...But it's not as if this card has any relevance to Juan's murder, right? Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess not. But it's still a strange card, if you ask me... But as far as a clue to this case...? I don't see why...) ???: Edgeworth: Witness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry! Phoenix: E-Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Do you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time! Andrews: I... I didn't mean to... Mia: Wh-What is this all about...? Phoenix: (I've never seen Edgeworth so emotional before... (Changed from [I've never seen such an emotional Edgeworth in my entire life...] in the original release) That card... What in the world is it? And what does it mean...!?) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!

Pearl: I... I can't take it... anymore... ...Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... Phoenix: L-Look! It'll be alright! Everything may still work out. Pearl: Hm...? Phoenix: The condition was that we had to get a \"not guilty\" verdict. And so far, the kidnapper has kept his word and hasn't hurt Maya. And he won't because Mr. Engarde hasn't been given a \"guilty\" sentence yet! Pearl: Unngg... Nnmff... *sniffle, sniffle* Phoenix: Cheer up! We don't have time to stand around crying! We have to get going! Pearl: ... Y-You're right... Mystic Maya is in much more pain than I am! Phoenix: Yes, that's right. So... ???: Hey! You guys! Glad I caught you, pal! Pearl: M-Mr. Scruffy Detective... Phoenix: (...Oh boy. Looks like Detective Gumshoe... has been dubbed \"Mr. Scruffy Detective\" in Pearls's book now...) Gumshoe: It's just plain ol' \"Mr. Dick Gumshoe\" now, and I came to talk to you, pal! Phoenix: (But we're kind of busy right now...) Examine Charley the plant Gumshoe: Hey, it's wilting a little! Pearl: I'll... I'll give it some delicious water, pal! Phoenix: Ah, it's OK... I already did that... Gumshoe: ...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...? Phoenix: (Did he just call the watering can, \"Mr.\"?) Poster Pearl: This is the... uh... Nickel Samurai, right? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, that's right. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!? Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. Pearl: Oh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either... Gumshoe: B-But I can read AND I'm tall, pal! Phoenix: P-Please stop competing with an 8 year old... It's disturbing... Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night! Gumshoe: B-But I can get it even more cleaner, pal! Pearl: Aaah! That's... That's for the toilet!! Phoenix: (What a mess. Literally...) Talk The future Phoenix: So, what are you going to do from now on? Gumshoe: Whadaya mean, pal? Phoenix: Well, you've been fired, right? So, do you have a new job lined up yet? Gumshoe: Oh, that! A-Ah... What am I supposed to do now, pal!? I... I don't have anything coming in at all until my next payday! Phoenix: Wh-What are you talking about!? You don't have another payday! Gumshoe: ... I guess that means I'm just gonna half [sic] to work here at your place, pal! Phoenix: S-SAY WHAT!? Gumshoe: You'll be searching for things that will prove Mr. Engarde's innocence all day, right? Phoenix: W-Well... yeah... Gumshoe: So yeah! I'm going to help you, pal! I've got lots of experience in investigating, and watching over people's places! And I'm great at making really simple meals, pal! I'll take care of it all! Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's let Mr. Scruffy Detective take care of things! Phoenix: A-Ah... OK... By the way, what's your best dish? Gumshoe: Instant noodles, pal. Phoenix: (Why am I surrounded by people who only eat cheap, unhealthy foods...?) Edgeworth Gumshoe: ...That was the first time I've ever seen Mr. Edgeworth act like that... Never thought he'd say something like, he didn't care if Ms. Andrews killed herself... Pearl: H-He said that!? That's horrible... Gumshoe: But because of him doing that, we got the truth finally. Phoenix: ...The truth... (Ms. Andrews' last testimony; I wonder if that was the truth...?) I'll give you that there was nothing strange in her testimony itself. But... I still think there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole thing. Gumshoe: You mean about \"that\" thing, pal? Phoenix: Why would she want to -- no, I mean, almost \"need\" to frame Mr. Engarde... I couldn't figure that out from anything she said all day! Gumshoe: ... Then... Then you're saying that testimony... was a lie...? Phoenix: Not a lie, per se... It just feels like there's more here than meets the eye. Or that's what Edgeworth would like us to believe... Pearl: Th-That's such a dirty trick! Even that woman prosecutor was better than that! Phoenix: (Franziska von Karma...) Speaking of Ms. von Karma, do you have any more information on her condition? Wasn't she shot this morning!? Franziska (appears after \"Edgeworth\") Gumshoe: Ms. von Karma was shot today on the way to the trial by a pistol, pal. Phoenix: B-But she's going to be fine, right? I mean, Edgeworth said she was in \"stable condition\", but... Gumshoe: Well, she was shot in the shoulder, so she's OK and still hanging in there. They should be done taking the bullet out, so she's probably resting at the hospital. Phoenix: Which one...? Gumshoe: What? Are you going to visit her, pal? Phoenix: N-No... Well, I was kind of thinking about it... Gumshoe: Hey! You've actually got a heart, don't you!? She looked like she was being tortured to death not being able to go to the trial today, so maybe it'd be good for her if you went and let her whip you for a bit, pal! Pearl: Let's go let her whip us, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Now I'm DEFINITELY not going. Gumshoe: Um... let's see... The name of the hospital... Oh yeah! The \"Hotti Clinic\"! Phoenix: (That name sends a chill down my spine... Well, I guess it can't hurt to stop by and say hi...) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Look, it's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Oh! It's a little tarnished, don't you think, pal? Don't worry! I'll make it all sparkly shiny again! Phoenix: (I... I'm really touched...) Radio Transceiver Gumshoe: Have you heard anything from the kidnapper...? Phoenix: ...No... not yet. Gumshoe: I'm sure once he hears what happened at the trial today, he'll call, pal. But remember! You can't provoke him when you get to talk to him! Jammin' Ninja's Button Gumshoe: When I saw that button, I thought to myself, \"This is gonna prove Mr. Engarde's guilty!\"... But it looks like there was a lot more to it than I thought, huh pal? Phoenix: You're a pro. You should know better than to say something like that. Gumshoe: W-Well, I'm not a cop anymore. Just a regular helper around the office now, so... Phoenix: (I wonder if he misses working down at the precinct...?) Knife Gumshoe: Who would've thought that this knife Mr. Engarde used to eat his dinner steak with... Phoenix: Go on... Gumshoe: ...That it would be stabbed into the victim's body by Ms. Andrews, of all people. I guess she just hated the victim that much, huh pal? Phoenix: The question isn't why she hated the victim to that extend, but rather why she tried to pin the murder on Mr. Engarde. Pearl: I wonder if she really hates Mr. Engarde? Lotta's Photo Gumshoe: So this \"Nickel Samurai\" was really Ms. Andrews, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. This is either when she went to Mr. Engarde's room to get the knife... ...or when she was done with the foul deed. But I guess we'll never know. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: It'll be OK! You'll see her again, little missy! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Gumshoe: It's really important that you don't give up! Pearl: O-OK! Phoenix: (I guess a big voice really does give you a sense of presence...) Pearl: I... I won't give up. Ever! Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Cheer up! You can't give in, missy! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Gumshoe: Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol... ... I... I don't have my pistol or my police badge anymore... Pearl: Cheer up! You can't give in! Gumshoe: Y-Yeah! Phoenix: (What are those two doing...?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: People are jealous of my roguishly cool \"detective look\", pal. It's because of this look that I passed the detective's test, you know. Phoenix: Oh. Gumshoe: But you know, people can't coast through life on their looks alone, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, you can't count on your looks alone. Pearl: Wow... I learned something new today... Franziska von Karma profile Phoenix: Is she alright...? After being shot, I mean... Gumshoe: Her wound isn't that bad... Well, the gunshot wound anyway... But the wound to her pride, now that's a different story, pal. Phoenix: The wound to her pride? Gumshoe: Well, until now, she's always upheld the \"Von Karma Creed\", but since she came here, well, you've given her pride quite a beating, pal. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: I mean, she may act all grown-up, but she's really still just an 18 year old. ...Quite frankly, I worry about her, pal. Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: That's the first time I've seen that side of Mr. Edgeworth, pal. Forcing people to say what he wants them to during testimony... I want to know what in the world happened to him all this time he's been gone... Matt Engarde profile Gumshoe: I can't believe it. Maya getting kidnapped all because of this guy... I mean, what kind of person is the real murderer anyway!? Pearl: Maybe they're a big fan of Mr. Engarde? Phoenix: (But the kidnapper's voice... He sounded like an old man to me...) Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: My impression of her has totally changed, pal. Phoenix: Um... So, where is she right now...? Gumshoe: I'm sure she's being questioned down at the precinct. At the very least about messing with the body, and obstructing the investigation. And she'll probably be staying over at the detention center... Phoenix: (The detention center, huh...) Celeste Inpax profile Gumshoe: She was Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor. Phoenix: (Because of the suicide of the mentor she depended on, Adrian Andrews tried to follow her in an attempted suicide... Now the question is, who is Ms. Andrews relying on now...?) Anything else Phoenix: Could you please take a look at this...? Gumshoe: Um... I can't think of anything to say about this, pal. ... Wh-Why don't I make us some instant noodles, instead? Phoenix: Th-That's OK... Really. March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (From what the guard told me... It sounds like along with Mr. Engarde, Ms. Andrews is also being detained here.) Pearl: Then we should talk with them since we're here... Phoenix: Yeah, but both of them are still in questioning. Pearl: Hmm... And we don't have time to waste. Phoenix: (Yeah, visiting hours are almost over...) Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitor's the visitor's room. Catching a few z's while he's standing; now that's a good way to spend free time. March 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby Pearl: Alright now, Mr. Nick! Let's go look for clues! We have to, for Mystic Maya's sake... ???: You shall not pass! Phoenix: *gasp* Ms. Oldbag! Oldbag: Don't devalue my name and turn it into a gasp, you spiky-headed poof! Because of you, I've been made to look like the bad guy again! Although, I did get a piece of gum from Edgey-boy, just as he promised... But what I really wanted was something much more valuable! I wanted Edgey-poo's heart! I want it all for me! It's all your fault! You've awakened the wild beast inside of this Oldbag! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! (Changed from [Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!] in the original release) Pearl: Aah! Ms. Oldbag! Oldbag: Keep your hands off of me! This helmet is airtight! No air's [sic] gets in and no air gets out! Phoenix: Umm... Then why do you keep putting it on...?Umm... What does your helmet have to do with anything? Oldbag: Hmph! Don't tal release ({{{2}}})hink you can get me to move with silly questions! You're going to have to defeat me if you want to get by! Phoenix: (I'm not hearing this...) Examine Anywhere Oldbag: Hey! I said no restless loitering and no touching! You're interfering with my watch, and that's a no-no! Phoenix: (Argh. Looks like in order to search around here... I have to first get this kooky \"alien\" to go away...) Talk Any options Phoenix: Um... Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Oldbag: Hah! You're a million light-years too early to be asking ME questions, whippersnapper! Phoenix: (Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky \"alien\"...) Present Anything Phoenix: Umm... Could you please take a look at this...? Oldbag: Hmph! Sorry, sonny. I can't see it very well through this helmet! Phoenix: (Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky \"alien\"...) Oldbag: I see that look in your eyes! You stop thinking I'm an alien from outer space this instant! March 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Pearl: Wow. Everybody looks really busy with something or another... Phoenix: Hmm... They're probably strengthening the evidence for tomorrow's trial. Detective: Hey! Hurry up with that, will ya!? Pass that victim's list around! ...Now you're speaking nonsense! There's more than 100 people on there! Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick...? Is Mr. Engarde a really bad, terrible criminal...? Phoenix: ... Actually, Pearls, never mind. It sounds like they're working on a different case... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"...Very well. Now why do you want to work for our company?\" \"Well, that would have to be because I feel I would like to help this company grow.\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for corporate interviews. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Prosecutor von Karma was shot in front of the courthouse!? Wh-Who did it!? Who shot her!? Phoenix: (I have a sneaking suspicion that even Gumshoe could do this guy's job...) After clearing \"Franziska\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices: March 22Hotti ClinicReception Phoenix: (...Never thought I'd ever come back to this place...) ???: Hmm, yes... Are you here to visit a patient? Hmm... Phoenix: Ah, hi... ...Wait a second! You're...! ???: Hmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. Phoenix: Why are you still here!? Hotti: Hmm, yes... What is it? Hmm... Can I help you? You can tell me... Hmm, yes... ???: Director Hotti! Phoenix: E-Edgeworth... Hotti: Hmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. ...Oh, you're the man from this morning. Hmm, yes... What is it?... Uh huh... Edgeworth: Director. Franziska... How is Franziska von Karma? Hotti: Hmm... You don't need to worry. Hmm, yes... She's in good hands... Because, you see... I'm personally taking good care of her... Hmm, yes... Hee hee. Hmm, yes... and that thing... that surgery... It went well. Edgeworth: ...You have my gratitude. Phoenix: (It looks like Edgeworth doesn't know about this \"Director\" and his secret...) Hotti: She looked so pitiful -- absolutely terrified. Hmm, yes... But I understand, hmm... Hmm, yes... Her opponent was a gun, after all. Uh huh. And when I snuck up on her real secret-like, she would scream really loud. Hmm, yes. Edgeworth: I see. Hotti: Ah, but she's really cute too. When I'd do that, she'd whip me with her whip, uh huh... Boy did I cry like a baby. Hmm, yes... But I think I could get used to it. Hmm... Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! von Karma: Go back to your room. Hotti: You're so mean, uh huh... So mean... my frisky Friska. But that's good too-- Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! OK, OK... I... Hmm, yes... It's time for my IV drops. Hmm, yes... von Karma: ... And what are those tulips doing in your hand, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Argh! I knew I shouldn't have come here!) Examine Waiting room on left Phoenix: This must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients. Hotti: Hmm, yes... well, visiting hours are over. That's why... Hmm... It's time for nightly consultations to begin... Mine, that is... Heh heh heh. Phoenix: (...Isn't there anyone keeping an eye on this guy...?) Door at the back Phoenix: (I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?) Hotti: Oh, that's the X-ray room. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: H-H-How did you know what I was thinking!? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, it's... Because that's the X-ray room... Uh huh, yes... Phoenix: (There is something very peculiar about this guy... Because I know it's not me...) Limping patient Phoenix: This patient is undergoing rehabilitation. Hotti: Wasn't that patient standing in the same spot the last time you came to visit? Doesn't look like they've moved any closer to the reception desk, huh? Is this clinic really doing anything!? Is that patient really getting better!? Hmm... Phoenix: Hey! Don't just cut into my monologue like that! I'm explaining things here! Hotti: Ah, sorry. Hmm, yes... Most sorry... Yes... Uh, huh... Reception area Phoenix: This is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's \"Word to the Wise\": \"Put your best foot forward.\" Putting this up at a general clinic like this is doesn't really mean much, does it...? Talk The shooting von Karma: I was shot in front of the courthouse, in my right shoulder. Hmph... It's no big deal. This sort of thing happens all the time. I even had full intentions of running the trial this morning. Pearl: But! But that would've been too much for you! (Changed from [But! But that would've been too much!] in the original release) Phoenix: (There's no need to act tough in front of us, you know...) (Changed from [Yeah! You looked like you were deathly scared until only a few minutes ago...] in the original release) von Karma: Regardless, I was dragged here by THAT man over there. (Changed from [But I was dragged here by THAT prosecutor.] in the original release) He was so unyielding, one has to wonder if he was simply interested in stealing my case. (Changed from [He even went so far as to grab me by the wrist the whole way here.] in the original release) Edgeworth: It was the only logical course of action given the bullet was still lodged in your shoulder. But by taking over the case... (Changed from [But with me doing so...] in the original release) I found myself having to clean up after you and that irresponsible deal you made. von Karma: ...! Phoenix: (I think I know what \"deal\" he's referring to...) The deal Phoenix: Ms. von Karma. You made a deal with Ms. Andrews yesterday, didn't you? von Karma: I don't know what you mean. Phoenix: In order to make sure you got your guilty verdict on Mr. Engarde, you told Ms. Andrews to not testify in court today. von Karma: Hmph, I don't know what you're talking about. Do you have proof that I made such a deal? Phoenix: Y-You're denying it!? von Karma: ... It looks like you were lucky, Mr. Phoenix Wright. If I had been in court today, this trial would already be over. Phoenix: All while hiding Ms. Andrews' own crime? von Karma: That isn't my problem. Whether she had tampered with evidence or not... I have only one objective. To find Engarde guilty of murder. The end justifies the means, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The end justifies the means. Present Anything Phoenix: Aah! von Karma: ... Phoenix: (I guess that's all I get...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Ms. von Karma. Adrian Andrews believed you when you said, \"If you don't tell the truth of what really happened, then Engarde will be found guilty.\" von Karma: And what does that have to do with me? Phoenix: Because of that, she is now in danger of being found guilty herself! All because she believed in your words until the very end... von Karma: ... That still has nothing to do with me. She's just a weak person, that's all. Phoenix: But you had to know she was... OWWW! von Karma: ... I think visiting hours here are about over. So, if you'll excuse me. Pearl: What's wrong? Why did she suddenly cut you off...? Phoenix: (Probably because she thinks I had the advantage in that argument... ...Edgeworth...) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: What happened today at the trial, Edgeworth? That was not like you at all... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: I mean, I know you knew about Ms. Andrews' condition. You could have made her testify as many times as you wanted, but to go that far...! Edgeworth: ...Ah, but she wouldn't testify about THAT until I said something. Listen, Wright. The courtroom is a garden of judgment. I am putting myself on the line when I stand in there. And that's why I made the witness do the same... It's only natural. Adrian's card Phoenix: By the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you. Edgeworth: Witness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry! Edgeworth: Do you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time! Phoenix: That card... What in the world is it? Edgeworth: ... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it. Phoenix: I-I understand. Edgeworth: Their task is to find the \"owner\" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that. Phoenix: (An assassin!?) Picture Card added to the Court Record. Adrian's card (subsequent times) Phoenix: By the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you. Edgeworth: Witness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry! Edgeworth: Do you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time! Phoenix: That card... What in the world is it? Edgeworth: ... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it. Phoenix: I-I understand. Edgeworth: Their task is to find the \"owner\" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that. Phoenix: (An assassin!?) Assassin (appears after \"Adrian's card\") Phoenix: So who is this \"Shelly de Killer\"? Edgeworth: \"De Killer\" is the name of a long standing line of assassins. Pearl: Long standing? Edgeworth: The name first appeared about 100 years ago, I hear. Shelly is the professional name of the third heir to the De Killer name. Phoenix: So because his professional name is \"Shelly\", he leaves cards with a shell on them...? Edgeworth: He has a habit of making sure to leave a card by the body of his victims. Pearl: Why would he do something like that...? Edgeworth: We think it is a part of his duty to his clients. Phoenix: His \"duty\"? Edgeworth: If he leaves a card, then his clients can be assured it was he who killed the victim. It also serves as insurance against any charges being pushed onto his clients. Phoenix: ...I see... Edgeworth: De Killer values the trust between his clients and himself above all else. It seems that this is one honorable assassin with a moral conscience. Phoenix: (I guess that even honorable assassins can exist...) So, you think this assassin... You think he's the one who did the killing in this case? Edgeworth: It would appear that way. The discovery of the card basically confirms it, wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: (Shelly de Killer, huh...) Maya's situation (appears after \"Assassin\") Leads to: \"I noticed something at the trial today.\" Present Anything Edgeworth: ...I've been put in charge of this case. So I can't give you any help with reagards to clues or evidence. Phoenix: You sure are hardnosed. Totally different from Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: ...And that is why he was fired. Phoenix: (He's got a point...) Edgeworth: I noticed something at the trial today. You were behaving in a very strange manner. ...Is something the matter? Phoenix: (I guess... I should just tell him.) Maya... She's been kidnapped. Edgeworth: K-Kidnapped? What does the kidnapper want!? Phoenix: An acquittal. Edgeworth: ... I see. I had no idea. ... I will prepare a rescue team as soon as possible, and resolve this by tomorrow. Pearl: R-Really!? Did you hear that, Mr. Nick!? M-Mr. Edgeworth is going to... Phoenix: Stop trying to console me, Edgeworth! I don't need your pity! Pearl: Mr. Nick? Phoenix: There's no way you can find her. We don't have even a single clue to go on. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: There's only one way to save her. I... I have to get an acquittal somehow! It's the only way! Edgeworth: ... Wright. Listen, you need to know something. Juan Corrida was killed by Shelly de Killer. And the client who ordered the job... is Matt Engarde... Your own client. Phoenix: Please, stop! ...I can't listen to you. I can't believe that. Edgeworth: ...I see. Well, if you want to continue your investigation, you will need this. Pearl: What is it? Edgeworth: The hotel right now is restricted to police personnel only, as we are looking for any clues that might lead us to Shelly de Killer. If you take this with you to the hotel, I'm sure they will let you enter. Letter of Introduction added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: ...In any case, I must attend to the preparations for Maya's rescue team. We'll meet again, if anything should happen. Now if you'll excuse me... Pearl: Mr. Nick? Do you... Do you think... Mr. Engarde hired an assassin...? Phoenix: No way! (I mean, he doesn't have a Psyche-Lock...) Pearl: Y-Yeah, I guess not... Phoenix: Maya... Please... All I ask is you make it home, safe and sound! Date:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Maya: Heh heh. I guess even kidnappers can be a little clumsy. Clumsy enough to drop a card like this for me. And even though he said he was an \"assassin\", I bet he's just making that up, like how Nick does with everything in court. Anyway, let's try out the card trick with this card I just found... ...*click*... Maya: Sounds like I got the door open... OK! Time to go take a look around! Examine Door Maya: I've unlocked the door with this card... I should probably go and take a look around... Date:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Maya: Wh-What is this place...? I've got a feeling I'm not in the hotel anymore... Are those videos over there? ...Well, I'll worry about that later. For now, I should be looking for clues. That way, I can show them to sis and maybe get out of here! Examine TV Maya: Wow, I've never seen a TV this big before. Now where's the power button... Hmm... ...*click*... Maya: ... Phooey. It's busted. I would so die a happy Samurai fan... if I ever got to see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this. ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about dying, all things considered... Satellite dish Maya: What is this thing? An antenna... I guess? And this is... a VCR? There sure are a lot of electronic gadgets here. But what is an antenna doing here...? Computer Maya: Oh, hey. It's a computer. I've never really used one before. ... Um... I have no idea where the power switch on this thing is... Drat. There goes my plan to use this somehow to get out of here. Table Maya: There's a framed picture sitting on this coffee table. It's a picture of a woman... She's kind of pretty. Hey, looks like something's written here... Let's see... I think it says, \"With love... Celeste\" I bet this could be a clue... Sofa Maya: ...That's weird. What's a figurine doing on a sofa in a place like this...? I think it's... a bear. Aww, how cute! But it's got a lot of cuts and slits on it... I wonder if it's some kind of puzzle or something... Video tapes Maya: It's so dark in here that I can barely see, but... these kinda feel like... video tapes... All of them... Just what kind of room is this...? Door Maya: Unngh... Locked. Of course. And it doesn't look like I can use the card to open this door. There's a little hole at the bottom of the door. If only I was a little skinnier. Then maybe I'd be able to crawl through there... After examining satellite dish, table, sofa, and door: ???: Oh, this simply will not do... I cannot have you wandering around at will. Maya: Eeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ???: ...It seems... that your Mr. Wright is truly concerned about you. Maya: He is...? ???: For now, I would suggest you remain cooperative. If you cannot, there are ways in which I can help you... Maya: Ways... You mean... ???: \"Dead men tell no tales\" is how the saying goes, correct? Maya: \"D-D-D-D-Dead\"!? ???: I'm almost certain I told you on our first meeting. I am... an assassin. Maya: N-No way... You're lying... I mean... An assassin...? ???: ...People are not always who they appear to be. Maya: Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick! March 22, 7:04 PMHotti ClinicReception Pearl: Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Hm? O-Oh yes, Pearls? (Got caught up in my thoughts about Maya's situation...) Pearl: Mr. Edgeworth has left, you know. Phoenix: (I guess for now, I have no choice but to believe in Mr. Engarde. But I think I should listen to his story one more time...) Alright! Let's get going, too. Pearl: OK! March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Jailer: I'm sorry, but visiting hours are over for today. Pearl: Aw... Phoenix: (Argh... I have too many questions I need to ask...) I-I'm sorry, but I'm Phoenix Wright, a lawyer for one of the... Jailer: You're Mr. Wright, you say? Oh, yeah, there's a message here for you. Phoenix: A message...? Jailer: It's from Matt Engarde. ...Ah, here you are. Pearl: What did he write!? Is it something really important...? Phoenix: I don't know. Well, let's see what it has to say... \"To Mr. Lawyer dude, I've got something really important to tell you.\" (Changed from ['To the lawyer dude. I've got something really important to tell you.'] in the original release) (Why do I feel uneasy all of a sudden...?) Engarde: ... ... Oh, Mr. Wright. So actually... I have a favor to ask of you. I have this cat named Shoe. I didn't put out a lot of food when I left the house, so he's probably pretty hungry. You think you could drop by my house and feed Shoe for me, dude? My house is just a little ways down from the hotel, alright? Phoenix: ... Pearl: Th-This is terrible! Let's hurry! We have to feed his cat! I'm sure poor Shoe's stomach is growling by now! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I guess... Matt's Note jammed into a pocket. Phoenix: (A client's request is a request... Guess I should go check up on his cat.) Hotel Lobby Present Letter of Introduction Leads to: \"Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...\" Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...) Um... Ms. Oldbag... If you would look at... Oldbag: What!? You want me to look at this worthless piece of... .................. ...Edgey-pooooo... Phoenix: (Ugh... Is that her perfume, Ph\u00e9romone d'Amour, I smell...? *shudder*) Oldbag: Let's see here... \"Would you please allow this unsophisticated young person to conduct his investigation? Yours truly, Miles Edgeworth\" Phoenix: \"Y-Yours truly\"!? Oldbag: Hmph, that man's good at flattery. Fine. But only because Edgey-poo said so, you understand!? Letter of Introduction given to Ms. Oldbag. Oldbag: I just thought of something I have to do. Remember, no messing around! You do anything bad and I won't let you off the hook! Pearl: It looks like she has strong feelings for Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: That may be, but you know nothing's going to come of it. Pearl: That's so mean, Mr. Nick! Feelings are meant to be told and shared! Phoenix: Owww... (Every time we talk about love, I always end up with a handprint on my face somehow.) Um, so anyway, let's continue our investigation. Pearl: OK! Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Phoenix: Ack! What!? What now!? Oldbag: One little thing, before I forget. You can't go into Engarde's room today. Pearl: Why? Oldbag: The police's main investigation team is going to be in there all day, you hear? Phoenix: (I wonder if they're the team in charge of investigating \"De Killer\"...?) Oldbag: So don't go in there! Set one foot in there and you'll face the wrath of Wendy Oldbag! Examine Stage Phoenix: It's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but... Pearl: But that press conference... Phoenix: It was really the victim, Juan Corrida, trying to disclose something about Mr. Engarde. Pearl: But they're both heroes... Why would they do something so un-heroic? Phoenix: They may look like heroes on the outside, but on the inside, they're only human. Pearl: ... After clearing \"Maya's situation\" Talk option in Hotti Clinic - Reception, then visiting Detention Center: March 22Engarde MansionLiving Room Phoenix: (Hmm, sure is dark...) Pearl: I'll go turn on a light! Phoenix: Wow... So this is what a star's house looks like. Must be nice to be rich. Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's find Shoe, the kitty-cat! Shoooooe! Shoe: Meow. Phoenix: So I guess this is Shoe. Pearl: Ah, what a lovely cat. ...Hello, Shoe. Shoe: Meow. Pearl: ...Tee hee. Phoenix: (The cat seems to like Pearls.) ???: Pardon me... Phoenix: ! ???: May I help you with something, Mister... Phoenix: Oh, uh, we're lawyers. Actually, I'm Mr. Engarde's lawyer. ???: The master's... Then, you must be Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes. ???: Ah, it's a pleasure to meet your wonderful self. Doe: I am the family butler, John Doe. Phoenix: Nice to meet you. Shoe: Meow. Examine Fireplace Pearl: Oh! There's a giant cooking hearth here. Phoenix: That's actually a fireplace. Pearl: How are they different, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... (You know, I've never actually seen a hearth before, come to think of it...) Pearl: You should come and visit Fey Manor, then. I'll show you one when you do. Motorcycle Pearl: A... A giant bicycle is flying through the air! Phoenix: ... That bicycle, Pearls, is one where you don't have to pedal, and it moves on its own. Pearl: Really!? Wow! Phoenix: But sorry to disappoint you, it can't fly. Pearl: ...Oh. That's too bad. Lounge set Phoenix: It's a very comfortable and spacious lounge set. I wonder if famous stars drop by and sit around and have a good time. ...In any case, I don't really belong here, do I? ... Argh. What is with me and feeling inferior today...? Pearl: ? Masks Pearl: Ah! There are masks here! Phoenix: Yeah. That one in the middle is the Steel Samurai. The ones next to that are the Pink Princess and the Evil Magistrate. They fought many battles against the backdrop of Neo Olde Tokyo. Pearl: Wow, you really know a lot about the Steel Samurai, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: ... (I don't know whether to laugh or cry that I know more about that show than a kid...) Doorway behind railing Phoenix: There's another door over there. Pearl: You shouldn't go wandering off over there, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: ...Yes, Pearls. (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her to stop playing around...) Door Pearl: There's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: I bet it's for Mr. Engarde's cat to use. Pearl: Oh, you mean Shoe. Phoenix: (The door... It's locked tight. Well, I guess that's to keep nosey people like me from entering it.) Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: You must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right? Doe: Honestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs. Phoenix: (Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...) John Doe Phoenix: Mr. Doe, how long have you served at this residence...? Doe: Well, sir, I would have to say... maybe about one year? Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of himself and his affairs. Phoenix: (You know, I would've thought Mr. Engarde the kind to have a maid over a butler...) ([maid] in quotation marks in the original release) Shoe Phoenix: That's a very cute cat you've got here. Doe: It is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat. Phoenix: (...Well then. I guess I don't need this piece of scrap paper anymore.) Matt's Note crumpled into a ball and thrown away. Shoe (subsequent times) Phoenix: That's a very cute cat you've got here. Doe: It is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat. Present Matt Engarde profile Phoenix: You must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right? Doe: Honestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs. Phoenix: (Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...) Any evidence Phoenix: I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look at this. Doe: I'm afraid I cannot offer up anything special about it. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of evidence for a trial. Phoenix: (Polite yet snotty with a touch of rude. He's the stereotypical butler alright.) Any other profiles Phoenix: Would you happen to know who this person is...? Doe: No, I would not. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master's acquaintances. Phoenix: (Then what in the world CAN I talk to you about!?) Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! Being angry is bad! After clearing all Talk options: Doe: ...Well, I'm afraid I must take my leave of you now. Phoenix: Oh, we should probably get going ourselves. Doe: Ah, so young and yet already so accomplished. A master of law... Phoenix: But there is also a lot to be proud of in being a butler, in charge of the house and all. Doe: Thank you for the compliment, sir. ...People are not always who they appear to be. ...Now if you'll excuse me. Shoe: Meow. March 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall Phoenix: Looks like we're the only ones here. Pearl: And yet... the hotel seems so busy somehow... Phoenix: (Probably because the police team is scouring for clues about \"De Killer\"...) Examine Front table Pearl: I want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again... Phoenix: Yeah, me too... Pearl: Whenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot. Phoenix: Well, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast! Pearl: OK! Let's work really hard, then! March 22Gatewater HotelHallway Lotta: Hey, City Boy! Phoenix: L-Lotta... You're still here... Lotta: Reckon course! An investigative photographer eats or starves on her ability to snap up the scoop, yeah!? And this hotel just has that \"aura of mystery\". Ya know, like something's always about to happen. Pearl: But... Do you have a camera? Lotta: Reckgiven! A photographer's gotta have cameras out the ear like corn to be a real pro, ya know!? So I'm hangin' around here... ... ... Speaking of cameras and feedin' the mouth, do ya have mine, ya bread-thief!? Phoenix: (Why can't you drop that \"thief\" thing already?) Examine Teddy bear Pearl: Aww, how lovely! The teddy bear looks happy to be surrounded by so many beautiful flowers. Phoenix: (Pearls really seems to like teddy bears a lot.) Phoenix: Ah... I wonder if... Lotta also... Lotta: I didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word! Phoenix: (Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?) Flowers on left Phoenix: Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Although, other than sunflowers and tulips, I have no idea what any of them are. Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick? What's this flower called? Phoenix: It's a sunflower... I think. Pearl: This flower over here is pretty too. Phoenix: That's a tulip, I guess. Pearl: ... Lotta: Callin' everythin' a sunflower or a tulip; don't reckon even little kids'll fall for that! Door on right Phoenix: There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". Pearl: The old lady told us about this, didn't she? That we can't go in this room tonight. Phoenix: (I wonder if an investigation briefing is going on right now inside... Without Detective Gumshoe...) Talk Night of the murder Phoenix: I want to ask you about the night of the murder. Lotta: What? Ya really gonna shell out the bucks for the info I got!? Phoenix: Lotta, you were loitering in this hallway the night of the murder, were you not? Lotta: Well, kinda... But... Phoenix: (Brace yourself, Phoenix. Here it comes...) (Changed from [Brace yourself, Wright. Here it comes...] in the original release) Lotta: I didn't exactly hang around here the entire time, ya know. Followed a few stars around... got a few autographs, shook a few hands, had a soda-pop with a few of 'em too. Phoenix: (Looks like she wasn't here the entire time that night...) Pearl: The security lady also wasn't in this hallway the whole time either. Phoenix: (I guess this means there's no one who can tell us who came and went that night...) Scandal Phoenix: So, about the note that was inside your camera case. Lotta: Oh, that ditty I wrote? Phoenix: Yeah... Can I believe what you've written? Lotta: Ya mean the stuff about Engarde shovin' his manager lady onto Corrida? Phoenix: Yeah... Lotta: Ah, well, I reckon ya best not be believin' that. Phoenix: What? Lotta: Look, I sorta wrote that on a whim, ya know? Writin' whatever came to mind. Pearl: \"Whatever came to mind\"...? Lotta: Yeah, when ya get down to it, it's just a lotta random bull dooders. Phoenix: ... Pearl: ... Lotta: Hey, what's with ya!? Why ya starin' at me like my grandpa used to!? Phoenix: Hmph. Lotta: Hey, and why do you look like you suddenly got older too!? Or am I just shrinkin' here!? Pearl: Umm... Camera Lotta: Ah! My baby! My $1,600 baby! What's with that red-coated prosecutor anyhow!? The guy told me it was \"evidence\" and refused to give it back to me! Phoenix: Well, that's kind of how it is... Lotta: Hey, hey. Yer that red-coat's friend, ain't ya? So put in a few good words for me and git me back my camera. Phoenix: Y-You want me to do what!? Lotta: Listen, nag the guy real good fer 'bout five hours and I guarantee he'll give it back. Phoenix: Why don't you do your own dirty work...? Present Anything Phoenix: Um, would you please take a look at this? Lotta: Nope. Sorry. No can do. Only thing I wanna see is a steamin' hand towel. Phoenix: Um, what? A steaming hand towel...? Lotta: Need one for my eyes. Today just ain't a good day for my eyes to be lookin' at stuff. Phoenix: (How convenient! Maybe I'll have to use that one next time you show me something!) After clearing all Talk options: Lotta: ... Well, I reckon it's time for me to get going. A tabloid photographer without a camera is just a \"tabloid\", huh. Phoenix: Umm... Yeah, I guess so. Lotta: Keep yerself together out there, ya hear!? I'm comin' to see ya in court tomorrow. Phoenix: O-OK, I'll see you then... Lotta: And you too there, little 'un. Keep up the good work, OK? Pearl: OK! Lotta: Don't be picky about yer food, now. Pearl: OK! Lotta: And make sure ya do all yer homework, ya hear? Pearl: OK! Lotta: And if you happen to find yerself a camera, make sure ya bring it right to me, ya-- Phoenix: Would you please just leave already!? Examine Door on left Phoenix: There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". (I wonder what EXACTLY happened in the room behind this door...? Even now, no one really has any idea...) March 22Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room ???: ... Ooongh... Oooonnngh... Ooongh... Oooonnngh... Pearl: M-M-Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Wh-What is that otherworldly, ghastly moaning...!? ???: ... Ooonnnn... Oooo... Nnnghff... Ghfff... Pearl: I... I hate evil ghosts... Waaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: I don't think it's a ghost... Maybe it's a demon!? ???: E-Excuse me!? Watch who you're calling a demon, brat! Pearl: Aaaah! Phoenix: Zoinks! It's the alien!! Oldbag: Who are you calling an alien!? Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Phoenix: Oh, it's just you, Ms. Oldbag. What are you doing here? Oldbag: What is wrong with young'uns today!? I came down here to pay my respects to my poor Juan, and you're disturbing me! Examine Bedroom Pearl: So that's a bed... Phoenix: Yup. It's big, but it's a bed. Pearl: Aaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft! Phoenix: (How easily children are entertained.) Floor near guitar case Phoenix: Bottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant. Pearl: These glass shards... Phoenix: They're probably from the glass vase Ms. Andrews knocked over. Guitar case Pearl: So, the Nickel Samurai's costume was in here? Phoenix: Yeah. Pearl: I can't believe Mr. Corrida went so far, just to say bad things about Mr. Engarde... Phoenix: W-Well, it was a \"press conference\", so he had to go in costume. Pearl: But weren't Mr. Engarde and Mr. Corrida friends? Phoenix: They weren't friends. They couldn't be friends because they were rivals. Pearl: So, a \"rival\" is someone who is a \"strong enemy\"!? Phoenix: (Pearls is really fired up over this... And I don't have an answer for her.) Wine glass Phoenix: It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it. Pearl: Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much. Phoenix: There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from. Talk Night of the murder Phoenix: Please talk to me about the night of the murder just one more time. Oldbag: I talked about it plenty at the trial! I was fooled, tricked... DECEIVED by that fraud of a photographer and her note! She was loitering around here with that imbecilic look on her face! Pearl: \"With that imbecilic look on her face\"... OK, got it. Oldbag: N-Now hold on a second there you little pipsqueak! If you're going to take notes, at least make me sound better than that! Pearl: Oh, alright. Phoenix: (Now I've seen everything...) Oldbag: But you know, I was working that night too, doing my job, minding my own business. So it's not like I had time to waste standing around here the whole night. Memories of Corrida Phoenix: I was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about Mr. Corrida. Oldbag: He was the most popular star, you know... Especially where it counts -- in my book! Phoenix: But I heard that he was lagging behind in the polls against Mr. Engarde... Oldbag: Um, w-well, that's just a recent thing. Bad luck and all that, you know. But! He was going to become an even bigger star than he used to be! Look! Just look at this mountain of presents! It's a show of the mountain of feelings all his fans had for him! Phoenix: Yeah, the mountain is pretty big, and certainly nothing to shake a stick at. Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Hm? What is it, Pearls? Pearl: The presents. They're all bears... right? Phoenix: (She's got a point... There isn't a single thing here that isn't a bear...) Presents (appears after \"Memories of Corrida\") Phoenix: All of Mr. Corrida's presents from his fans seem to be... bears... Oldbag: Oh, that's because you can't think of Juan without thinking about bears! Pearl: Bears...? Why bears? Oldbag: You don't know!? When my dear Juan was training, he fought barehanded with a bear. He refused to give in and let the bear win, but after the fight, they became friends. Pearl: Wow... What a heartwarming story. Oldbag: Look, it's just like in those young people's dramas. I can see those two tuckered out, down by a river going, \"Heh... You... You sure can fight...\" \"You too, bub. You too.\" Phoenix: D-Did all that really happen? Oldbag: It's in his biography, bub. Phoenix: (What a load of crock!) Oldbag: So ever since then, fans have been giving him bears as presents. Phoenix: Yeah... Nice... Bears... After clearing all Talk options and visiting Living Room: *GROOOOOOOOOOWL!* I'm Uncle Bear, and I say it's \"bearly\" 8 o'clock! Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What is that infernal racket!? Oldbag: It's one of the presents going off. Sounds like it's already 8 PM. Way past your bedtime! Phoenix: Urk... That startled me! I thought I was going to die for a second... Pearl: Eight PM... That's the time when the award ceremony ended that night, remember? Phoenix: (Time sure flies... Hard to believe it's been two days since the ceremony...) ...*beep beep beep*... Phoenix: (The transceiver!) ...*beep*... Phoenix: Hello!? Hello!? ???: ...This is not a phone. Phoenix: Maya! How is Maya!? You haven't hurt her, have you!? ???: ...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Wright.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! ???: I have heard the news. So it would seem my present did you no good... Pearl: N-Noooo! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa! Phoenix: One more day! Please! All I ask is for one more day! I... I'll get a not guilty verdict for sure this time! Please... ???: ... I suppose if I must. I need that acquittal more than anything else, after all. Phoenix: ...Please... Please let Maya say something! I want to hear she's alright! ???: Alright... hissssss... then... hisssssss... ssssssssss... ssss... a little... sssssss... Phoenix: (What is with this static all of a sudden...!) Hello!? Hello!? ???: It seems... ssssss... hisss... sssss... bad... sssssss... hisssssssssss... ssssssssss... connect...sssssssssssss... Phoenix: (Dammit! Did the transceiver just suddenly break...!?) ???: ssssssssss... 'll excuse me... hisssssssssssssssss... ...*beep*... Pearl: Wh-What happened...? Phoenix: I don't know. All of a sudden, it became nothing but static. Pearl: Aaaah... Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya! Phoenix: (Why did the transceiver suddenly break like that...? I should probably have an electronics expert look at it... The sooner the better!) March 22Wright & Co. Law Offices Gumshoe: Hey! Welcome back, pal! I thought I'd make you a little something for dinner. Phoenix: Th...That's nice... Thanks. Gumshoe: A rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is... (Changed from [It's a rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is...] in the original release) Phoenix: I'm sorry you went through all the trouble to cook, but I don't have the time to eat. Gumshoe: Oops... Looks like you don't have a can opener, pal. (Changed from [Oh, hey... You don't have a can opener here, pal.] in the original release) Phoenix: (You've got to be kidding... And here I thought he had already whipped something up.) Gumshoe: Oh, I know! There is one way I know how to be helpful! Ask me about anything you want, pal! Go ahead! Phoenix: (Well, since he's here and offering... I wonder what I should try asking him about?) Talk Electromagnetic interference (appears after correctly presenting Radio Transceiver) Leads to: \"Um... So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...?\" Present Radio Transceiver (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room) Gumshoe: The transceiver...? Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! You should ask Mr. Scruffy Detective about that thing. Gumshoe: What thing? Phoenix: Oh yeah! This thing just up and broke all of a sudden! Gumshoe: It... It broke, pal? Phoenix: When I was talking to the kidnapper, it just suddenly broke into static... Look, it sounded like this. ...*beep*... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: I don't hear any static, pal. Phoenix: H-Huh?? Pearl: Maybe it fixed itself? Phoenix: That's strange... I'm sure it was making a loud static noise. Gumshoe: Hmm... Maybe... Phoenix: Maybe what? Gumshoe: Maybe it was \"electromagnetic interference\", pal. Phoenix: \"Electromagnetic interference\"? Picture Card Phoenix: Oh yeah! Do you know about this card? Gumshoe: Card? Phoenix: Edgeworth, for some reason, went pale the instant he saw this card. Gumshoe: Hey, I know what this is, pal! Phoenix: You do? Gumshoe: No matter what way you look at it, I'd say it's a picture of a shell. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Um, that's it? Gumshoe: Oh yeah! That's right! Mr. Edgeworth really likes those cooked snail things. Um, what are they called again...? \"Escargot\" or something like that...? Pearl: Mr. Nick! I think we just solved the mystery of why Mr. Edgeworth's face turned pale, right!? Phoenix: (As I suspected, Gumshoe has no clue...) Phoenix: Um... So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...? Gumshoe: It's something that happens when a radio wave gets mixed up with another signal, pal. Phoenix: Oh, when you put it that way... Pearl: I don't understand what you're talking about... Gumshoe: Like for example, when a cell phone goes off next to a computer screen, the stuff on the screen gets kinda fuzzy and starts acting funny, right? Pearl: Huh? ...\"Kom-pu-ter\"? Gumshoe: ... Um, it's like when you use the dryer next to the TV, and the screen starts looking weird. Pearl: O-Oh, yes, the TV does do that! Hmm... Oh, so that's what you're talking about! Phoenix: (She seems amazingly happy at being able to understand this...) Gumshoe: So the room you were in when that interference to the transceiver happened... There's gotta be something there that's sending out very strong radio waves, pal! Something like... Hmm... Like a listening device or something. Phoenix: Ah! Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of that! Where were you when it happened? Pearl: We were in Mr. Corrida's room... The scene of the murder! Gumshoe: What!? That's it! I'm going to sneak into the precinct and get a bug sweeper! I'll meet you at the crime scene later, alright pal!? Phoenix: Ah, wait! Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Oh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah! Pearl: We should be going too, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Alright, let's go! Examine Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night! After clearing \"Electromagnetic interference\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices: March 22Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room Gumshoe: Hey! You're finally here, pal! Phoenix: S-Sorry to keep you waiting. Pearl: Do you have the... um... \"bug sweeper\"? Gumshoe: Um, well, you see... I got busted trying to sneak in, pal. Then suddenly, I'm staring at the precinct doors. ...From the outside, I mean. So yeah... I couldn't get one of the police bug sweepers... Phoenix: ... What do you mean you couldn't get it!? We need that item! Gumshoe: Hey, hey, calm down, pal. I didn't say I didn't get one, just not the police's. Pearl: Wow... So this is a \"bug sweeper\"... Phoenix: It looks a little... broken. Gumshoe: Hey, this was made when I was in elementary school, pal. Phoenix: Oh? By who? Gumshoe: Me, of course! Ah, seeing this sure brings back memories... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: Hey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little beat up... (Changed from [Hey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little run down...] in the original release) But I put my heart and soul into building this puppy here! Pearl: Your heart and soul...? Gumshoe: It'll work! Trust me, pal, it'll do the job! But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: But you can't set the sensitivity... So it's going to beep at anything that gives off electromagnetic waves. Pearl: But isn't it better that way? Gumshoe: Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! Well, anyway, since I brought it all this way, might as well give it a whirl, right pal? Phoenix: (I'm getting that sinking feeling again...) Gumshoe: OK, now I'll tell you how to use this baby! There's a listening device or some other sort of bug hidden in this room, pal. Pearl: So we're going to find it, right? Gumshoe: Right. Now, first, let's turn the sweeper on. Next, move the sweeper around to give the room a real thorough lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the sweeper and take a real good look around the room with it, pal.] in the original release) The sweeper'll let you know how strong of a signal it's picking up, so keep an eye on it, OK? (Changed from [You can see how strong the radio waves are in an area by looking at the CHECK gauge.] in the original release) Once you find something that's giving off a lot of radio waves... (Changed from [Once you find something that's giving off strong waves, the gauge will change...] in the original release) ...press [the A Button / Enter] to lock on to it. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the thing a long hard stare.] in the original release) There's a lot of things here that's going to give off radio waves, so let's take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Alright! I'm going to go stand outside and keep an eye out. Give me a yell if you find the bug. Got it, pal!? Bug sweeper Calculator Phoenix: It's a plain old calculator. Pearl: It says \"50\" on it. Maybe he was calculating his allowance? Phoenix: (A whole 50 cents?? Um, maybe if he was a spirit medium...) Dryer Phoenix: And here we have a dryer... Nothing unusual here, I think. Pearl: A dryer...? Oh! if you use it next to a TV, it'll make the screen look all weird right? Phoenix: ...Y-Yeah. Pearl: And when that happens, it's called \"electromagnetic interference\", right!? Phoenix: Hey, good memory Pearls! Pearl: I will never forget it for the rest of my life! Clock bear Phoenix: Well, it certainly looks like an alarm clock. Pearl: What's wrong? Why do you look troubled? Phoenix: I just can't imagine the listening device being inside this alarm clock. It just, um, sort of reminded me of something that happened a long time ago... Pearl: Oh... Phoenix: Well, anyway, it looks like the listening device isn't in here. Box next to clock bear Pearl: Wow, there's a really delicious loaf of bread in here! Phoenix: Looks like it's been on \"keep warm\" all this time since the murder. Pearl: Well, Mr. Scruffy Detective always says, \"Got to keep the trail and crime scene warm.\" Phoenix: (I think the \"keep warm\" in that case is a little more metaphorical...) Video camera Pearl: What's this? Phoenix: It's a small video camera. ...No listening device in this gizmo. Pearl: Everyone's trying to make everything smaller and smaller lately, aren't they Mr. Nick? Phoenix: That's what it seems like. Pearl: But! I want to grow bigger and bigger! Phoenix: (Well, eating only vegetables isn't going to help you there. You have to eat meat too...) Remote control Phoenix: It's the TV's remote control. But it doesn't look like the listening device is in here. Pearl: Um, so I was thinking... I wonder if a TV remote works on other things... Like... Could I make you change your expressions like TV channels? Zap! Phoenix: H-Hey! (Hmm, but if I could... Ooh, the people I would give the ol' mute button to!) Well, I don't think it's going to work on me... Why don't we try it on Maya tomorrow, OK? Pearl: ... OK! Laptop Phoenix: There's no listening device in that notebook computer, huh. Pearl: Umm... What's a \"notebook computer\"...? Phoenix: ... Do you know what a \"notebook\" is? Pearl: Yes! It's a small book with paper that you can write on! ...So? Phoenix: Well, that thing is like a notebook in a way. It's basically a small laptop. Pearl: Umm... Mr. Nick... What's a \"laptop\"...? Refrigerator Pearl: This is a... a refrigerator, right? Phoenix: I really don't think the listening device is in something like this. Pearl: Because it's filled with nothing but healty vegetable juices, right!? Phoenix: Uh, yeah, sure. (What does that have to do with listening devices?) Coffee pot Pearl: What's this? It sort of looks like a hot water pot, but... Phoenix: Oh, well, it's kind of like a hot water pot, I guess. But instead of hot water, coffee comes out. Pearl: Really!? Th-This pot can do that!? ... Um, is there a pot that orange juice comes out of...? Phoenix: I don't think there's anything like that, Pearls. Sorry. Water pot Pearl: Oh, the water in this hot water pot has run out! I'll go get more water for it! Phoenix: O-OK. Sounds good. (Looks like she's forgotten all about looking for the listening device...) Large bear near coffee machine Leads to: \"This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right?\" Air conditioner Phoenix: Well, the listening device isn't in the air conditioner. Pearl: Aah! Yuck! This air filter is covered in dust and dirt... Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Pearl: ... Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's wash it! Phoenix: (I wonder if being a neat freak makes even the tiniest dust bunny look colossal...?) Pearl: ...What? Phoenix: O-Oh, nothing. TV Phoenix: I don't really think the listening device is in the TV of all places. Pearl: Looks like the TV was left on, and it's now showing an old samurai movie. Phoenix: Yeah. This channel plays all sorts of international movies, as well as domestic ones. Pearl: You know, every time I watch one of these old movies, I always think, \"Wow, these Japanese stars are really good at English!\" Phoenix: ...Um, yeah. Pearl: When I grow up, I want to study Japanese! Phoenix: (I should probably keep my mouth shut here, and not destroy her dream...) Lamps Phoenix: Lamp, check. Listening device... nope. Pearl: There are a lot of lamps in this room, aren't there Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. Pearl: And they're all on. You shouldn't do that, Mr. Nick. Don't you know that's wasteful? Phoenix: ...Ah, yeah... I'll be more conscientious from now on. Sorry. Cell phone Phoenix: A cell phone... Nope, no bugs in here. Pearl: A \"cell phone\"...? Phoenix: Wh-What!? Don't tell me you don't know what a cell phone is! Pearl: ...I'm sorry. I've never seen one before... Phoenix: (Now that she mentions it, my cell phone couldn't get any reception while I was staying in Kurain Village... And Pearls has never lived outside of that village, so... Well, I guess I can't say it's impossible to live without one...) Landline phone Phoenix: Well, the phone is the most common place for a \"listening device\", I'd say. But, let's take the receiver apart first before we get ahead of ourselves here. Pearl: Wow, you know a lot about electronics, don't you Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, I know tons. Especially when it comes to taking them apart. It's my specialty. (I'll leave the fixing part up to Gumshoe...) Pearl: So...? Is there a \"listening device\" in there? Phoenix: ...No. (And I really thought it had to be in the phone too...) Bear between the two sofas Pearl: Ah, what a lovely bear... *GROOOOOOOOOOOOWL!* Pearl: AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! Phoenix: Ah, this must be one of those fancy bear-shaped toy robots. Pearl: I-It's a robot!? It's a REAL robot!? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, it's a real one. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Pearl: H-How many horse-powers is it? How many horsies!? Phoenix: Horsies...? ... Phoenix: Um... Well, look, it's a bear, so... uh... Pearl: Um... Radio Pearl: The radio is on and playing something. Oh! It's \"Kids' Question Corner\"! \"Professor! Professor! Why is the Earth round?\" Pearl: ... Yes, why is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... Why don't you listen to the radio program a little more, Pearls? Pearl: This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right? It's the biggest one I have ever seen! Gumshoe: Hey! So did you guys find it yet? The listening device, I mean... Pearl: No, not yet. But this bear's eye is... Gumshoe: Let's see, let's see... A perfectly normal stuffed bear with some really strong radio waves... Sounds like you found the device to me, pal. Let's dig this big fella's eye out and see what we've got. Pearl: N-No! You can't! Such... Such a violent act... Gumshoe: Oomph! *rip!* Pearl: Noooooooooo! Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Th-That's! Gumshoe: It's a miniature camera... And it looks like there's more. There's a... transmitter, and a timer. Phoenix: A whattawhatta-mitter? Gumshoe: A transmitter, pal. Pearl: Oh... Is this more of that \"high tech\" stuff...? Talk Camera Phoenix: So this tiny thing is a camera...? Gumshoe: Yup. It's a pinhole CCD camera, pal. It's a small, high-grade video camera mostly used in security systems. Phoenix: So it's a video camera... Gumshoe: It runs on a battery, which comes with it in a set. Phoenix: But... there's no video tape in this camera... Gumshoe: This is only the camera part here, pal. The tape recorder with the tape inside it is somewhere else. Pearl: Somewhere else? Gumshoe: The footage is changed into radio waves and then it's sent to that recorder. Pearl: So... It's sort of like a TV broadcast, isn't it? Gumshoe: Hey, you know, you're right! Spy Camera added to the Court Record. Camera (subsequent times) Phoenix: So this tiny thing is a camera...? Gumshoe: Yup. It's a pinhole CCD camera, pal. It's a small, high-grade video camera mostly used in security systems. Phoenix: So it's a video camera... Gumshoe: It runs on a battery, which comes with it in a set. Phoenix: But... there's no video tape in this camera... Gumshoe: This is only the camera part here, pal. The tape recorder with the tape inside it is somewhere else. Pearl: Somewhere else? Gumshoe: The footage is changed into radio waves and then it's sent to that recorder. Pearl: So... It's sort of like a TV broadcast, isn't it? Gumshoe: Hey, you know, you're right! Transmitter Phoenix: So... what is a \"transmitter\"? Gumshoe: It's a device that sends footage the camera took to a specific destination. It's like a video version of a listening device, pal. Phoenix: It looks like it's attached to a small, clock-like thing... Gumshoe: Oh, that's a timer, pal. You can set it to turn the camera on and record at a certain time with it. Pearl: You can set it for a certain time...? Gumshoe: Yup. Let's see... This looks like it was set to start at 8 PM and go for one hour. Phoenix: Eight PM? (That was the time the award ceremony ended!) Gumshoe: There's no date set, so it's been recording every night, I'd guess. Pearl: M-Mr. Detective! How long has this bear been here...? Gumshoe: Um, I'm pretty sure it's been here since the night of the murder. Pearl: Then... Then maybe... Gumshoe: Maybe this camera caught the murder on tape! Phoenix: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: And if you think about the angle the bear is at... It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal! Transmitter added to the Court Record. Transmitter (subsequent times) Phoenix: So... what is a \"transmitter\"? Gumshoe: It's a device that sends footage the camera took to a specific destination. It's like a video version of a listening device, pal. Phoenix: It looks like it's attached to a small, clock-like thing... Gumshoe: Oh, that's a timer, pal. You can set it to turn the camera on and record at a certain time with it. Pearl: You can set it for a certain time...? Gumshoe: Yup. Let's see... This looks like it was set to start at 8 PM and go for one hour. Phoenix: Eight PM? (That was the time the award ceremony ended!) Gumshoe: There's no date set, so it's been recording every night, I'd guess. Pearl: M-Mr. Detective! How long has this bear been here...? Gumshoe: Um, I'm pretty sure it's been here since the night of the murder. Pearl: Then... Then maybe... Gumshoe: Maybe this camera caught the murder on tape! Phoenix: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: And if you think about the angle the bear is at... It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal! Stuffed bear Pearl: So there was a camera... in this bear's eye... Phoenix: And it was disguised as a present. Gumshoe: And I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal. It's pretty big, so it stands out pretty well in my mind. Phoenix: But... who gave Mr. Corrida this present? Gumshoe: I, ah, don't know, pal. But! This means that someone out there's got a video of what happened here that night! Pearl: Isn't there any way we can find out who that person is? Gumshoe: It's impossible, pal. Radio waves can be sent almost anywhere, so there's no real way to find out... Pearl: Oh... *sniffle* Phoenix: (Is there really no way to find out...?) Stuffed Bear added to the Court Record. Stuffed bear (subsequent times) Pearl: So there was a camera... in this bear's eye... Phoenix: And it was disguised as a present. Gumshoe: And I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal. It's pretty big, so it stands out pretty well in my mind. Phoenix: But... who gave Mr. Corrida this present? Gumshoe: I, ah, don't know, pal. But! This means that someone out there's got a video of what happened here that night! Pearl: Isn't there any way we can find out who that person is? Gumshoe: It's impossible, pal. Radio waves can be sent almost anywhere, so there's no real way to find out... Pearl: Oh... *sniffle* Phoenix: (Is there really no way to find out...?) Present Picture Card Gumshoe: So... the assassin's name is Shelly de Killer? Phoenix: Yeah. Gumshoe: And because he's \"Shelly\", that's why he leaves a \"shell\" card? Phoenix: Yes. Gumshoe: ... Ho ho ho ho! Oh, that's great. But you know, no matter how strange I may seem, at least my jokes don't make you cringe. Right, pal? Phoenix: (Umm... Yeah, you keep on thinking that...) Spy Camera Pearl: It's a really tiiiiny camera. Gumshoe: A camera this size lasts about 3 hours with a fresh battery pack, pal. Phoenix: But what would something like this be doing in...? Gumshoe: Well, I'd say taking a secret video of the murder. Phoenix: (Which means... Someone knew there was going to be a murder here!) Transmitter Gumshoe: This device looks like it was made by the criminal themselves. If it's only sending images, then I'd say it'd last about 80 hours, pal. Pearl: You know a lot about these things, don't you Mr. Detective? Is spying on people a hobby of yours...? Gumshoe: Well, no... I mean... You're making me embarrassed, putting me on the spot like this. Phoenix: (Why should he be embarrassed? Is there something I'm not getting here...?) Stuffed Bear Pearl: The bear is really lovely, isn't it? It's so soft and fuzzy, and the face is really well-made... Phoenix: (Well, I guess when you compare it to all the other presents, it is well-made.) Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think the bear itself is a clue to this case at all. After clearing all Talk options: Gumshoe: ... ...I got it! Phoenix: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: Hey, pal. Let me borrow this mini camera for a bit! Phoenix: Wh-What are you going to do? Gumshoe: I'm going to go around to the electronic shops and see if I can find out who bought this! Phoenix: B-But that's impossible! I mean, it's already 9 PM! Gumshoe: Leave it to me! Even if I have to search all night, I'll find your man, pal! Spy Camera and Transmitter given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Oh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah! Pearl: ...He's gone. Phoenix: ...Yeah. Pearl: But Mr. Scruffy Detective sure is a nice man. He's pushing himself so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake... ???: It's a mystery how you always manage to do things in the most inefficient ways, Wright. (Changed from [...You always manage to do things in the most ineffective ways.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Ack!) Edgeworth: You'll have to excuse me. I heard your conversation just now. Phoenix: E-Edgeworth! What are you doing here!? Edgeworth: A rescue team has been created and deployed. I can't say I'm optimistic... but we have to move forward, one step at a time. Phoenix: I-I see... Thanks. Edgeworth: Don't thank me yet. We still have to find her. Pearl: ... Edgeworth: Hmm... So, there was a spy camera hidden inside this stuffed animal, huh? You are one lucky man, Wright. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: Do you know this stuffed bear, little girl? Pearl: Um... I have no idea! Edgeworth: Hmph... Of course not. The maker of this bear is a very expensive, luxury brand from overseas. It's completely hand-made, and only a small number of these are exported here. (Changed from [It's completely hand-made and there are very few that are exported here.] in the original release) Phoenix: Wh-What? Edgeworth: The camera and transmitter that scatterbrained detective took with him are dead ends. Things like those can be bought anywhere... However, this bear is different. By tracking how it got into this country, this bear can tell us who the buyer is. Pearl: C-Can you really do that!? Mr. Nick, can he really? Phoenix: W-Well, I guess so... Edgeworth: Hmm... It's 9 PM. I think I can still make it in time. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: I'll be taking this for now. I'm sure you have other things you have to do. Stuffed Bear snatched up by Edgeworth. Edgeworth: See you soon, Wright. Phoenix: W-Wait! Edgeworth: What? Phoenix: Why are you doing this...? Edgeworth: ... I have no interest in explaining myself to someone who cannot comprehend. But besides that, Wright. Until court reconvenes tomorrow, you should concern yourself with this question: \"Who was the person that murdered Juan Corrida?\" Phoenix: The \"real killer\"... Edgeworth: Do you really still think it was Adrian Andrews? Phoenix: To be honest... I don't know anymore. Edgeworth: ... You still have a little time left... Find the truth, Wright. Everything begins with the truth. Phoenix: (Juan Corrida's real killer... Ms. Andrews' past... The kidnapper whose sole condition is an acquittal for Mr. Engarde... And... this card. Shelly de Killer...) ...Maya. The only way I can save you now, is to find all the answers to this case tonight! I don't understand what your real intentions are, Edgeworth... but as you said, all I can do for now is find the truth! To be continued. March 22, 9:14 PMGatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room Pearl: It's past 9:00 PM already, isn't it? I wonder... I wonder if Mr. Edgeworth has already found Mystic Maya...? Phoenix: (These things take time. I'd say probably not...) The police are professionals, Pearls. They'll find her, so don't you worry. And if we can win a not guilty verdict tomorrow... then everything will be OK. Pearl: Y-You're right... ... Talk The real killer Phoenix: So the real person who killed Mr. Corrida was... Pearl: That assassin... Mr. Shelly de Killer, right? Phoenix: And the card Ms. Andrews found at the crime scene seems to be proof of that. But if that's the case, then a new question comes to mind. Who was the one that hired De Killer to begin with? Who is his client? Pearl: You mean... Who asked for the murder...? Phoenix: That person didn't want to dirty their own hands in blood, but whoever this client is, they're still a killer. Pearl: ... The assassin's client Pearl: Who... Who could have hired the assassin? Do you think it was Ms. Andrews...? Phoenix: (I wonder... But if she was the client... then why go through the effort to stab the knife into the corpse herself...?) Pearl: But if Ms. Andrews wasn't the client... Then... No, it can't be... Phoenix: (...Matt Engarde himself...?) Was it Matt? (appears after \"The real killer\" and \"The assassin's client\") Pearl: If Mr. Engarde really did hire the assassin... Phoenix: Then he is not innocent at all. Far from it, he would be guilty of the crime. Pearl: B-But it can't be Mr. Engarde, right!? I mean, when we first talked with him... Phoenix: ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida? Engarde: ... Alright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK? Phoenix: (I didn't see any Psyche-Locks at that time... Actually... That reminds me...) Pearl: Did you remember something, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, something Ms. Andrews said at the trial today. She said something interesting. Something interesting (appears after \"Was it Matt?\") Pearl: Um... So what is this \"interesting thing\"? Phoenix: Oh, that's right. You didn't hear it, did you Pearls? Andrews: Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway. Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed! Pearl: Mr. Engarde's \"secret\"...!? Wh-What is this secret...? Phoenix: I don't know yet. But for now, let's think about it this way. Mr. Corrida was going to reveal this \"secret\". That means... Mr. Engarde had plenty of motive to have Mr. Corrida silenced. ... (Which means we have to meet with Mr. Engarde. There's no way around it now.) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: I... I believe in your lawyer powers, Mr. Nick. I know you can bring us a miracle. Phoenix: (I'm guessing by \"miracle\", she means a not guilty verdict... And she wouldn't be wrong either. It will take a miracle to pull this one off.) Radio Transceiver Pearl: Why... Why did the kidnapper have to take Mystic Maya...? Why couldn't he have taken me instead!? Phoenix: Stop it, Pearls! Don't say things like that! If that had happened, then Maya would be hurting, I'm sure of it. Just like how you are hurting now, Pearls. Pearl: Y-You're right... Maya Fey profile Pearl: One more day... Phoenix: Yeah... If we can bring the trial to its end, she'll be back. Don't worry. Pearl: I decided I won't cry anymore, Mr. Nick. You're so brave and holding strong for Mystic Maya, so I have to do the same. Pearl Fey profile Pearl: If only I had studied harder during my training... I could be a bigger help to you, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Ah, don't worry about it. Really. Pearls, you're doing a great job... Pearl: Mr. Nick! Is there a waterfall around here!? I feel that I must be made new under the rushing spring waters! Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... The only body of water around here is a lake. Pearl: Oh... Thanks anyway... Dick Gumshoe profile Pearl: This is the first time I've ever met someone who loves to eat instant noodles. Phoenix: (Something tells me Gumshoe isn't eating them because he genuinely likes them, but...) Pearl: He's working so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake... I'm going to get him lots and lots of instant noodles as a thank your present! Juan Corrida profile Pearl: Um... Is it really that important to be the Master of all the Stars? So important that you try to find your friends' weaknesses, and then expose them...? Phoenix: I... I wouldn't know... Matt Engarde profile Pearl: I-Is it really alright for us to trust him? This person... Mr. Engarde...? Phoenix: ... (I-I don't know... I can't even answer that for myself. We have to go see him one more time! That's the only way to know for sure!) Security Lady profile Pearl: Um... I was wondering if that old lady is really a person from Earth. I mean, maybe she's really from waaaaaay out in outer space... Phoenix: Yeah, actually, I was thinking the same exact thing. She's too strange to be from Earth. Adrian Andrews profile Pearl: Why did Ms. Andrews... Why did she frame Mr. Engarde, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (She has some sort of grudge against Mr. Engarde... But why is that? That's something we still have to figure out...) Let's go ask her, OK? Celeste Inpax profile Pearl: This person was Ms. Andrews' mentor... And she... killed herself, right? Phoenix: (Right. And Mr. Corrida hid Ms. Inpax's suicide note... So to get it back, Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... But the thing is, where is that suicide note now?) March 22Gatewater HotelHallway Pearl: Wow, it's really getting late, isn't it Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. It's past 9:00 PM already. But we still have some things to prepare for tomorrow's trial. (There's still the matter of this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida held about Mr. Engarde... And Ms. Andrews' real intentions. These are two things I must know tonight!) Pearl: But aren't visiting hours over at the detention center? Phoenix: Hmm... I'm sure we'll think of something, Pearls. Don't you worry. March 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall Oldbag: ... Phoenix: Hey! Wait! Oldbag: What is it, whippersnapper!? All I know is nothing that has anything to do with you is ever good! Like just now. I was handed this strange device for who knows what reason. And I was told to use it to search the whole hotel. Phoenix: That's... the bug sweeper, isn't it? (The one Gumshoe made...) Oldbag: I don't know and frankly, I don't care. But the request came from Edgey-poo, so... Phoenix: Edgeworth...? Oldbag: And he said, Edgeworth: \"If you feel angry, direct your anger at that unsophisticated lawyer.\" Oldbag: So, I'm going to feel free to direct all my anger towards you! Phoenix: (Ugh... Gee, thanks a bundle, Edgeworth! What a pal you are!) Examine Tables at back Phoenix: They haven't cleaned up all the food yet. Oldbag: Don't you touch it without permission! I brought a lunch box today, so I could pack it. Pearl: Um... But... Hasn't the food been out for two days already? Oldbag: When it's in your stomach, it's all the same! Phoenix: (Wow, the digestive powers of an alien are wondrous...) Front table Pearl: I want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again... Phoenix: Yeah, me too... Pearl: Whenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot. Phoenix: Well, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast! Oldbag: My mind's like a steel trap, so I'm going to hold you to that! Phoenix: (I was NOT talking to you!) Talk Bug sweeper Oldbag: This is absolutely top secret, so you had better keep it to yourselves! I heard they found a spy camera hidden in one of the presents! Phoenix: Hmm, very interesting. Oldbag: I'm sure it was... you know... It was to catch poor Juan in the middle of a scandalous \"meeting\"! Pearl: \"Scandalous\"...? What's that? Oldbag: It means... Well, you know, that gossip that's been going around about my dear Juan. Phoenix: Oh... You mean that thing about Ms. Andrews. (But I'm sure she must've had some reason for getting close to Mr. Corrida...) Oldbag: I'll let you in on another secret, young'un. I know who planted that spy camera! It was that obnoxious, puffy-haired photographer girl! The nerve of some people! Spying on people by herself! As if I wouldn't want to see it for myself too! Phoenix: (Wow! The alien actually admitted her true intentions for a change!) Oldbag: I don't know what you're thinking exactly, but I can bet that it's nothing good!! Phoenix: (But I didn't say anything...) Juan and Adrian Oldbag: So you want to know about Juan and that manager, right? Actually, as I hear it, they were something of a refreshing pair, those two. Phoenix: Oh? Oldbag: I tell you, Juan really welcomed that manager with open arms, I heard. Pearl: That \"manager\"...? Who are you talking about? Oldbag: You don't know? That manager woman Juan had. It's a shame she killed herself, though... Phoenix: Oh, you're talking about Ms. Celeste Inpax... Ms. Andrews' mentor, right? Oldbag: Yes, yes, that's the one! That Celeste girl. She was supposed to get married, you know. Phoenix: M-Married? You mean... to Mr. Corrida? Oldbag: *sigh* Really, you young kids today don't know anything, do you? That girl Celeste killed herself three days after their marriage announcement! Phoenix: (Three days after their marriage announcement!? What in the...!?) Celeste's suicide (appears after \"Juan and Adrian\") Pearl: Why would Ms. Inpax want to kill herself!? She was going to get married! Oldbag: Well, that's because... she was thrown away, you see, by Juan. Phoenix: What!? Pearl: B-But... They were going to get married, right? They promised each other, right? Oldbag: They held a grand announcement session... But... Three days later... Juan suddenly cancelled their marriage. Phoenix: I-Is that true? Oldbag: It was in the weekly magazines. Pearl: B-But why!? Why did he do that!? Oldbag: That was not in the magazines, unfortunately. Phoenix: ...I see. Oldbag: That night after Juan called off the wedding, that manager, Celeste, killed herself. Phoenix: How terrible... Pearl: I wonder what happened between those two...? March 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby Phoenix: On that night, there must've been at least a few hundred people here. Hmm... I guess the police are done with their questioning and investigating. It looks like things here in the lobby have finally calmed down. Examine Second floor Phoenix: A lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. When the murder happened, it was abuzz with people running back and forth... But now since things have quieted down, it actually feels more eerie than before. March 22Engarde MansionLiving Room Phoenix: It looks like no one is around... Pearl: Um, what happened to that person with the stuffed teddy face...? Phoenix: (Oh, she must mean that butler with the stitches in his face.) Pearl: Shoooooe! Shoe: Meow. Pearl: Oh, there you are. I guess you're still awake, huh Shoe? Shoe: Meow. Pearl: Hee hee, come on, let's play. Phoenix: (I wonder if that butler, Mr. Doe, is already asleep or not...) March 22Wright & Co. Law Offices Pearl: It doesn't look like Mr. Scruffy Detective is here. Phoenix: Well, he's out there with that camera asking around at all the electronic stores. Pearl: Then, I'll make some salad for him for dinner. Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls really appreciates what Gumshoe is doing for us...) Pearl: ...Um, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Hm? Yes? Pearl: Where is the lettuce? Phoenix: ...I don't think I've ever bought lettuce before. Pearl: ... Aww, I guess I have to give up on making a salad, then. Phoenix: (Guess the lack of lettuce is kind of a problem.) Examine Charley the plant Pearl: Oh! I'll water it! Phoenix: Ah, it's OK... Gumshoe already gave it more than plenty earlier... Pearl: ...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...? Phoenix: (Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...) Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh, I'll wipe it some more and make it super shiny! ...The wiping cloth... Where are you, Mr. wiping cloth...? Phoenix: It's fine. Really. If you wipe it any more, it'll be so shiny I'll be using it as a mirror. March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Visiting hours ended a few hours ago. Looks like we're not going to get a chance to talk with Mr. Engarde tonight... Pearl: B-But... Isn't what we have to ask very important? Phoenix: (Yeah, but I don't think that matters to the guard...) Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Visiting hours ended hours ago, so what's the camera watching over now? Pearl: Maybe it's watching the Mr. Policeman who's standing over there. Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think that's it...) Guard Phoenix: Visiting hours ended hours ago, so what's he watching over now? Pearl: Maybe he did something bad and he's standing there as punishment. Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think that's it...) March 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Pearl: It feels sort of tense in here, doesn't it Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (Yeah, it does. I wonder if something happened...?) Chief: You're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, right? Phoenix: Ah, yes sir. Chief: Well, we've finally found just the person we've been looking for. A real decisive witness. Phoenix: A \"decisive witness\"? You mean for Mr. Engarde's case? Chief: We're taking the witness's statement right now. Gotta hand it to Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: (What's Edgeworth up to now...?) Pearl: Wh-Who is this witness? Chief: I think you know this person quite well, Mr. Lawyer. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: (Between the kidnapper's demand and now this... I can't see any way to win here!) Chief: Oh, yeah... Mr. Edgeworth wanted me to tell you something. Phoenix: He did? Chief: Even though visiting hours are long over at the detention center, he wanted me to grant you special permission, so there you go. Pearl: What!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release) Chief: I've already called them so they know. Go on, go talk to your heart's content. Phoenix: Thank you very much. Pearl: This is such good news, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (\"Go talk to your heart's content\"? It sounds like the police are pretty sure they have tomorrow's trial in the bag.) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"It seems as though my true face has been revealed... I was an elite businessman who made deals with the entire world! I was the young successor and CEO of a colossal corporate conglomeration! But my real self is that of a regular everyday policeman!\" Phoenix: ... Stop doing image training, and get yourself out there in the field!! Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: Whaaat!? \"The real killer in the Corrida murder is an assassin...\"!? This must be someone's idea of a joke. I can't believe this garbage! Phoenix: (Have a little more faith in your own subordinates!) Blue Badger Chief: This mascot here is the \"Blue Badger\". I made him, you know. I'm finally gonna show him off to the Chief of Police tomorrow. Phoenix: Wow, that's really something. Chief: You have no idea how much time and effort I invested into him to get this far... But my hopes for this little guy go far beyond just this precinct, yessiree. I'll get him deployed to every precinct in the nation. Just you wait. Pearl: I wish you luck, sir. After clearing \"Something interesting\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room, clearing \"Celeste's suicide\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Hotel Lobby, and visiting Criminal Affairs Dept.: March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (I'm sure they must have transferred Ms. Andrews here by now... So that means that both Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews are in this detention center. Now then, whose story do I want to hear?) Matt Engarde Engarde: Dude! It's Mr. Wright! I hope you can get me off the hook tomorrow. I'm counting on you! Phoenix: I... hope so too... (Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me by saying... (Changed from [Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me and said...] in the original release) that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that the assassin's client is... (Changed from [that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that assassin's client is...] in the original release) this man... Matt Engarde...) Engarde: What's wrong? Phoenix: ...Mr. Engarde. There is something I must know with one hundred percent certainty. Engarde: Hmm, you seem kinda different. You're totally not like your usual lawyer dude self. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitor's the visitor's room. He's sleeping standing up. The night's pretty long, and he probably got tired. Hmm... I hope he doesn't fall over... Talk Matt's secret Phoenix: Um, about the \"press conference\"... Engarde: You mean the one where Juan was gonna dress up as the Nickel Samurai? Phoenix: Yeah. I heard a little more about it from Ms. Andrews. Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed! Engarde: ... Phoenix: Could you please fill me in on what this \"secret\" is? Please? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew this was coming...) Pearl: Mr. Nick? D-Don't tell me... Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks...) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock...] in the original release) Engarde: You said a \"secret\", right? But I don't have any idea what it is. Do you dude...? (Changed from [You said a 'secret', right? But you don't have any idea what it is, do you dude...?] in the original release) Matt's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: This is a very important matter! Please! You must tell me! What is this \"secret\"!? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Engarde: Hmm... Well... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult my lawyer, OK? Phone: ............ ...*beep*... Phoenix: H-Hello? This is Phoenix Wright. Engarde: Oh, hey Mr. Lawyer dude. Sorry, but you know dude, you totally don't have any idea. And I really didn't care at all about what Juan was up to, OK? Phone: ...*beep*... Engarde: So, it's like that. Phoenix: ... (Looks like I have no choice but to remove those Psyche-Locks...) Juan and Adrian Phoenix: Did you know about Mr. Corrida and Ms. Andrews' relationship...? Engarde: Well, it's all over the tabloids, dude. Ah, but I don't know any of the details, if that's what you mean. Look, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't care what Juan did with his life. Phoenix: Ms. Andrews... She had a purpose in mind when she started seeing Mr. Corrida. Her mentor was Mr. Corrida's manager... and Ms. Andrews was going to get Ms. Celeste Inpax's suicide note from him. Engarde: Celeste... Phoenix: Does that jog any memories...? Engarde: ... Dude, I suddenly just got totally hungry. You up for a pizza? My treat. Engarde: ... ... Pearl: Um... Mr. Nick? What's a \"pea-za\"? Is it a kind of pea, like green peas? Phoenix: Let's go eat one later, OK? Engarde: ...Argh, I got cut off by the pizza dude at the shop. Phoenix: That's too bad... Engarde: Well, how about we get our minds off of this topic and talk about something else, OK? Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde... Are you connected to Ms. Inpax's suicide in some way...?) Present Press Conference Ticket Engarde: That Juan... Posing as someone else and trying to hold a press conference...! And the person who set it all up was Adrian, wasn't it? Phoenix: That's what I heard. Engarde: Argh... I can't believe... Why would she do such a thing, dude!? Radio Transceiver Engarde: That's a very nice transceiver, dude. I'm kind of an expert in gadgety things... Phoenix: (Why does what he just said give me a sinking feeling?) Pearl: ? Guitar Case Engarde: His signature item was a guitar. Hah! I mean, dude, what kind of ninja carries a guitar!? Phoenix: Um, I'm not someone who would know... Engarde: Dude, it's such a kid thing to do. I mean, just my opinion and all. Phoenix: (Isn't your show a kid's show too?) Crime Photo Engarde: He was a bit of a talentless hack when he was alive... But who knew he could play dead so well? Wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: W-Well, that's because he really IS dead! Engarde: And quite pitifully indeed, yes? Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo Engarde: That Adrian... I never thought she'd go this far to frame me for the crime... I mean, what does she have against me? Dude, I don't get it. Phoenix: That's something I would like to know too. Do you have any ideas at all? Even the slightest clue? Engarde: Huh!? What!? Me!? D-Don't be silly, Mr. Lawyer dude! How am I supposed to know something like that? Suicide Report or Celeste Inpax profile Engarde: ... Phoenix: ...Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Dude, I know I asked you to be my lawyer and all... But I don't think I have to tell you anything and everything. Phoenix: Um... What do you mean by that? Engarde: It just means I don't have to tell you anything and everything, dude. Pearl: ... Attempted Suicide Report Phoenix: Um, about this... Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! You can't! Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Ms. Andrews said she doesn't want anyone to know about that, remember? Engarde: What's that? Phoenix: Oh, this? Um... Nothing. It's nothing, really. Picture Card Phoenix: (... I'm kind of scared to show him this card...) Engarde: What's wrong, dude? Phoenix: Oh, um... So about this picture card... Have you ever seen this before? Engarde: ...? Nope, never saw it before in my life, dude. Phoenix: (I don't think he's lying... Or is he...? Then again, he looked like he gasped just now... Maybe I'm seeing things...?) Engarde: ? Juan Corrida profile Engarde: It's true we debuted at the same time... so that's why people were always comparing us. But I totally didn't care what people were saying because he wasn't even close, dude. I mean, I won every contest we ever had, hands down! Adrian Andrews profile Engarde: I don't get it... Why would she want to frame me...? I mean, I've never done anything to her, dude... Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde sounds pretty sincere and he seems trustworthy... So I have to find out what Ms. Andrews' real intentions are!) John Doe profile Phoenix: About this person... Engarde: ...H-He's... Pearl: He is your butler, Mr. Doe, right? We met him at your mansion. Engarde: Oh... Yes, that's right. He's a pretty cool dude who can do lots of things. He takes real good care of me. Anything else Phoenix: Could you please take a look at this...? I know it may not seem important to you... Engarde: Well, if it's not important, then I'd rather be in bed. If I don't get my 12 hours of beauty sleep, my skin's gonna wrinkle up like a prune, dude. Pearl: You know, he's right Mr. Nick. Your skin's kind of drying up here and there. Phoenix: (I swear... After this case is over, I'm going to get lots and lots of sleep...) Adrian Andrews Andrews: ..Oh, it's you. Phoenix: I'm sorry to be visiting at such a late hour. But there are a few questions I absolutely have to ask you tonight. Andrews: Me? I thought your client was Matt. Phoenix: (I'm sure Ms. Andrews knows something... She can't be clueless about this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida had on Mr. Engarde...) Andrews: ... Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: I'd like to ask you about Matt Engarde, if you don't mind... Andrews: Mr. Wright... You still don't know, do you? The real him, I mean... Phoenix: ... You seem to bear a lot of resentment towards Mr. Engarde. If that's the case, then why did you become his manager? And why would you become intimate with his rival? Andrews: ... That... has nothing to do with this case. Nothing. Celeste Inpax Phoenix: About Ms. Celeste Inpax... Andrews: I had finally put her death behind me... And now, thanks to you, it's all come back to the surface. Phoenix: I... I'm sorry. Andrews: Yes, I was shocked by her suicide. And it's true that when I heard the rumor that Juan was the one who had hidden her suicide note, I began to draw close to him. I wanted to get her suicide note back... and to burn it. Phoenix: You wanted to \"burn it\"? But why? Andrews: I didn't want it to spread like just another piece of gossip. But... I never held any murderous intent towards Juan. I would never do something so stupid. Phoenix: (The suicide note, huh...? I wonder what it said?) Why frame him? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Celeste Inpax\") Phoenix: Why did you try to frame Mr. Engarde? Andrews: That's simple. Because he's the killer, that's why. Isn't it the duty of every good citizen to inform the police? Pearl: B-But... there had to be another way. Phoenix: The police are excellent at doing their job, so they'd figure it out, right? Andrews: Yes, they're so good that they couldn't figure out the real truth behind Celeste's death. Pearl: Ms. Andrews... Phoenix: Well, um, I know you're not the type of person to do something without a reason, so please, tell me why you did what you did... Andrews: ...Revenge. Pearl: Huh...? Did you say something just now...? 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (A Psyche-Lock, huh...) Andrews: Don't you understand yet? You're not my lawyer. To be honest, you're more like my enemy. Pearl: But... Phoenix: (I'm sure I just heard Ms. Andrews say, \"Revenge\".) Why frame him? (subsequent times) Phoenix: Why did you frame Mr. Engarde...? 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Andrews: Hmm, I wonder why...? I don't really know myself. When I realized what I was doing, I had already stabbed the knife into the body. Phoenix: (I'm almost sure that just now... Ms. Andrews muttered, \"Revenge\" to herself.) Present Press Conference Ticket Andrews: I was the one who organized the whole press conference. Juan wanted to deal the most damage possible to Matt's career. And that's why he was killed. It's quite simply a story of cause and effect, yes? Magazine Clipping Andrews: It appears to me that rumor was started by Juan himself. Phoenix: Mr. Corrida...? But... Andrews: I'm Matt's manager, remember. I think he wanted to embarrass Matt through his relationship with me. Pearl: But... But didn't Mr. Corrida like you...!? Andrews: There weren't any feelings of love between us. For me, it was about getting Celeste's suicide note... For him, it was about wounding Matt's pride. That's all it was. Pearl: That's... That's... Phoenix: (Poor Pearls is in shock. She sees just how cruel the world can really be.) Guitar Case Phoenix: So there was a Nickel Samurai costume inside of this case, correct? Andrews: Yes, there was. I even personally carried it here from the studio. I always thought it was such a childish thing to dress up and wear a costume like that, but I never thought that I would wind up using it myself that night. Wine Glass Andrews: When I was pouring that glass of juice... I honestly had no idea that Juan was dead... Pearl: I see... Andrews: I really am a terrible woman, aren't I? One moment, I'm thinking of looking after him, and the next, I'm stabbing him in the chest with a knife. Crime Photo Phoenix: About this photo... Andrews: The person who stabbed the body and opened the guitar case was me. Phoenix: And that was so you could get the Nickel Samurai's costume out so you could wear it...? Andrews: I thought I had executed that part quite well. But you showed me differently. You are a formidable lawyer, Mr. Wright. Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo Andrews: You know... There was only one thought running through my head at that time. \"With this, I can finally expose Matt's true nature to the world.\" Phoenix: (His \"true nature\"...? I wonder why she's saying that, but not telling me what his true nature is? If it were me, I think I'd be happy to finally get that kind of thing off my chest.) Suicide Report Andrews: I don't care what the reason was... It's unforgivable that he hid Celeste's suicide note. Phoenix: But you don't have any proof that she left a suicide note behind, right? Andrews: Celeste... She always believed there was a right way and a wrong way to do anything. She would have left a note. I... I wholly believe that. Attempted Suicide Report Andrews: S-Stop it! I don't want to remember the hopelessness and the despair I felt back then! Pearl: Hurry up and put that away, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: I-I'm so sorry! Picture Card Andrews: It was near Juan's dead body. I... I noticed it when I went to fill the glass. And then when I realized that Juan was dead... I completely panicked. That's when I must have unconsciously picked this card up and put it into my pocket. As for why...? I simply don't know. Will Powers profile Andrews: That's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be. Phoenix: (Urk... What a horrible thing to say...) Andrews: ...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright. Juan Corrida profile Andrews: He is a very prideful man... Or rather, was. He absolutely had to compete with Matt in everything, no matter what it was. He really was such an idiot. Pearl: Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: Well, I guess maybe all stars are like that. Never giving any thought to other people's feelings. Matt Engarde profile Andrews: ... Pearl: Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: That things have come to this... I have nothing left to say about that man. Not one word. Adrian Andrews profile Andrews: I hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why. Phoenix: S-Sorry... Celeste Inpax profile Andrews: Celeste... was my mentor. She was a strong woman... She wouldn't kill herself over any old trifling matter... Pearl: S-So... You have some ideas of why she killed herself...? Andrews: Yes, I suppose... Anything else Phoenix: Um, I'd like to ask you about this... Andrews: I told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me. Phoenix: (Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...) Detention Center (subsequent visits, before clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co.

Mr. Wright! Please, you have to help me! Phoenix: (Uh oh...) M-Mr. Powers! Pearl: What happened? Why are you here? Powers: I-I... Uh, you see, I got roped into this somehow... Pearl: What?? Powers: And now I'm going to testify at tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: (So the decisive witness... is Mr. Powers?) Powers: I was talking with a detective until a little while ago, and I was on my way home... When all of a sudden, \"You there! You're under arrest!\" And I was brought back here. Phoenix: O-Oh. Powers: They said my face and whole self in general looked \"suspicious\" or something. Phoenix: (Hmm... Well, I guess I can see how they thought you looked suspicious...) Powers: *sigh* I'm just a normal guy on an exercise show for kids... Is that a crime?? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"...I... I'm sorry, everyone. I've lied to you all... I... I'm not a detective. I'm really... I'm really... I'm really Global Hero Onyankopon!\" Phoenix: ... I think he's lost his grip on what's real and what isn't... Talk Tomorrow's testimony Phoenix: So, about this \"testimony\" you're giving. What are you going to talk about? Powers: Ah, I really don't know yet... But it sounds like I saw something pretty important from what they tell me. Phoenix: You saw something important? What was it? Powers: Ah, well, the detective told me not to talk about it. \"You can't tell anyone, and especially not that lawyer,\" he said. Pearl: Who do you think is \"that lawyer\" the detective was talking about...? Phoenix: I'm going to take a wild guess and say it's me. Powers: ...Y-Yeah, you got it. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya and myself are your only two allies in this whole world, but it's alright! Phoenix: (Ouch... I don't really have a lot of friends, do I...?) Matt Engarde Powers: This is going to do a lot of damage to Matt, you know. Because he's got that \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image going. Phoenix: But what is he really like? Powers: Well, let's see. Matt's always been kind of a \"player\" with women... He would never really turn a pretty face away, if you know what I mean... He'd always say, \"It's just a game\" to justify himself. Pearl: What!? H-How horrible! That's unforgivable! Powers: Oww. S-Sorry. Didn't mean to offend you. But you know, he said once that, \"There's only one person in the world who won't swoon over me.\" Phoenix: One person who wouldn't swoon over him? Powers: His manager, you know. Ms. Adrian Andrews. Phoenix: (Why is Mr. Powers suddenly looking kind of... energetic?) Gossip Powers: Ah, you see, I'm actually a sucker for gossip. I mean, celebrities and their world have this dazzling sort of image, right? Phoenix: A dazzling sort of image? But aren't you a part of that dazzle, Mr. Powers? Powers: No, I'm more of a hairy, sweaty, smelly, brutish kind of guy, you see. But it's OK, really. I get to hear plenty of gossip about a lot of the other stars around me as things happen. Phoenix: Well, that's true. Powers: Oh, hey! So did you hear about this yet? About Ms. Andrews' mentor and her suicide...? Phoenix: You mean Ms. Inpax? Pearl: We heard something about how her wedding was cancelled... Powers: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! I thought about it a little the other day! About that mysterious death! Hey, Mr. Wright! Why don't you ask me about that!? Go on, go ahead! Phoenix: (Mr. Powers is so charged up his skin is practically glowing with electricity...) Celeste's suicide (appears after \"Gossip\") Powers: Hey, so have you heard this? Celeste left a suicide note! And they say that Juan went and hid it... Phoenix: We heard about that in court today. (But there wasn't any actual proof that she had left a note...) Powers: Well, this is what I think. I think that something bad was written on that note. Something bad for Juan, that is. Pearl: Something bad for Mr. Corrida? Phoenix: Why do you figure so? Powers: Well, before she died, Celeste talked with a few of her friends. And she said, \"It looks like I got caught up with a truly insidious man...\" (Changed from [And she said, 'It looks like I may have been caught by an insidious man...'] in the original release) Phoenix: A \"truly insidious man\"...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that? (Changed from [An 'insidious man'...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that?] in the original release) Powers: Well, there's no one else that fits the bill, right? And that would be reason enough for him to hide the suicide note! Phoenix: I see... Well, that's some good info. Thank you. Powers: Y-You're welcome! Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews; they're both at the detention center right now. There are still things I don't understand or know about, I'm sure... I have to get the two of them to tell me everything!) Present Radio Transceiver Powers: Um... That kidnapper... Has he said anything since then...? Phoenix: Well... He tried, but there was a lot of interference. Powers: I see... Phoenix: (That radio interference... Who would've thought it was caused by a spy camera?) Magazine Clipping Powers: Hey! That article! Is that from \"Gossip Land\"? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I guess so. Powers: Ah, you too? I absolutely love this magazine! Phoenix: Um... \"You too\"...? Powers: Oh, they wrote a little something about me once! \"Steel Samurai's Midnight Dine and Dash\". Pearl: Dine and dash...? Powers: I bought ten copies of that issue, you know. Phoenix: (Do you think we could somehow get back to THIS article...?) Guitar Case Powers: The Jammin' Ninja made me want a bright red guitar, you know. I wanted to be cool like him, so I went out and bought one. Phoenix: Oh... That's nice... Powers: Ah, but you don't understand. I can't get a single sound to come out of it. Because I sort of tripped on it and crushed it... the day after I bought it. Wine Glass, Crime Photo, Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo Powers: I can't believe Ms. Andrews tried to frame Matt... Those two have such a strange relationship with each other, don't they? Phoenix: (Looks like Mr. Powers is just as in the dark about things as I am. I guess I don't have a choice other than to go talk to the two of them myself.) Adrian Andrews profile Powers: Hey, that's Ms. Andrews! She's Matt's manager. Actually, I was interested in her for a little bit. Just a little... Phoenix: (Hmm... So Mr. Powers likes this type of woman...) What do you know about Ms. Andrews...? Powers: Well, see... Here's the thing. I don't really KNOW her know her... you know? Ah! If you're interested, I can give you a little bit of the details! Phoenix: (He's so happy, he looks like a lion that's just found his next meal...) Celeste Inpax profile Powers: That's Juan's former manager, right? Celeste Inpax... She was with Global Studios for a while way back when... But some things happened and she ended up moving over to Worldwide Studios. Pearl: \"Some things\"? As in? Powers: Well, there's no one left around who knows the details, you know. Only rumors are left now. Any other profile Powers: Umm... I'm honored you're asking me, I don't know anything special about this person... Umm... Sorry... Phoenix: Ah, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much. Powers: S-Sorry.

Phoenix: The bear... Gumshoe: I figured it out, pal! I figured that we should've been looking into the bear instead of the camera! Pearl: Um... Wasn't that Mr. Edgeworth that figured... Phoenix: Shh, Pearls. ...And? Go on. Gumshoe: There's only one person who bought one of those bears who's related to this crime! Pearl: Wh-Who is it!? Who would be so rude as to spy on another person in their room...? Gumshoe: ...Matt Engarde. Pearl: Huh? Gumshoe: Matt Engarde. Your client, that's who, pal! Phoenix: (And here I thought things couldn't get any worse...) Talk Stuffed bear Phoenix: Are you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was... Gumshoe: I heard it from the department store clerk, pal. This is the credit card receipt for the purchase. It's for $3,800, pal. That's an exact match to the price of that stuffed bear. Phoenix: A receipt...? That's all you have? Gumshoe: Nah, it's not just the receipt, pal. The store clerk said so himself. He told me, \"I'm sure I sold the bear to Mr. Engarde.\" I mean, the clerk even got Mr. Engarde's autograph out of it, pal. So I'm sure the person that bought the stuffed bear was Mr. Engarde himself! Phoenix: (My... My sight is failing me... Th-This can't be!) Credit Card Receipt added to the Court Record. Stuffed bear (subsequent times) Phoenix: Are you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was... Gumshoe: I heard it from the department store clerk, pal. This is the credit card receipt for the purchase. It's for $3,800, pal. That's an exact match to the price of that stuffed bear. Phoenix: A receipt...? That's all you have?

Gumshoe: Ah, that was a dead end, pal. I mean, you can get this kind of thing from anywhere. But for now, I guess I can give these back to you for you to file away into evidence. Spy Camera, Transmitter, and Stuffed Bear refiled into the Court Record. Spy camera (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what about the spy camera we found...? Gumshoe: Ah, that was a dead end, pal. I mean, you can get this kind of thing from anywhere. But for now, I guess I can give these back to you for you to file away into evidence. Present Radio Transceiver Gumshoe: Have you heard anything from the kidnapper...? Phoenix: Nope. Not a word since we were cut off by the radio interference. Gumshoe: Well, we know his goal is to get an acquittal for Matt Engarde... So, I don't think he'll hurt Maya, because that's not going to help him at all. Come on! We can't lose hope, pal! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Transmitter, Stuffed Bear, or Spy Camera Gumshoe: That Engarde... What was he thinking? Phoenix: You mean setting the spy camera up in the victim's room...? Gumshoe: Yeah! And it was recording at the time of the murder too, pal. Don't you find that just a tad suspicious? It doesn't sound like a coincidence to me... Pearl: ... Gumshoe: Ah! I mean, don't mind me! I didn't mean it that way, pal... Phoenix: (Then what \"way\" did you mean it?) Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: My impression of her has totally changed, pal. Phoenix: Hmm... I wonder what she is doing right now...? Gumshoe: I'm sure she's still being questioned. She sure got herself into quite a big mess trying to frame Mr. Engarde. She'll probably be spending the night at the detention center... Phoenix: (Yeah, that's right. She's still at the detention center.) After clearing all Talk options: Gumshoe: I know you don't want to give up, pal... Phoenix: (I never thought... I didn't think it was possible... The person who put the spy camera in Juan Corrida's room was Matt Engarde!) Pearl: Why... Why would Mr. Engarde do something like this!? Gumshoe: I bet it was to catch Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida in one of their rendezvous. Phoenix: \"I bet\" is not good enough for me. I have to know the absolute truth behind this camera. Gumshoe: Are you going to see him? Mr. Engarde, I mean. Phoenix: Yes. Pearl: I'm... I'm scared, Mr. Nick. I wonder... I wonder what we will find out next... Phoenix: (I'm scared myself, but I have to put on a good face for Pearls... Matt Engarde! What in the world have you done!?) Corrida's Hotel Room Present Spy Camera or Transmitter Pearl: I've learned a lot of things during this case. For example, if you want to spy on someone, there are devices like this you can use. Phoenix: Well, it's not really a device for the purpose of spying. The way any device is used is decided by the people who use them. Pearl: ... Stuffed Bear Pearl: Poor teddy... I feel bad for it. Its eye was... It was... And all for the criminal's mean plan... Phoenix: (This bear... It's an expensive luxury brand from overseas.) But it's OK, Pearls. Now it's helping us by giving us a clue... It's telling us who the real culprit is so we can get some justice. Detention Center (after clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices) Engarde: You're working really late, you know. It's already past 10:00 PM, dude. Phoenix: I think it's time you told me the truth. Engarde: ... Relax. Don't you know that \"ignorance is bliss\"? But if you really want to know, let's talk. Talk Matt's secret (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Engarde: Well done, Mr. Wright. I bet it wasn't easy to gather as much information as you have. Phoenix: You really... So you were Shelly de Killer's client!? Engarde: You don't really think I would dirty my own hands in this, do you? Pearl: Wh-What do you mean!? Engarde: And that woman... Adrian was quite brave herself. Trying to stick the crime on me -- I didn't think she had it in her. But all I care about is that Juan is dead. Isn't that right, Mister Lawyer? Pearl: Th-That's... You're lying!! What a terrible...! Engarde: It's way past your bedtime... little girl. Go on, and let us grown-ups talk about more... adult things. Pearl: But why!? Why did you hide the video camera and... Engarde: ... A weakling soon believes the words of others... just like that pathetic Adrian. Phoenix: (He knew about Ms. Andrews' secret...?) Engarde: But I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all assassins. Phoenix: What...? Engarde: Oh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail. They turn their clients into cashcows by holding the sinful deed over their heads. And a superstar like me, how much do you think I'm worth? Care to guess? Pearl: And... And that's why...? Engarde: Yes, that's where the video comes in. It's got his face and the crime scene recorded on it, preserved for all time. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want. That's right. That video is my \"insurance\"... Isn't that what they call it, Mr. Wright? Pearl: Why would you do something so wrong...? Engarde: Because I'm a grown-up, and I can. Good enough of an answer for you, little girl? Motive for murder (appears after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: Why!? Why would you kill Mr. Corrida...? Engarde: Because he was about to sling so much dung onto my beautiful public image. Scandals are a little annoying, aren't they? Phoenix: This is all because of that press conference, isn't it...? Pearl: If Mr. Corrida had been able to give it, then Mr. Engarde's secret would've... Engarde: Ah, well, that's what we call \"taking advantage of the situation\", you know? I had no interest in doing it, really, but bit by bit, it crept up on me. And then the situation just presented itself perfectly... \"How beautiful,\" I thought. Pearl: And that's... That's how Mr. Corrida ended up dead... Engarde: Let me tell you something. I'm not like Adrian. I don't depend on anyone. People are simply things to be used. Used and thrown away. Put on a sweet, innocent face, and people will swallow anything you feed them. Adrian fell for it. The assassin too. Oh, and how can I forget. Even you fell for it, Mister Lawyer! Everyone, all working their butts off for me, Matt Engarde! Pearl: ... Engarde: Aww, did that leave you speechless? What a shame. Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Matt's Secret -- Phoenix: Now, let's hear what this \"secret\" of yours is. What if Mr. Corrida had been successful in his plan? What would he have disclosed...? Engarde: I told you before, dude. I don't know! I don't know anything about Juan, OK? Look, Mr. Wright. I can keep on saying it until I'm blue in the face, but... I totally didn't pay Juan any attention the whole time that night! I mean, come on! I was in the middle of a nap! Phoenix: Don't lie to me. Engarde: Huh? Phoenix: I know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night! Present Spy Camera or Transmitter Phoenix: Phoenix: Someone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder. Engarde: ...\"Secretly film\"...? What? Phoenix: And then sent the images the camera took with this transmitter. Engarde: Wow... But dude, where was this camera you're talking about hidden? Present Stuffed Bear Phoenix: Leads to: \"The spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: Mr. Lawyer dude, I'm really tired... Phoenix: I know... Engarde: But dude, you look even more tired than me. Why don't we call it quits for today and get some sleep? How does that sound? Phoenix: What made you say that all of a sudden? Engarde: Well, you're here showing me stuff that doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: Oh, oops. (I guess I really must be tired...) But I'm not giving up just yet. Leads back to: \"Someone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder.\" Phoenix: The spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye! Engarde: ... Phoenix: A bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan! 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"...Hmph.\" Present Stuffed Bear Phoenix: This bear was in Mr. Corrida's room on the night of the murder. A bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan! Engarde: So? It's a present, dude. It actually looks kinda classy, if you know what I mean. Phoenix: Yes, I hear it's quite expensive. Which is why it is very odd that this gadget was found inside this bear! Present Spy Camera or Transmitter Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is a very small video camera.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: Mr. Lawyer dude, I'm really tired... Phoenix: I know... Engarde: But dude, you look even more tired than me. Why don't we call it quits for today and get some sleep? How does that sound? Phoenix: What made you say that all of a sudden? Engarde: Well, you're here showing me stuff that doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: Oh, oops. (I guess I really must be tired...) But I'm not giving up just yet. Leads back to: \"This bear was in Mr. Corrida's room on the night of the murder.\" Phoenix: This is a very small video camera. And it was hidden inside this bear's eye. Engarde: ...Maybe it's a really curious bear...? Phoenix: Well, whatever this \"bear\" saw was sent somewhere using this transmitter. Which means... Someone, on the night of the murder, was secretly filming Mr. Corrida's room! 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"...Hmph.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult my friend, OK? ... ... He said I should snort while I give a good laugh. Phoenix: Um... Engarde: OK, here I go. ... Aha ha ha ha *snort!* Phoenix: (I can't believe he can be so flippant at a time like this...) Um, Mr. Engarde... I don't think you need to snort while you laugh. Really. Leads back to: \"I know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night!\" Engarde: ...Hmph. I guess Juan had a few of those kinds of fans too, huh dude? Phoenix: Actually, I wouldn't say this bear was a present from a \"fan\". Engarde: ... Hmm... You sure, dude? Who else could it be from? Phoenix: The person who gave this bear to Mr. Corrida was... Present Matt Engarde profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Engarde. Don't you know this bear from somewhere...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my mom, OK? ... ... She says that I can't be friends with someone like you. Phoenix: Um... Engarde: Go home! If you don't go away, I'm gonna call the police on you! Phoenix: (...That's strange. I thought the answer was right there in front of me...) Leads back to: \"Actually, I wouldn't say this bear was a present from a \"fan\".\" Phoenix: Mr. Engarde. Don't you know this bear from somewhere...? Engarde: I don't think I've ever met Mr. Bear before, dude. Phoenix: Aww, but he says he knows you. How could you forget such a great friend? Engarde: ... What else did the bear tell you? Phoenix: He says that the one who put the camera in his eye was you, Mr. Engarde. Engarde: ... If I didn't know how you work in court, I'd think I was in some serious trouble. Come on... This is all a joke, right dude? You're just pulling my leg. Phoenix: Looks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet. Engarde: Well, do you have any proof you want to show me first? Phoenix: Here is proof that it was you who put the camera inside the bear: Present Credit Card Receipt Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, come on, Mr. Engarde! Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my grandma, OK? ... ... Did you know? It's bad to whistle at night, dude... Because snakes will come out if you do. Phoenix: Um... Engarde: My grandma, she knows all sorts of stuff. I think you'd better learn from her example, OK? Phoenix: (Is he telling me to think carefully before I speak...? Argh! So close and yet so far!) Leads back to: \"Looks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet.\" Phoenix: I have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde. It's from when YOU bought that stuffed bear! Engarde: Dude, all you can tell from this is that I spent $3,800. I go to that department store all the time, OK? This $3,800... This could be the toothbrush I bought that one time. Phoenix: A-A THIRTY-EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR TOOTHBRUSH!? Engarde: ...It's ivory... And it's got elephant hair for bristles... Phoenix: (Eww... Elephant hair? Is that what rich people use nowadays...?) Anyway! The store clerk clearly remembers you and your purchase. After all, you even gave him an autograph, did you not!? Engarde: ... Dude... You should've said that earlier. 1 LOCK BROKEN Engarde: ... Um, so can I ask you one thing? Phoenix: Yes? Engarde: You're my lawyer, right dude? So, if you are, then why are you looking into stuff like that? Phoenix: Because if I don't know the truth, I can't help you. Engarde: Sounds more like stupid lawyer talk to me... Hey, let's stop talking about this, OK? Phoenix: No, not yet. I haven't asked why you set the camera up yet. Engarde: ... Phoenix: And what your \"secret\" is. Of course, it would be strictly confidential... Engarde: So...? What are you going to do now? Phoenix: I'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must. The reason you hid this camera in Mr. Corrida's room and filmed it in secret is... Present Picture Card Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wh-What is this card...?\" Present Magazine Clipping or Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Engarde: Adrian Andrews? Phoenix: There is a rumor going around... That Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida were having secret meetings. Engarde: ... Phoenix: You, who was keeping tabs on Mr. Corrida... You were going to reveal this as fact, and turn it into a scandal. Isn't that right!? Engarde: ... ...Dude, you can be such a moron. Phoenix: Huh? Engarde: Oh man, Mr. Lawyer dude, that kind of scandal... That's the good stuff! That's what we in the industry call \"juicy\"! Phoenix: ...The \"good stuff\"...? \"Juicy\"...? Engarde: Look, we can get publicity without spending a penny with that kind of stuff. I mean, if people stopped paying attention to us, then it'd be the end, dude. Phoenix: ... Too bad that wasn't your intention. Engarde: What are you talking about? Phoenix: I wish your reason for spying was something so innocent. But it wasn't. You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews... Then there's only one reason I can think of for you to do such a thing. Engarde: ...! Phoenix: The real reason you set up that camera in Mr. Corrida's room was... Present Picture Card Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wh-What is this card...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: ...If I really wanted to set up a spy camera... I wouldn't have set it up in Juan's room. It would be in your office, dude. Phoenix: Huh? My office...? Engarde: Well, dude, you're always saying really absurd things, right? It'd be like getting the comedy channel for free! Phoenix: (Argh! I'm so close! I can feel it!) I-If you're done laughing! Leads back to: \"You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: ... ... Phoenix: Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Dude, how about you take that bear home with you and talk to it? I'm sure Mr. Bear will talk with you about as much as I will, which is not at all. Phoenix: Um... (I have to somehow get it through his head I'm not giving up.) Engarde: So, is it time to throw in the towel yet, dude? Phoenix: Sorry, but no. Leads back to: \"I'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must.\" Engarde: Wh-What is this card...? Phoenix: (Maybe he doesn't know about this card...) This is a certain man's \"calling card\"... The man's name is Shelly de Killer... and I'm sure you know of him, don't you? Engarde: Shelly... de Killer... Th-Th-That's ridiculous! Wh-Why would I know some shady scumbag like him...? Phoenix: If you really don't know him, then why are you acting so jumpy all of a sudden? Engarde: Umm! Phoenix: (This is it! I'm finally starting to get to the truth! I can't afford to make any more mistakes now...) Mr. Matt Engarde. I know why you know Mr. de Killer. It's because... you're a hero of justice. Phoenix: It's because you're the great hero of justice, the Nickel Samurai! Engarde: Duuuuude!? Phoenix: You spied on that room to do one thing and one thing only! To expose Shelly de Killer's fiendish plot! Engarde: ...I... ...Okay... If that's what you think, then whatever, dude. Phoenix: ... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry. Slip of the tongue... Leads back to: \"Mr. Matt Engarde.\" you're his client. Leads to: \"Since you're the one who set up that camera...\" you're a star. Phoenix: It's because you're a star! Engarde: Duuuuude!? What in the world are you talking about!? Phoenix: Well, you're a star. And stars never need a logical, or sane reason for anything! Engarde: ...I... ...Okay... If that's what you think, then whatever, dude. Phoenix: ... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry. Slip of the tongue... Leads back to: \"Mr. Matt Engarde.\" Phoenix: Since you're the one who set up that camera... That means you knew... You knew exactly what was going to happen in that room! Engarde: ... Phoenix: So... How? How would you know something like that...? It's because you're his client. That's why. You hired Shelly de Killer to assassinate Mr. Juan Corrida! The real mastermind behind this whole murder is... You, Matt Engarde! Engarde: ... ... ... ...*sigh* And here I was, trying to be a good boy for you, dude. Phoenix: ...! Engarde: I thought if you didn't know, you'd be able to do your job without feeling bad. Well, that's what I thought, anyway... Phoenix: M-Mr. Engarde... You really did hire...!? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult myself, OK? ... ... Phoenix: (Consult... \"myself\"...??) Engarde: ...Well, I guess it's probably about time anyway. Phoenix: About time for what? Engarde: I think it's time for you to meet him now, Mr. Lawyer dude. 3 LOCKS BROKEN Engarde: How do you do... Mister Lawyer? I'm Matt Engarde. Unlock Successful Anything (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Engarde: I don't care what you show... I think you've gotten enough out of me, don't you? Enough freebies for today. The rest is up to you, isn't that right... Mister Lawyer? After breaking Matt Enguarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Engarde: What's wrong, Mister Lawyer? You've grown awfully quiet... Phoenix: H-How could I have been so deceived by you all this time? When we first met, I asked if you had killed Juan Corrida... And you answered very clearly that you hadn't killed anyone. Engarde: Hey now. I never told you any lies. The person who did the killing was that De Killer guy, right? All I'm guilty of is taking a catnap in my room. Phoenix: You... You... You killed Mr. Corrida! Engarde: Hahaha. I dare you to say that in court tomorrow. Phoenix: Grr... Engarde: Aww, but too bad. You can't. You're my lawyer, after all. Aren't you? Phoenix: ... Engarde: You could always drop my case and refuse to represent me. How does that sound? Aww, but you can't, can you? That would be the one thing you absolutely can't do. Pearl: M-Mystic Maya...! Engarde: You wouldn't want to test De Killer. He's a man of his word, or so I hear. You could end up getting a certain friend of yours rubbed out if you lose. Phoenix: ...Y...You... scoundrel... Engarde: So if I were you, Mr. Wright, esquire, I think I would give it my all tomorrow. Remember, everyone likes a happy win-win resolution. Phoenix: I... I'll get you for this! Engarde: That's such a clich\u00e9 phrase. Juan said something just like that, if memory serves. Of course... Well, we all know how well things turned out for him, don't we? Good night, Mister Lawyer. Phoenix: (Maya... Maya, what am I supposed to do!?) ???: ... And now... Now you've finally found it. Edgeworth: The starting line of this case. Phoenix: Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I don't care for the horrid atmosphere here. Let's return to the precinct. March 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Edgeworth: Well, Wright? What are you going to do? If you plan on changing your defense... Pearl: N...No! We can't do that... Edgeworth: That's right... He's holding Maya hostage... Phoenix: ... What... What should I do...? Edgeworth: ... That's not something I can answer for you. Pearl: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Wright... Only you can decide where to go from here. One year ago... At that time, I didn't truly understand what a \"prosecutor\" was. And that is why... I had to leave the Prosecutor's Office. I felt that I couldn't stand in a court of law until I knew what a prosecutor really was. And now, Wright... It's your turn. Phoenix: My... turn? Edgeworth: What is this thing called a \"lawyer\"? What can you do as one? You must find the answer... And you must find it on your own. Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: I'm a lawyer... But to fight for someone who is clearly a killer... Matt Engarde... That man is really... Argh! Edgeworth: It doesn't matter who, every person deserves a proper defense and a fair trial. Isn't that the basis of our judicial system? Phoenix: \"Proper defense\"? But what exactly is that? Is it where a lawyer forcibly and blindly gets an acquittal through shouting and trickery? Edgeworth: ...*sigh* Ironic that you of all people should say such a thing. Isn't that exactly how you have fought for your clients up until now? Phoenix: Uh... W-Well, that may be true, but... But that's... That's because I've believed my clients to be innocent from the bottom of my heart! But if I were to get Engarde an acquittal... That... That isn't a proper defense at all! Maya's situation Phoenix: I became a lawyer because I thought... I thought I could save people who were suffering and in pain... Pearl: ... Phoenix: But... When I look at this mess we're in... I can't even protect the person closest to me. Even if I win the case, I still lose in the end... I just don't know what to do! Edgeworth: ... Wright. Would you get a hold of yourself? You have it all wrong. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: We aren't some sort of heroes. We're only human, you and I. You want to \"save someone\"? That's something easier said than done, wouldn't you say? Pearl: Th-That's... Edgeworth: You are a defense lawyer. You can't run away from that. You can only fight. That's all you can do. Why fight? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Maya's situation\") Leads to: \"People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down.\" Present Anything Phoenix: (Now's not the time to talk about evidence...) Phoenix: People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down. You fight to the very end, even when you know the truth is not with you. But I'm not like you. I can't fight for a false verdict -- for a man I clearly know to be guilty! Edgeworth: ... Franziska... She fights for herself. The only thing she fights for is her perfect win record. That's all. Phoenix: And!? Isn't that the same as you!? Isn't that why you ran away a year ago? Because your precious win record was destroyed!? You are so petty! Edgeworth: ... I see... Now I understand why you despise me so. However, you are mistaken. Phoenix: What do you...? Edgeworth: Thanks to you, when you sealed off my path to a perfect win record... I began to realize the error of my ways. I realized that things such as a perfect record were meaningless. Pearl: What!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release) Phoenix: I don't believe you. Are you saying that is why you left the Prosecutor's Office? But then, why? Why are you here now? Edgeworth: The answer to that... is something you will find out on your own. I have faith you will see it before the verdict is read tomorrow. But if you can't, then you will be powerless to change the ending of this story. ...*beep beep beep*... Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! The transceiver! ...*beep*... ???: I'm sorry for what happened earlier. Well then, Mr. Attorney. Do you wager you can obtain an acquittal tomorrow? Phoenix: ... ???: My, my. What is the matter, Mr. Attorney? I don't sense your usual anger this time. Phoenix: ...Tell me. Please. Why are you holding Maya hostage for Mr. Engarde's sake? Why are you... Why are you doing this for that cold-blooded killer!? Edgeworth: Wright... ???: ... Please don't misunderstand things. He is my client. Phoenix: Don't toy with me! A man who hires an assassin is just as much of a killer himself! ???: ... ...I believe you were asking me for a reason as to why I am doing what I am... Phoenix: ...Y-Yeah. ???: This is what I like to call my \"aftercare\". Phoenix: Wh-What the heck is \"aftercare\"? ???: My name carries a certain amount of honor and dignity, Mr. Attorney. I take great care to insure that no suspicion falls upon my clients for my handiwork. That is what is called \"client relations\" and it is a part of an assassin's duty. Phoenix: An assassin's... \"duty\"...? ???: We were unlucky this time and my client was arrested as a suspect. As a result, I did what I had to do to enlist your expert help, Mr. Attorney. And to ensure that you would do everything in your power to the very end. Phoenix: Wh-What is your name!? ???: I believe I told you once before, however... Phoenix: You did... But... ???: My name is... De Killer. Shelly de Killer. Edgeworth: Y-You're Shelly de Killer!? de Killer: Please keep in mind you do not have much space to maneuver with me. As a De Killer, I always finish what I set out to do. If you fail to keep up your end of the bargain... Phoenix: M-Maya! de Killer: It would be my duty as an assassin to see to it she receives a nice long nap. Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaaah! Noooooooooooo! de Killer: Now then, if you'll excuse me. If someone were to trace this signal back to me, it would be quite troublesome. ...Meow. ...*beep*... Pearl: Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaa! Edgeworth: I... I don't know what to say... Phoenix: ...Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hm? Phoenix: Did you hear that? At the end of that transmission... ...Meow. Edgeworth: Huh? Oh, that... It sounded like a cat. Pearl: ...A cat? Phoenix: (It can't be... that cat... Can it...?) Pearl: What is it...? Phoenix: I think... I know where Shelly de Killer is holding Maya hostage! Edgeworth! Have all police units head for Engarde Mansion immediately! Edgeworth: ...! Alright. You hurry over as well, then! Phoenix: Don't lose hope yet, Pearls! The fight has only just begun! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Detention Center (after breaking Matt Engarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: (Now then, whose story do I want to hear?) Matt Engarde Jailer: I'm really sorry, but... Matt Engarde is refusing to meet with you. Phoenix: ...I see. Phoenix: (Well, I guess I don't really have anything left to talk to him about anyway...) Pearl: Shall we listen to what Ms. Andrews has to say...? March 22Engarde MansionLiving Room Phoenix: Maya! Pearl: Please answer us! Mystic Mayaaaa! Edgeworth: We have this area completely surrounded. There is no way for him to escape. Assuming he's still in the area... Phoenix: I can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer... Edgeworth: He and Engarde were working together all this time. I'm sure they had worked out a contingency plan ahead of time. Examine Fireplace Phoenix: This is the first time I've seen such a large fireplace. Edgeworth: I don't particularly care for large fireplaces. They remind me of my youth. Phoenix: (I wonder, if memory serves, if it's because of that rich aunt he had?) Don't tell me you're still stuck on that incident...? Edgeworth: Don't take this personally, but I really do not wish to remember anything from that time in my life. Motorcycle Edgeworth: It seems that Engarde was quite famous, even as a motorcycle racer. Phoenix: Generally when a star like him tries to do something like that, they fail, but... Edgeworth: It seems Engarde is no ordinary man. Lounge set Edgeworth: That Engarde... This is probably where he conducted business with De Killer. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: Shelly de Killer values his client relations more than anything else. So I'm sure he must meet with his clients in person to talk about any transactions. Masks Edgeworth: It's Engarde's personal collection. I'd say it's a hobby of his to collect prop masks of shows related to his own. Phoenix: You seem to know all sorts of details about Matt Engarde... Almost too many details... Edgeworth: He's the defendant in this case. Of course I would know about him. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... I guess that makes sense... Doorway behind railing Phoenix: It looks like there's another room in the back. Edgeworth: Leave that to us. I'm sure the investigation team is already doing its job in there. Door Pearl: There's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: I bet it's for the cat to use. Pearl: Oh, you mean Shoe. Bear figurine Leads to: \"Oh, it's a figurine of a bear!\" Pearl: Oh, it's a figurine of a bear! But there are a lot of cuts in it for some reason... Figurine added to the Court Record. Phoenix: A bear...? Isn't that more of a thing for Mr. Corrida? Why would something like this be here...? Edgeworth: Wright, look down. There's a little pet door installed here. Pearl: Ah, I'm sure that's for Shoe... Phoenix: Do you think that this... came through that little door...? Edgeworth: Umph! This door... It's locked! Phoenix: Well, I'm pretty used to breaking doors down by now. Let's go, Edgeworth! *SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!* Private Lounge Phoenix: Argh! There's no one here! Edgeworth: From the looks of this room, I would say this is Engarde's private lounge. ...Look at this, Wright! Phoenix: An antennae for sending and receiving radio signals and a VCR... Check inside the deck! If there's a tape, it would be an important piece of evidence! (If we're lucky, it'll have the moment the crime was committed recorded on it!) Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but... The tape deck is empty. There's no tape to be found. Pearl: No... Edgeworth: But there's no mistake that someone used this to record something. It looks like someone took the tape we're looking for, and escaped with it... Examine TV Phoenix: A huge television and speakers loom largely here. I'm sure if Maya saw this, she'd say, Maya: \"I would die a happy Samurai fan if I could see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this!\" Phoenix: Yeah, that's what she'd say... ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about Maya, all things considered... Satellite dish Phoenix: It's a VCR and an antennae. The footage that the spy camera took at the scene of the crime... was beamed here and recorded on tape. Pearl: If only we had that tape, it would have been really helpful... Computer Phoenix: It's Engarde's computer. Maya... Why couldn't you have used this to get help? Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! Where's... Where's the power switch!? Phoenix: ... (Oh, I get it... So that's what happened. She couldn't find the power switch...) Table Phoenix: It's a very small table. I bet we could barely squeeze 3 Pearls on there. Pearl: But I wouldn't sit on a table to begin with, Mr. Nick... Sofa Phoenix: What a spacious sofa. I bet 10 Pearls would fit on here. Pearl: Um, I don't think 10 of me would fit, Mr. Nick... Video tapes Phoenix: I can't read all the labels, but this is a very large collection of video tapes. Looks like Engarde taped all of his own shows... Door Pearl: There's a little door for Shoe in this big door. Phoenix: I'm sure Maya used this door to shove this out there... I'm sure it was her! (Every time you give me some piece of evidence, it's always the most crucial piece. This time too, I'm sure...) Wine Cellar Phoenix: ... (We've searched all over, but it looks like he got away...) Edgeworth: I'm sorry. It looks like he slipped out of our grasp this time. Phoenix: And now... we've lost our only lead. Edgeworth: Don't give up yet. That little girl is looking to you to be her pillar. Pearl: ... Phoenix: ...Yeah, you're right. Edgeworth: We're close, I can tell. We've already set up checkpoints along every route leading out of this district. Leave the rest to us. Phoenix: (Maya...) Examine Bottles Pearl: Wow... I've never seen so many bottles all in one place before. Phoenix: Well, I guess when you're a star, you have so much money you can buy anything you want. Boxes Phoenix: The light doesn't filter in all the way, so it's hard to see. It looks like there are crates and cardboard boxes tied up with wire here. Door Pearl: It's a pretty heavy door, isn't it? I can't open it by myself. Please don't shut me in here by accident, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (If I were locked in a place like this... I'd be plenty scared too. Trust me.) Photo frame Leads to: \"This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax...\" Phoenix: This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax... (\"With love... Celeste\") Pearl: Ms. Inpax? You mean...? Phoenix: Yes, Mr. Corrida's former manager. Pearl: Why would a picture of Ms. Inpax be here in Mr. Engarde's mansion? Phoenix: (And why does it say, \"With love\"...? Hmm, this might be a clue...) Celeste's Photo added to the Court Record. Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: What's wrong, Pearls? Pearl: P-Please let me see that picture frame! Phoenix: (Huh? What's so special about the frame?) Pearl: On the back... There's something written on the back of the frame! ...\"Maya\" It's Mystic Maya! She left us a message! Phoenix: Wh-What!? Maya: I thought you'd come. I knew you would. Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever! I'm fine, so you don't need to worry. ...There's so much I want to write, but I don't think I have a lot of time left. Pearly, you're there too, right? Make sure you help Nick, OK? Someone's gotta watch out for the helpless lunk. ... Um... That's it for now, Nick. I guess I'll talk to you guys later. Pearl: ...That's... I... Nooooooooo! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa... *sob* Edgeworth: Wright! Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: What's wrong? Why the blank stare? Phoenix: Oh, um, nothing. Edgeworth: We've searched the house, and this is the last room. It looks like he eluded us. Phoenix: ...Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Yes? Phoenix: As far as clues go, I think this is about all I'm going to get. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: But I'm still short one last thing... Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews' Psyche-Lock... If I could just find out what secret she's holding... Then I think I stand a chance in court tomorrow... To blow this case wide open and expose the truth.) Edgeworth: I think I know what you're thinking. I'll contact the detention center. Phoenix: Um... Thanks, Edgeworth. Well, let's go Pearls. It's time to open that last lock. March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Andrews: Good evening, Mr. Wright. ... What's wrong? You look ill... Phoenix: Ms. Andrews. I have come to remove your Psyche-Lock. Andrews: Psyche-Lock...? Phoenix: I want to know, and you will tell me... ...your secret. Andrews: Fine, go ahead. Try to break me, if you can. Talk Why frame him? (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Andrews: Celeste... She was supposed to get married to Juan. Phoenix: Yes... But I heard that it didn't work out. Pearl: Because Mr. Corrida didn't want to get married to her anymore, right...? Andrews: Yes... Because of Matt. Pearl: B-Because of Mr. Engarde? What do you mean? Phoenix: (I think I can see where this is going.) Andrews: Celeste... She was Matt's manager a long time ago. She was the happiest woman in the world at that time. I was working part-time back then, and I often saw the two of them together. Phoenix: So that's why... \"With love... Celeste\" is written on the frame of that picture. Pearl: They were a couple, weren't they? Andrews: It wasn't anything as splendid as that. Celeste was being used; toyed with until she was... thrown away. Pearl: That's so horrible... Andrews: Matt's entire image is built around how nice and wonderful of a man he is. A scandal would have destroyed that. Which is why Celeste, in her kindness, moved over to Worldwide Studios. And that is where she met Juan. She seemed really happy with him; even happier than when she was with Matt. Celeste and Juan were such a good match that they were even planning to get married. And then it was suddenly called off. On the night Juan called their marriage off, Celeste... She killed herself. And that's why I framed Matt. It was revenge for Celeste and for myself. Revenge (appears after \"Why frame him?\") Leads to: \"I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right?\" Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- Why Frame Him? -- Phoenix: Can you please tell me why you framed Mr. Engarde for the murder? Andrews: I've already told you countless times. It's because I thought Matt was the killer. Phoenix: (No, that's not it! I know you have a personal reason to dislike Mr. Engarde.) Ms. Andrews. You may think I didn't hear it, but I know you said something earlier. You said, \"Revenge.\" Andrews: So you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why? Wh-What an absurd idea. I... I don't have anything I want to take revenge for. Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews... A woman who lives by being dependent on other people...) (Changed from [Ms. Andrews... A woman who lives by being dependant [sic] on another person...] in the original release) (There is something or someone in her past that would make her take revenge...) Present Suicide Report or Celeste Inpax profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"C-Celeste...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: Are you trying to help or hurt Matt with what you're doing...? Phoenix: What? What am I doing? Andrews: This random, haphazard throwing out of evidence you're so fond of doing. Phoenix: Th-That's not what I was trying to do at all! Andrews: Then refrain from doing it anymore. Phoenix: (I guess I screwed up big again...) Leads back to: \"So you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why?\" Andrews: C-Celeste... Phoenix: There is only one catalyst that could cause such strong feelings, and even revenge. And that is Ms. Inpax's suicide. Andrews: Wh-What are you trying to say? Celeste was Juan's manager. Phoenix: ... Andrews: On top of that, the one who hid her suicide note was also Juan. What does all this have to do with Matt? Phoenix: You're right. You haven't mentioned him... Yet. But for you to hate Mr. Engarde... It would mean that he must have had some relation to Ms. Inpax and her suicide. Andrews: Can you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!? Present Celeste's Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: That's it? Phoenix: Yes... Andrews: And what sort of relation is this supposed to explain? Phoenix: W-Well, Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde's... Andrews: Before you start, Mr. Wright, perhaps I should first request to see proof that your brain is wired correctly. Phoenix: (Argh. I can't afford to mess up something as big as this! I need evidence that clearly shows a connection between Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde. If I can find that, I can finally get the real story!) Andrews: I wonder if you'd like to try again, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"Can you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!?\" Phoenix: This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct? She looks younger than when she passed away though. Andrews: ...W... Phoenix: \"With love... Celeste\". This is Ms. Inpax's handwriting, isn't it? Andrews: ... Where did you find this...? No, that's alright. It was a rhetorical question... Phoenix: Yeah, it is. I found this at Mr. Engarde's mansion. Andrews: ... ...And after all this time... My last remaining secret has been revealed... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Andrews: I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right? Matt \"confessed\" to Juan... about his relationship with Celeste. Phoenix: I see... So that's what happened. Pearl: But... Then why did Mr. Corrida have to call off the wedding!? I don't understand at all... Andrews: It was probably because of his worthless male pride. Juan and Matt were always fierce rivals. Matt waited for the wedding announcement and then unleashed the truth on Juan. He was aiming for when it would hurt Juan the most. Pearl: Poor Ms. Inpax! Andrews: ...That wasn't the end of it. That day, I'm almost certain that Celeste left a suicide note behind. And in that note, she left a detailed account of Matt's various misdeeds, and... So that she would never again be hurt by Matt, she chose... to die. Then, when Juan discovered her body, he hid her note. Pearl: B-But why would he do that!? Andrews: It's simple. Juan realized that note was a powerful weapon against Matt. And it would be especially damaging to his \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image. In any case... With his pride hurt, Juan sought revenge. Phoenix: Revenge... There's that word again. Andrews: Juan wanted to publicly disclose the contents of that suicide note. At a time that would cause Matt the most damage, of course. Phoenix: And that was at the press conference after the stage show... Andrews: I know all about it, because I heard it all from Juan. It was so I could find out about all this that I drew close to Juan to begin with. They're quite a pair of hideous monsters, aren't they? Even Celeste's death was something for them to use in their game. That night, when I found Juan's body, it was only natural that I thought the murderer was Matt. Those two were always spying on one another, after all. As for me, I was frantically searching for Celeste's suicide note. I wanted to destroy it before it ever went public. I was going to burn it. I had even brought a lighter. But... I couldn't find the suicide note... And that's when revenge crossed my mind. Yes, I was going to bring to them my own kind of cruel revenge. Celeste was killed by those two monsters. So when I stabbed Juan's body with that knife... I didn't feel a single shred of guilt. Pearl: ...! Andrews: ... And that's all I have to say. Phoenix: ... Andrews: Well, Mr. Wright? Even knowing all this, are you still going to help that... \"man\"? Phoenix: ... I... I'm a lawyer... Andrews: I see. What a foul profession. Phoenix: ... Thank you very much for your time and for talking with me. Andrews: It was no big deal. I couldn't sleep anyway. Phoenix: (I can't sleep either... Not with Maya's situation... or with what I know now...) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Maya Fey) Maya: I can't see very well in this darkness, but it doesn't seem like there's anything there... Nothing to examine during bug sweeping session Pearl: There doesn't seem to be anything giving off radio waves there, Mr. Nick. Keep a careful eye on the bug sweeper and let's try again! (Changed from [Keep a careful eye on the CHECK gauge, and let's try again!] in the original release) Phoenix: (This sweeper isn't exactly the best... Well, make do with what you have, right?) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- Visit to Matt's Room --Powers: After the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant's room? Why did you go there? Powers: Well, I'm his mentor, like a big brother sort of, and I wanted to say congrats... ... ... Judge: Wh-What's wrong? Why did you stop? Powers: M-M-Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What is it? Powers: You... You're going to try to trick me into a corner, aren't you? Phoenix: Huh? Powers: I... I know I'm just a poor, underpaid action star, but... But... I... I'm not the killer! Phoenix: Um, no one said you were, Mr. Powers. Powers: No, please! Don't trick me! Every time you do your lawyer thing, the witness suddenly turns into the bad guy... Phoenix: (\"Every time\"...?) Edgeworth: ...Witness. I will personally talk to the defense at a later time. So for now, please kindly cooperate and continue with your testimony. Powers: S-Sorry... Judge: So, you went to the defendant's room. And then? Phoenix: (Hey, wait a minute! When and how did I suddenly turn into the bad guy here??)Powers: Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure that was Matt Engarde? Powers: Yeah, I'm sure. He wasn't wearing the Nickel Samurai mask then. Phoenix: (If that's the case, then he really can't be mistaken...) Edgeworth: And? What was the defendant doing, standing in front of his own room?Powers: He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"At first\"? What do you mean by that? Powers: Well, he was in a bellboy-ish uniform and he had a bottle of juice on a tray. Phoenix: ...Sounds like an ordinary bellboy to me. Powers: Um, yeah, but... I didn't think he was a normal bellboy. Phoenix: And why was that? Powers: Um... Why did I think that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: H-How am I supposed to know!? Powers: Sorry, but I can't remember right now. ...Sorry. Phoenix: (I guess I'm going to have to wait patiently on this one...)Press (after pressing fourth statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: \"At first\"? What do you mean by that? Powers: I didn't think he was a normal bellboy. Phoenix: And why was that? Powers: Um... Why did I think that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: H-How am I supposed to know!? (...Hey, wait a second...) Actually, Mr. Powers, only a few minutes ago, you stated: Powers: Um... You know, I did feel something weird. I think it was because Matt... Well, he gave the bellboy a tip. Phoenix: Could it be that you felt something \"strange\" about the tip-giving incident itself...? Powers: ... AH! Yeah! That's it! You really know your job! Judge: Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: This bellboy... He wasn't an ordinary one, was he...? Edgeworth: Perhaps we should let the witness tell us. Judge: Very well. Mr. Powers. Please amend your testimony. Powers: You mean about the bellboy, right? Changes statement from \"He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.\" to \"Matt gave the bellboy a tip.\"Powers: Matt gave the bellboy a tip.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So he gave the bellboy a tip. What's so strange about that? Powers: Ah, well, you see, Matt's not a poor penny-pincher like me. I was trying to figure out how much it was because the tip really shocked me. Phoenix: \"How much it was\"...? Powers: But that's when something even more surprising happened! The bellboy was putting the tip he got in his pocket. And that's when I got my first good look at the guy's face... I was really shocked! Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I don't follow at all. Phoenix: (It sounds like Mr. Powers was surprised twice by this event. I wonder which of his shocking moments I should ask about...?) The bellboy's face Phoenix: What was so shocking about the bellboy's face, Mr. Powers? Powers: Well, he wasn't exactly a \"boy\"... more like an old \"gramps\"... Judge: Ahem! I hope you know that discrimination towards old men is a no-no in my court! Powers: No, no, that's not what I meant at all! In the smack middle of the guy's face, there was a line of stitches! Judge: A line of stitches...? Powers: Yeah! And it went straight from the tippy top of his head to the bottom of his chin! Almost like if that thread snapped, all the stuff in his head would come spilling out. Phoenix: ... Ah! (He was there... At Engarde's house... He was that BUTLER!) Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: A-Ah, nothing, Your Honor! (So that means Engarde was talking with De Killer then. If that fact were to be exposed, Engarde would be declared guilty in a blink!) Mia: Phoenix, you have to play dumb here! Pretend you don't know anything! Phoenix: Yes, Chief! Judge: You sure you don't have something you would like to say, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Umm... What did you just say, Your Honor? Judge: ... Nothing, Mr. Wright. Nothing. We're just going around and around in circles. Now then, Mr. Powers. Please continue with your testimony. Edgeworth: ... Leads back to cross-examination Engarde's tip Leads to: \"The defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?\"Powers: I watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw the two of them, the bellboy and the defendant, together, correct? Powers: Yeah. The bellboy just wanted to say congrats. Phoenix: Now, while you were watching the two of them, did you notice anything strange? Powers: Um... You know, I did feel something weird. I think it was because Matt... Well, he gave the bellboy a tip. Phoenix: A tip? (But that's a perfectly normal thing to do...) Judge: So, how long did you watch the two of them? Powers: Ah, not more than a minute or two, I think.Powers: I had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So who are these \"guests\" you're talking about? Powers: You guys, of course. You and Maya and little Pearl. I thought it would be really rude since I invited you guys, if I disappeared on you... So I went back to my seat pretty soon after seeing Matt in the hallway. Phoenix: (This is like squeezing water from a stone... It's probably pointless to press further...)Mia: Do you remember this incident? Did Mr. Powers leave his seat that night?Phoenix: I don't remember that happening at all. Maya was making such a racket in her hyper state... I ended up focusing on her.Mia: ...I see. In any case, from his story, he probably wasn't gone for very long.Phoenix: The defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?Powers: Um, sure. But giving him that much was maybe a little too much, I think...Phoenix: (\"A little too much\"...?)Edgeworth: Would you please clarify for the court, about how much would you say the defendant gave to the bellboy?Powers: Honestly, I don't know. I can't even begin to guess.Judge: And why is that?Powers: Because he gave the bellboy a really, really fat roll of cash.Phoenix: A ROLL OF CASH!?Judge: Ah, well... How interesting... That certainly was a very generous tip, wasn't it?Edgeworth: A very fat roll of cash... That can hardly be called a \"tip\", Your Honor!Judge: Hmm...Phoenix: (The judge is beginning to look awfully suspicious of us...)Raise an objection Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant is a superstar! That kind of tip is typical fare for people like him! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you saying that all superstars are super-spenders!? If I could receive large rolls of cash by simply bringing people things on trays... Then why on Earth would I stand around here prosecuting!? Phoenix: (He's got a point... I don't even get paid, let alone rolls of cash for all my hard work.) Leads to: \"Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip...\"Wait and see Phoenix: (There's nothing I can really object to here. I mean, who can argue that a fat roll of money isn't really odd...?) Leads to: \"Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip...\"Judge: Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip... Then what was it?Edgeworth: Payment, Your Honor.Phoenix: ...!Judge: Payment...?Edgeworth: Isn't it obvious? For the murder of Mr. Juan Corrida.Judge: Then... Then the bellboy the witness saw...Edgeworth: Yes, he was the assassin.Judge: H-Hold your horses now! Mr. Edgeworth, you don't have any proof of this... do you?Edgeworth: Have I ever been unprepared to support my claims, Your Honor? I have here, the card Shelly de Killer left at the scene of the crime.Judge: Shelly... de Killer...Edgeworth: He is the person the police's special investigations team has been chasing for ages. I am certain that the person the witness saw was this very assassin, Shelly de Killer!Powers: R-Really!?Judge: ...? What's wrong, Mr. Powers?Powers: No, nothing. Something just clicked in my head and I think I just figured something out!Judge: Oh?Powers: Actually, I saw that bellboy again later on that night!Phoenix: WHAAAT!?Judge: Mr. Powers! Please testify! Tell us what you saw!Powers: Yes, sir! Right away!Witness Testimony-- The Second Time --Powers: This time, I was in that hallway because I had to go to the bathroom! And that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room! Of course, when I say \"room\", I mean Juan Corrida's room! Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place! Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it! I mean...Edgeworth: Thank you very much. That is all we need for now.Powers: Huh? But I'm not done. There's still more...Edgeworth: Let us first establish that the bellboy was truly Mr. de Killer. Then we shall see.Judge: Hmm... So the bellboy came out of the victim's room... And if that bellboy really was the assassin... Then, I think the answer is fairly obvious.Edgeworth: That would be correct, Your Honor. Well, Mr. Wright. I believe it's your turn... to entertain and make us laugh.Phoenix: Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.Mia: This is no laughing matter!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Second Time --Powers: This time, I was in that hallway because I had to go to the bathroom!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And what time was it? Powers: Ah, well, I don't remember. The award ceremony ended around 8 PM, right? ...And I went to Matt's room pretty soon after that... And then I came back... And then I went to the bathroom... ... So I guess maybe it was around 8:10 PM by that time? Judge: You're not one for details, are you Mr. Powers? Powers: S-Sorry... I thought I could maybe catch Matt and say my congrats...Powers: And that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was the same bellboy? Powers: Yeah. Phoenix: And how could you tell? All the bellboys wear the same uniform, after all! Powers: But, you see... Well, he had those stitches in his face. Phoenix: Urk. Powers: So I'm sure it's the same guy that was talking with Matt. Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: So which room did the bellboy come out of?Powers: Of course, when I say \"room\", I mean Juan Corrida's room!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The victim's room, huh...? Powers: Yeah. The one with all the really pretty flowers and teddy bears. It was Juan's room alright! Phoenix: (Words cannot describe how screwed I am...) Edgeworth: Hmph. Let's continue with the testimony, shall we?Powers: Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Um... so what exactly was so \"out of place\" about him? Edgeworth: Wright, Wright, Wright. Why the insipid grin? Phoenix: (Maybe because I have no idea what damaging thing he's going to say next...?) Powers: Um, well, the bellboy was empty-handed. Phoenix: Empty-handed? Powers: That bellboy was one of those room-service people, right? But he wasn't pushing a cart and he wasn't holding a tray either! You'd call that \"a little strange\" too, wouldn't you? Judge: Hmm... I agree that it is a bit strange, Mr. Powers. Phoenix: (But is it really that unusual for a bellboy to be empty-handed? What should I do? Should I let Mr. Powers' testimony slide or...?) Let it slide. Phoenix: You're right. I think it's pretty unusual too. Powers: Ah, I thought you might think so! Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Hmph. There's no need to say anything when the defense gives up without a fight. Let's move on. Judge: Anyway, Mr. Powers. You thought the bellboy was a little suspicious, correct? Leads back to cross-examination Try to pull a fast one. Phoenix: There is nothing strange or unusual about an empty-handed bellboy! Powers: But there really, really is! Phoenix: There really, really isn't! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you two are done being schoolchildren... Bellboys are for room service. There is no reason for them to be empty-handed, ever. Your Honor! I ask that the witness' previous statement be supplanted with this new one. Phoenix: (Grr... Edgeworth... Are you going to do whatever you can to make the bellboy look suspicious?) Judge: I see. Very well, this court recognizes and grants the prosecution's request. Mr. Powers, if you could amend your testimony, please. Powers: Y-Yes, sir. Changes statement from \"Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!\" to \"I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!\"Powers: I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're saying that it's suspicious for him to be empty-handed? Powers: Yeah, really suspicious. I mean, when I first saw that bellboy, he was holding a tray in his hand! And there was a bottle of juice and a wine glass on it! Phoenix: Juice...? What kind of juice was it? Powers: Um, I'm pretty sure it was tomato juice... Mia: If we could come up with some sort of reason as to why he would come out empty-handed, some sort of proof, then I think we can dodge the bullet on this one for now. Phoenix: Proof, huh? (Sounds like another job for the Court Record!)Present Wine Glass or Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Powers.\"Powers: Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Please don't be so quick to judge! Powers: Ah, but it's kind of a Powers family thing. \"Think of every person as a thief\". Phoenix: (Well, I guess a thief and an assassin are both sneaky and silent...) Mia: That's not the point, Phoenix.Mia: In any case, if that bellboy was the assassin, it would be very bad for us.Phoenix: But... he really is the assassin, you know?Mia: Yes... But. You can't give in yet. If you want to prolong this trial for as long as possible, you're going to have to pull some cheap tricks on this one.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Pearl Fey\nDescription: Maya's cousin.

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given scenario. The testimonies are from Will Powers about seeing a bellboy leaving Juan Corrida's room.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Powers mentions that the bellboy came out of the victim's room empty-handed, which he found suspicious because bellboys usually carry trays. The key here is that the bellboy (Shelly de Killer in disguise) was supposed to be delivering something but had nothing in his hands. \n\nNow, looking at the evidence, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) is present in the crime scene photo (Evidence 9). The Wine Glass has Adrian Andrews' fingerprints, but according to Powers' testimony, the bellboy (De Killer) should have delivered it. However, the Wine Glass was already in the room when Andrews arrived, implying that the bellboy didn't bring it, which contradicts the idea that he was there for room service. \n\nWait, but in the testimony, Powers says the bellboy had a tray with tomato juice when he first saw him with Matt Engarde. Later, when he saw the bellboy leaving Corrida's room, he was empty-handed. The Wine Glass in the room was already there, so if the bellboy was delivering it, he should have had it when leaving. But the Wine Glass in the room has Andrews' fingerprints, not the bellboy's. This suggests that the bellboy wasn't delivering the glass, contradicting his role as a room service person. Therefore, the empty-handed exit contradicts the presence of the Wine Glass, which was already there with Andrews' prints. \n\nSo the testimony about the bellboy being empty-handed (Testimony 4) contradicts the existence of the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) with Andrews' fingerprints, showing that the bellboy wasn't delivering it. But wait, the testimony about being empty-handed is in Testimony 4, which is \"I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!\" The Wine Glass (8) is already in the room, so the bellboy didn't bring it. Hence, the empty-handed testimony contradicts the presence of the Wine Glass, implying that the bellboy wasn't there for room service, thus being the assassin. \n\nBut the correct contradiction is between the testimony of the bellboy being empty-handed (Testimony 4) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) showing the Wine Glass present. The bellboy couldn't have delivered it if he left empty-handed. Therefore, the evidence should be the Crime Photo (9) which shows the Wine Glass already there, contradicting the bellboy's empty-handed exit. But the user might expect the Wine Glass (8) itself as the evidence. Alternatively, the Wine Glass's presence in the room (Evidence 8) contradicts the testimony that the bellboy left empty-handed. \n\nWait, the Wine Glass in the Crime Photo (9) is already in the room, so if the bellboy left empty-handed, he couldn't have placed it there. Hence, the testimony (Testimony 4) that he left empty-handed contradicts the presence of the Wine Glass (8 or 9). The correct pair would be Testimony 4 (empty-handed) and Evidence 8 (Wine Glass with Andrews' prints), showing that the bellboy didn't deliver it, so he wasn't a real bellboy. Alternatively, the Crime Photo (9) shows the glass, which the bellboy didn't bring. \n\nIn the game, presenting the Wine Glass during this testimony would expose that the bellboy couldn't have delivered it since Andrews' prints are on it, meaning she poured it herself, so the bellboy wasn't there for room service. Hence, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (empty-handed) and the Wine Glass (Evidence 8), showing that the bellboy didn't bring it, thus proving he was the assassin."

This wine glass.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I think it's time for you to go home now, Wright... Before you hurt yourself, that is. Phoenix: (Hurt myself...!?) Judge: It's alright, Mr. Wright. You don't have to push yourself so hard. Phoenix: (I guess I was trying a little too hard there...) Edgeworth: Now, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Mia: Come on, Phoenix. We can't afford to let up on her now. Phoenix: I wasn't planning on letting up, but... Mia: She's at her weakest now, so this is our chance! Phoenix: (Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...) Mia: I'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found. Phoenix: I have your proof right here. This wine glass. Andrews: The wine glass? Phoenix: You left your fingerprints very clearly on this wine glass. Andrews: Ah... Phoenix: Even if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!? Andrews: Ugn! Judge: Order! Order! Order!! Mia: Looks like you hit the nail on the head this time. Phoenix: ...? What do you mean? Mia: I believe that guitar case plays a very important role here. Phoenix: But it's just an empty case... Mia: I wonder if it really was empty though... Phoenix: B-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio! Mia: Phoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar. Phoenix: (You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...) Judge: Hmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided... Phoenix: Phoenix: No, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder! Phoenix: Uh... Judge: Can you do that, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Um, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case... Judge: The bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!? Phoenix: I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove! Edgeworth: Deflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!? Present The Nickel Samurai or Lotta's Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Th-This is... This is a photograph...!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: And why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one? Judge: Why, Mr. Wright, why? Phoenix: Well... I just thought it might have been possible...? Edgeworth: I have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be! Judge: Yes, and never bring it out again! Phoenix: (Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?) Edgeworth: Do you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder? Leads back to: \"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\" Judge: Th-This is... This is a photograph...! Phoenix: Yes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor. Judge: I-In this picture...? Phoenix: It doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume! Edgeworth: Wh-What!? Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself! Edgeworth: Wright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!? Phoenix: That insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews? Andrews: ...! Edgeworth: I-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!? Phoenix: Just outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct? Judge: You... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...? Mia: Nice job, Phoenix. Phoenix: Well, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later! Judge: Hmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: W-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!? Judge: Hmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...? It was stolen from Engarde. Phoenix: I think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde... Judge: S-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!? Phoenix: Maybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: And so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Maybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court! Phoenix: E-EXCUSE ME!? Edgeworth: Mr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!? Phoenix: ... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he? Judge: *sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\" It was a spare costume. Leads to: \"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\" Phoenix: Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one. Edgeworth: What...? Judge: Then... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!? Phoenix: Yes, that is what I am saying. Judge: And how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...? Edgeworth: It would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release) Judge: But... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act? Phoenix: ... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!? Phoenix: Huh!? N-No, I just... Judge: Mr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!? Mia: Phoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you! Phoenix: Alright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was... Present Press Conference Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"What is this...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!? Phoenix: I... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said! Mia: I told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"! Phoenix: *gulp* Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Ah, sorry... Mia: This one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it! Judge: Now then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time? Leads back to: \"Alright. This is what I think.\" Judge: What is this...? Phoenix: On the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference. Judge: A press conference...? Phoenix: Yes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference. Edgeworth: I heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright. Phoenix: But what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night. Andrews: ... Judge: But how can that be!? Phoenix: The way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself! Judge: Th-The victim? Phoenix: Yes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"! Judge: He was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!? Phoenix: That's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference. Edgeworth: The Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\". Phoenix: Which means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde! Judge: Yes, I guess that is what it would mean... Edgeworth: But, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"! Andrews: Hmph. Judge: M-Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: I can see why you are pros at what you do. Judge: Pardon me? Andrews: Yes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan. Judge: Ms. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this! Andrews: I was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me. Judge: You...!? Andrews: Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway. Judge: He was going to ruin him, huh...? Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed! Phoenix: What!? Judge: And do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: ... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is. Judge: Ah... I see. Edgeworth: ... Andrews: I... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all... Phoenix: P-Protect Mr. Engarde!? Judge: And yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior! Andrews: Yes, Your Honor. I understand. Witness Testimony -- Protecting Matt -- Andrews: From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer. Matt had to kill Juan no matter what. And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder. My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife... But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him... Judge: Hmm... This does account for everything... Andrews: Well... I am the logical type. Mia: We're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit. Judge: If the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!) Cross Examination -- Protecting Matt -- Andrews: From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Would you say that was your \"intuition\" speaking to you? Andrews: Don't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own. Phoenix: Urk... Andrews: If you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things. Phoenix: Three... things? Andrews: A motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear. Mia: You should have already known that, Phoenix... Phoenix: They didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember... Andrews: May I continue now? Andrews: Matt had to kill Juan no matter what. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference? Andrews: Yes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde. Judge: And you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews? Andrews: Yes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume. Phoenix: But... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference. Andrews: Oh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference? Phoenix: A-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony! Judge: Yes, I agree. Ms. Andrews, please correct your testimony, if you please. Andrews: \"Grasping at straws\" now, are we, Mr. Wright? Changes statement from \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" to \"I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\" Andrews: I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Has Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally? Andrews: ... Why do you ask? Phoenix: You were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out! Andrews: ... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern. In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill. Phoenix: (Why do I keep doing this to myself...?) Andrews: And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: B-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!? Andrews: I'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time. Judge: Hmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however. Phoenix: (The judge is glaring straight at Mia...) Mia: He's glaring at you, smart guy! Andrews: My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage! Andrews: Then... What about the button? Phoenix: The button...? Andrews: It's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume. Judge: You're talking about this button, correct? Andrews: That button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence. Phoenix: Urk. Judge: Looks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: A-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony! Andrews: I can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat. Mia: ... Phoenix: (... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...) Mia: With an icy stare, yes. Judge: Ms. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony. Changes statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\" Andrews: That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how do you know that? Andrews: When the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard. Phoenix: (Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?) Andrews: Don't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not! Phoenix: (Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?) Present Juan's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the victim's autopsy report.\" Andrews: But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time. Andrews: ! Edgeworth: Who's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it? Phoenix: This witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness. Andrews: ... Phoenix: As I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid. Mia: Really? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy. Phoenix: Wishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...) Mia: You should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk. Phoenix: Got it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!) Phoenix: This is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\". Andrews: S...Strangulation... Phoenix: The knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died. Judge: A-And what does that mean? Phoenix: Let's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when? Edgeworth: After the knife was stabbed into the victim... Phoenix: Exactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight! Andrews: Ah... Phoenix: That's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body! Judge: Order! Order! Wh-What is the meaning-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!? Phoenix: Let me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve? Edgeworth: What \"purpose\"...? Phoenix: We now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it? Edgeworth: ... Judge: Mr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!? To have a memento of the crime Phoenix: Maybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento... Edgeworth: Wright... I'll give this button to you as a memento. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: A reminder to never set foot in another court of law again for as long as you live! Judge: Yes... I think it would be for the best if you stayed away from the attorney's bench. Phoenix: W-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it! Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\" To pin the crime on Engarde Leads to: \"There is only one logical reason for doing something like that.\" To destroy evidence Phoenix: It was to destroy the evidence, of course! Edgeworth: ... Judge: ... Phoenix: Um... To destroy the evidence... Edgeworth: Yes, we heard you the first time! And which blasted piece of evidence was the person trying to destroy, Wright!? Phoenix: Umm... Judge: Mr. Wright! If you continue like this, I'm afraid you'll only destroy yourself! Phoenix: S-Sorry... Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\" Phoenix: There is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde! Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: There is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course! Judge: And... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!? Phoenix: (Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...) Mia: Phoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end! Phoenix: The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is... Present Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Adrian Andrews!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Wright. Which of these four doesn't belong here? Up, down, left, Wright. Phoenix: Um, \"Wright\"? Edgeworth: Thank you, I feel much better. I'm relieved to know you can at least pick that much out. I worry about you. You seem to fail every time you try to make logical sense! Mia: Or in other words, \"think before you speak\", Phoenix. Phoenix: (Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?) Judge: That's enough dawdling now, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Leads back to: \"The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\" Phoenix: Ms. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer! Andrews: Wh-What!? Judge: Order! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...? Phoenix: \"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews! Andrews: Wh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me! Phoenix: I can't, can I? Would you care to test me? Andrews: Then... Then what about this knife!? Phoenix: The knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you. Andrews: ...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!? Phoenix: This button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama! Andrews: Ughn... Phoenix: The only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews. Judge: I... I see... What about the empty guitar case...? Phoenix: That is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews! Andrews: N...No... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time! Judge: ...! Th-That's right! Phoenix: That's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body! Andrews: Aaaaaah! Phoenix: And to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him. Andrews: ...! Phoenix: Speaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not? Andrews: P-Please... Stop... Phoenix: Well, how about it, Ms. Andrews!? Andrews: Um... Phoenix: (I've got her this time!) Andrews: ... Judge: Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: ... I... I... I refuse... to testify. Phoenix: What was that...? Andrews: Th-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me! Judge: Well, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves. Phoenix: WHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...) von Karma: Adrian Andrews! Andrews: Y-Yes...? von Karma: Think hard about what we just discussed. Understood!? Andrews: A-Alright... ... Phoenix: (That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.) Mia: You did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done. Phoenix: Something I haven't done...? Edgeworth: Heh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence? Phoenix: ...! Judge: What is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: I'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: Everything you have proven is circumstantial. Phoenix: Circumstantial...? Edgeworth: Yes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida! Judge: M-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...? Andrews: I believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering. Judge: But Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...? Andrews: Maybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence. Phoenix: (NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...? Mia: Somehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation. Judge: I think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof. Phoenix: But! That's not true! Judge: In this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess. Phoenix: R-Recess...!? Judge: I request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial... Phoenix: (T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...) Phoenix: Phoenix: Please wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial! Edgeworth: What are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he? Phoenix: That... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya... Edgeworth: ...? Judge: But it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It is not impossible for this trial to continue. Andrews: ...! Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you... Edgeworth: It's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony! Judge: Y-Yes, that is very true, but... Edgeworth: Actually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews. Andrews: ... Edgeworth: When you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice. Andrews: Y-Yes... And...? Edgeworth: I can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice. Andrews: So my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already... Edgeworth: Before you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect. Andrews: Testify...!? Edgeworth: Your Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness. Judge: Hmm... Mia: I don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know... Judge: The court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please. Witness Testimony -- When I Found the Body -- Andrews: That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself. I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state. And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner. When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind. To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice. When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over. Judge: Hmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony? Andrews: ...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial. Mia: Phoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left... Phoenix: I know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?) Judge: Now then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- When I Found the Body -- Andrews: That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But... There wasn't anyone else in the room, right? Andrews: Of course not. Phoenix: Then... who did you pour it for? Andrews: Mr. Wright. There is a rhyme and reason for everything. Can you wait just a little longer for it to be revealed to you? Edgeworth: In other words, Wright, \"Be quiet and listen.\" Andrews: Precisely! I couldn't have said it better myself. Phoenix: Unnngh... Andrews: I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, it was a \"mess\"? Are you sure it wasn't messy because of your fight with Mr. Corrida...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I understand your frustrations at not being able to prove your theory. However... Before you go accusing people of crimes, go find yourself some evidence! Phoenix: (Grr...) Edgeworth: And then, what did you see next, witness? Andrews: And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Slumped over? Andrews: Yes, he was just sitting there with his head tilted forward, eyes closed. He really looked like he was sleeping. Phoenix: (...Is it just me or did that right there sound a little... odd?) Andrews: When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then what did cross your mind? Andrews: I thought maybe he had smashed everything up in anger because he lost the Grand Prix. And then felt tired after his rampage, so he decided to take a nap... Anyways, that's what I thought... Judge: I see. So you didn't think he was dead at all. Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\" Andrews: To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You thought he fainted...? Andrews: I thought he was asleep at first. But then, the room was in such a messy state... I thought maybe he had gotten into a fight with someone... Edgeworth: And that's when you went to pour the glass of juice? Andrews: Yes. He always has a hard time waking up. So Juan always has a glass of tomato juice to drink. Judge: Hmm... I see. And after that, what happened next? Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\" Andrews: When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how did you come to realize that he was, in fact, dead? Andrews: I shook him over and over, but I never got a response... So I set the glass down on the dresser and tried to take his pulse. I... I was shocked... and staggered backward... Edgeworth: And knocked the flower vase over. So that's what happened. Andrews: ...Yes. Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\" Mia: ... This is what it all comes down to. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: This is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case! Phoenix: (Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?) Phoenix: So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him? Andrews: No, not at all... Phoenix: Even though this is what you saw when you discovered the body? Andrews: ...Ah! Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: Isn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man! Andrews: Ah... Um... That's... Well, you see... Phoenix: I doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink! Judge: Y-Your point is...? Phoenix: Ms. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie! Andrews: Ungh! Phoenix: And your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer! Andrews: ... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: It looks like the defense has somehow brought the ugly truth to light. The defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde, is not guilty after all... Andrews: That... But that's impossible! You're wrong... Judge: M-Ms. Andrews! Try to have some composure! Andrews: It... It wasn't me... It wasn't me, I tell you! It was Matt! I swear it! He's the one who killed Juan! Phoenix: But you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you \"might\" end up incriminating yourself! Andrews: Th-That's because... Judge: Ms. Andrews, I will give you one last chance. What exactly are you hiding that may \"incriminate\" you? Andrews: ... I... I... I refuse... to testify. Judge: Then there is no need for this court to continue any further. Mr. Matt Engarde's innocence has been clearly demonstrated. Phoenix: (Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?) Mia: What's wrong, Phoenix? Phoenix: Usually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't. Judge: Now then, I would like to hand down my verdict for Mr. Matt Engarde. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor. The prosecution feels that it would be premature to pass down a verdict at this time. Judge: Wh-What...? Edgeworth: The reason is quite simple. This witness has yet to speak the absolute, real truth. Judge: The \"absolute, real truth\"...? What are you...? Edgeworth: Witness... Don't you understand yet? Andrews: ...Huh? Edgeworth: I don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you \"protect\" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the guilty party! Andrews: ...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you! Edgeworth: What...? Andrews: I... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty... Phoenix: (Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?) Andrews: I... I can't speak about it... I'm too scared... Mia: It's Franziska von Karma... Phoenix: Huh...? Mia: Don't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself. Phoenix: Th...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is... Mia: Yesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by Ms. von Karma. \"Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted.\" Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them... Phoenix: (Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!) Andrews: It wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...! Judge: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Judge: The court can't continue on like this, therefore I'd like to hear what you intend to do. Phoenix: (What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?) Edgeworth: Wright! I suggest you think very carefully about this! Think about what this witness did, and what she did NOT do! And think about who is the real mastermind behind this crime! Phoenix: (Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?) Edgeworth: Come now! What will you do!? What kind of man are you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Request \"not guilty\" verdict Phoenix: (No matter what she says... Ms. Andrews is the only person it could be! Not to mention... I don't have a choice. I have to win a complete acquittal today!) Y-Your Honor! The defense believes there is enough evidence to substantiate our claim! Therefore, we motion that this court passes a verdict of \"not guilty\" as soon as possible! Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, Wright! What have you learned in this past year!? Leads to: \"That's enough!\" Force Andrews to testify Phoenix: (I have to win a complete acquittal today... There's no way around that! But... I can't bring myself to do it like this! Not when she's making a face like that...) Ms. Andrews! I would like to know what you are really hiding! Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Are you sure you know what you're doing!? Phoenix: Sure, Mr. Engarde would get an acquittal, but in his place, you would be found guilty! Is this... Is this how you really want this trial to end!? Andrews: B-Be quiet... How dare you!? You... You're trying to trick me! Leads to: \"That's enough!\" Judge: That's enough! I commend you for trying, Mr. Edgeworth. However, it's clear that the defense's theory is the truth. Andrews: ...Y...You're wrong... Edgeworth: ... What a shame... (Changed from [Such a shame...] in the original release) Andrews: ...! Edgeworth: I had hoped things wouldn't come to this, however... Judge: Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Ms. Andrews. Since you absolutely refuse to testify... It falls on my shoulders to disclose this to the court. Andrews: ...S...Stop... Judge: M-Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: This witness... How should I put this... She has an illness. Andrews: What!? Edgeworth: And because of this illness, she has tried to commit suicide in the past. Andrews: S-Stop... Please stop...! Edgeworth: No matter how much you want to hide it, it's no use. I have the evidence right here. Andrews: Ah! Th-That's...! Phoenix: (That's the second part of the suicide report -- the attempted suicide report!) Edgeworth: What will you do now, witness? You know what I am about to do, don't you? I will now reveal to the court, the true nature of the pitiful woman known as Adrian Andrews! Phoenix: (The secret of her dependent nature... (Changed from [The secret of her co-dependant [sic] nature...] in the original release) Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...) Andrews: Please! Please STOP!! I beg you!! If people find out... If people find out... I... I'll... Edgeworth: If you're going to say you would \"choose death\", that is of no concern to me. Andrews: ...! Phoenix: (Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?) Edgeworth: However, before you die... I will pull the truth from your still-breathing lips! (Changed from [I will pull the truth from your breathing lips!] in the original release) ... No matter what I have to do. Andrews: ... Edgeworth: So, will you tell the court yourself, or shall I!? Either is fine with me. Andrews: ... ... ...I... I'll talk. But please... Help me... N-Nothing matters anymore... Witness Testimony -- My \"Crime\" -- Andrews: When I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest. When I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan. Once I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room. And then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button. Just when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience. And that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume. Judge: S-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!? Andrews: Isn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man! Judge: Wh... What do you mean by all of this...? Edgeworth: It might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth. Andrews: The real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time! Phoenix: (\"Last time\"...?) Edgeworth: So, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her \"crime\"! Phoenix: (Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?) Judge: Mr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination. Cross Examination -- My \"Crime\" -- Andrews: When I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But you could tell from the state the room was in, that there must have been a fight! Are you telling the truth when you say that you did not know he was dead? Andrews: He... had a scarf tied around his neck... But that scarf is a part of the Jammin' Ninja's costume... So... So I didn't think anything about it was strange... His head was also... tilted down a bit, so I couldn't see his face that well... That's why I thought I'd wake him up... and went to pour the juice... Andrews: When I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What is this \"plan\" you had? Andrews: ... I knew right away the murderer was Matt. I knew because Juan... He was going to expose Matt's weakest weakpoint to the world. So Matt did this to stop Juan, and silence him for good. That's when I thought, \"I should forge some evidence and pin this crime on Matt.\" Edgeworth: So the forged pieces of evidence were the knife and the button... Andrews: The first thing that came to mind was to plant the knife. Andrews: Once I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That was so you could get the knife, correct? Andrews: The knife Matt used at dinner had his fingerprints all over it. I thought if I used that, then the police would certainly turn their eyes towards him. Matt was napping with his costume on at the time. I slipped in, took the knife, and returned to the scene of the crime. Andrews: And then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were the one to stab the victim with that knife. Andrews: It gives me goosebumps to think about it now... What a horrible thing I did... But... At the time, I couldn't control my own body. It moved on its own. Then, when I stabbed Juan's dead body... I suddenly realized something. If I used the button somehow, I could make Matt look even more suspect. Edgeworth: So you thought to rip one of the buttons off and then plant it in Mr. Engarde's hakama. Andrews: Yes... That's what I had planned to do. ...But things never go that smoothly, do they? Andrews: Just when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: An \"inconvenience\"...? Andrews: There was a woman with a camera at the ready, loitering in the hallway. Phoenix: (I'm willing to bet my spikes it was Lotta...) Andrews: There was also a woman with a ray gun at the ready pacing back and forth... Phoenix: (That's Ms. Oldbag for you...) Andrews: I had already been caught and made into a big scoop for a certain weekly tabloid once, so I couldn't very well go out looking like myself and get caught again. Andrews: And that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were the one who prepared that costume, weren't you? Andrews: Yes. I took it from Global Studios... I also put it into Juan's guitar case the day before the award ceremony. Edgeworth: You did this in preparation for the press conference, correct? Andrews: Yes, Juan wanted to wear that costume and hold a press conference in it. He was going to disclose Matt's big secret there. Judge: And what is this \"secret\"...? Andrews: ... ...That, I don't know. Anyway, I thought that if I were to leave Juan's room in the Nickel Samurai costume... then people would think that Matt was the \"real\" murderer. I was very careful not to leave any fingerprints when I opened the guitar case. I absolutely did not want anyone to know about the costume. Phoenix: (I don't want to concede, but this testimony... it rings of the truth...) Mia: I'm sorry, Phoenix... Phoenix: N-No, please, don't apologize to me. We were both taken by surprise. Mia: Still, I'm sorry... After pressing all statements: Judge: I think we've heard enough! So, after that, you went back to Mr. Engarde's room and planted the button? Andrews: ...Into Matt's hakama? Yes. After that, I folded up the costume I was wearing and put it into a bag. Then I snuck it out of the hotel and got rid of it. Judge: M-My word... What does all this mean...? Andrews: ...Mr. Edgeworth, is it? Edgeworth: ... Andrews: The real criminal... is Matt Engarde!! Yesterday... That woman prosecutor sat me down for a talk... Phoenix: (Franziska, huh...) Andrews: She said that I should, under no circumstances, confess to what I had done. That if I just kept quiet, then Matt would be found guilty for sure... I... I had no choice but to believe in her words... Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: ... ............... Judge: What this witness has done is clearly unlawful. However... As long as her testimony stands, we can be certain she is not the real killer! Phoenix: W-Wait, Your Honor! The defense still... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wright. Phoenix: ! Edgeworth: It's pointless. At this point in time, it is not possible to indict Ms. Andrews on anything. Judge: Yes, exactly. There isn't a single piece of evidence that points to her as the murderer. The cross-examination of this witness is over. And so is today's trial. You couldn't establish that the witness was the culprit. Please let it go, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: B-But! Judge: Mr. Edgeworth, please place Ms. Andrews under arrest for further questioning. Edgeworth: Understood, Your Honor. The prosecution will arrange for her detention immediately. Judge: That's all. Court is adjourned for today! Phoenix: (Today's... Today's trial... It's over...! And I didn't win an acquittal!) Edgeworth: Witness... Would you mind if I asked you something? Phoenix: ...! (Edgeworth...?) Andrews: What is it...? Edgeworth: Before you leave court today, I wondered if I might look at one thing. The card in your hand. It's had my interest for quite some time now. What exactly is it...? Andrews: Oh, this...? Mr. Wright also asked about this. Although I didn't remember at the time you asked me about it, Mr. Wright, I remembered just now. I found this in the room on that day. Phoenix: \"The room\"...? Edgeworth: \"That day\"...? Andrews: Yes. I found this card when I discovered Juan's body. It was lying there right next to him... Phoenix: You found that card... next to the victim's body? Andrews: I suppose I must have unconsciously slipped it into my pocket... ...But it's not as if this card has any relevance to Juan's murder, right? Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess not. But it's still a strange card, if you ask me... But as far as a clue to this case...? I don't see why...) ???: Edgeworth: Witness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry! Phoenix: E-Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Do you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time! Andrews: I... I didn't mean to... Mia: Wh-What is this all about...? Phoenix: (I've never seen Edgeworth so emotional before... (Changed from [I've never seen such an emotional Edgeworth in my entire life...] in the original release) That card... What in the world is it? And what does it mean...!?) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Farewell, My Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 March 22, 5:24 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Pearl: Mystic Maya... M-Mystic Mayaaa... *sniffle, sniffle* Phoenix: There, there, Pearls... Pearl: I... I can't take it... anymore... ...Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... Phoenix: L-Look! It'll be alright! Everything may still work out. Pearl: Hm...? Phoenix: The condition was that we had to get a \"not guilty\" verdict. And so far, the kidnapper has kept his word and hasn't hurt Maya. And he won't because Mr. Engarde hasn't been given a \"guilty\" sentence yet! Pearl: Unngg... Nnmff... *sniffle, sniffle* Phoenix: Cheer up! We don't have time to stand around crying! We have to get going! Pearl: ... Y-You're right... Mystic Maya is in much more pain than I am! Phoenix: Yes, that's right. So... ???: Hey! You guys! Glad I caught you, pal! Pearl: M-Mr. Scruffy Detective... Phoenix: (...Oh boy. Looks like Detective Gumshoe... has been dubbed \"Mr. Scruffy Detective\" in Pearls's book now...) Gumshoe: It's just plain ol' \"Mr. Dick Gumshoe\" now, and I came to talk to you, pal! Phoenix: (But we're kind of busy right now...) Examine Charley the plant Gumshoe: Hey, it's wilting a little! Pearl: I'll... I'll give it some delicious water, pal! Phoenix: Ah, it's OK... I already did that... Gumshoe: ...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...? Phoenix: (Did he just call the watering can, \"Mr.\"?) Poster Pearl: This is the... uh... Nickel Samurai, right? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, that's right. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!? Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. Pearl: Oh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either... Gumshoe: B-But I can read AND I'm tall, pal! Phoenix: P-Please stop competing with an 8 year old... It's disturbing... Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night! Gumshoe: B-But I can get it even more cleaner, pal! Pearl: Aaah! That's... That's for the toilet!! Phoenix: (What a mess. Literally...) Talk The future Phoenix: So, what are you going to do from now on? Gumshoe: Whadaya mean, pal? Phoenix: Well, you've been fired, right? So, do you have a new job lined up yet? Gumshoe: Oh, that! A-Ah... What am I supposed to do now, pal!? I... I don't have anything coming in at all until my next payday! Phoenix: Wh-What are you talking about!? You don't have another payday! Gumshoe: ... I guess that means I'm just gonna half [sic] to work here at your place, pal! Phoenix: S-SAY WHAT!? Gumshoe: You'll be searching for things that will prove Mr. Engarde's innocence all day, right? Phoenix: W-Well... yeah... Gumshoe: So yeah! I'm going to help you, pal! I've got lots of experience in investigating, and watching over people's places! And I'm great at making really simple meals, pal! I'll take care of it all! Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's let Mr. Scruffy Detective take care of things! Phoenix: A-Ah... OK... By the way, what's your best dish? Gumshoe: Instant noodles, pal. Phoenix: (Why am I surrounded by people who only eat cheap, unhealthy foods...?) Edgeworth Gumshoe: ...That was the first time I've ever seen Mr. Edgeworth act like that... Never thought he'd say something like, he didn't care if Ms. Andrews killed herself... Pearl: H-He said that!? That's horrible... Gumshoe: But because of him doing that, we got the truth finally. Phoenix: ...The truth... (Ms. Andrews' last testimony; I wonder if that was the truth...?) I'll give you that there was nothing strange in her testimony itself. But... I still think there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole thing. Gumshoe: You mean about \"that\" thing, pal? Phoenix: Why would she want to -- no, I mean, almost \"need\" to frame Mr. Engarde... I couldn't figure that out from anything she said all day! Gumshoe: ... Then... Then you're saying that testimony... was a lie...? Phoenix: Not a lie, per se... It just feels like there's more here than meets the eye. Or that's what Edgeworth would like us to believe... Pearl: Th-That's such a dirty trick! Even that woman prosecutor was better than that! Phoenix: (Franziska von Karma...) Speaking of Ms. von Karma, do you have any more information on her condition? Wasn't she shot this morning!? Franziska (appears after \"Edgeworth\") Gumshoe: Ms. von Karma was shot today on the way to the trial by a pistol, pal. Phoenix: B-But she's going to be fine, right? I mean, Edgeworth said she was in \"stable condition\", but... Gumshoe: Well, she was shot in the shoulder, so she's OK and still hanging in there. They should be done taking the bullet out, so she's probably resting at the hospital. Phoenix: Which one...? Gumshoe: What? Are you going to visit her, pal? Phoenix: N-No... Well, I was kind of thinking about it... Gumshoe: Hey! You've actually got a heart, don't you!? She looked like she was being tortured to death not being able to go to the trial today, so maybe it'd be good for her if you went and let her whip you for a bit, pal! Pearl: Let's go let her whip us, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Now I'm DEFINITELY not going. Gumshoe: Um... let's see... The name of the hospital... Oh yeah! The \"Hotti Clinic\"! Phoenix: (That name sends a chill down my spine... Well, I guess it can't hurt to stop by and say hi...) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Look, it's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Oh! It's a little tarnished, don't you think, pal? Don't worry! I'll make it all sparkly shiny again! Phoenix: (I... I'm really touched...) Radio Transceiver Gumshoe: Have you heard anything from the kidnapper...? Phoenix: ...No... not yet. Gumshoe: I'm sure once he hears what happened at the trial today, he'll call, pal. But remember! You can't provoke him when you get to talk to him! Jammin' Ninja's Button Gumshoe: When I saw that button, I thought to myself, \"This is gonna prove Mr. Engarde's guilty!\"... But it looks like there was a lot more to it than I thought, huh pal? Phoenix: You're a pro. You should know better than to say something like that. Gumshoe: W-Well, I'm not a cop anymore. Just a regular helper around the office now, so... Phoenix: (I wonder if he misses working down at the precinct...?) Knife Gumshoe: Who would've thought that this knife Mr. Engarde used to eat his dinner steak with... Phoenix: Go on... Gumshoe: ...That it would be stabbed into the victim's body by Ms. Andrews, of all people. I guess she just hated the victim that much, huh pal? Phoenix: The question isn't why she hated the victim to that extend, but rather why she tried to pin the murder on Mr. Engarde. Pearl: I wonder if she really hates Mr. Engarde? Lotta's Photo Gumshoe: So this \"Nickel Samurai\" was really Ms. Andrews, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. This is either when she went to Mr. Engarde's room to get the knife... ...or when she was done with the foul deed. But I guess we'll never know. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: It'll be OK! You'll see her again, little missy! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Gumshoe: It's really important that you don't give up! Pearl: O-OK! Phoenix: (I guess a big voice really does give you a sense of presence...) Pearl: I... I won't give up. Ever! Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Cheer up! You can't give in, missy! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Gumshoe: Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol... ... I... I don't have my pistol or my police badge anymore... Pearl: Cheer up! You can't give in! Gumshoe: Y-Yeah! Phoenix: (What are those two doing...?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: People are jealous of my roguishly cool \"detective look\", pal. It's because of this look that I passed the detective's test, you know. Phoenix: Oh. Gumshoe: But you know, people can't coast through life on their looks alone, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, you can't count on your looks alone. Pearl: Wow... I learned something new today... Franziska von Karma profile Phoenix: Is she alright...? After being shot, I mean... Gumshoe: Her wound isn't that bad... Well, the gunshot wound anyway... But the wound to her pride, now that's a different story, pal. Phoenix: The wound to her pride? Gumshoe: Well, until now, she's always upheld the \"Von Karma Creed\", but since she came here, well, you've given her pride quite a beating, pal. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: I mean, she may act all grown-up, but she's really still just an 18 year old. ...Quite frankly, I worry about her, pal. Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: That's the first time I've seen that side of Mr. Edgeworth, pal. Forcing people to say what he wants them to during testimony... I want to know what in the world happened to him all this time he's been gone... Matt Engarde profile Gumshoe: I can't believe it. Maya getting kidnapped all because of this guy... I mean, what kind of person is the real murderer anyway!? Pearl: Maybe they're a big fan of Mr. Engarde? Phoenix: (But the kidnapper's voice... He sounded like an old man to me...) Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: My impression of her has totally changed, pal. Phoenix: Um... So, where is she right now...? Gumshoe: I'm sure she's being questioned down at the precinct. At the very least about messing with the body, and obstructing the investigation. And she'll probably be staying over at the detention center... Phoenix: (The detention center, huh...) Celeste Inpax profile Gumshoe: She was Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor. Phoenix: (Because of the suicide of the mentor she depended on, Adrian Andrews tried to follow her in an attempted suicide... Now the question is, who is Ms. Andrews relying on now...?) Anything else Phoenix: Could you please take a look at this...? Gumshoe: Um... I can't think of anything to say about this, pal. ... Wh-Why don't I make us some instant noodles, instead? Phoenix: Th-That's OK... Really. March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (From what the guard told me... It sounds like along with Mr. Engarde, Ms. Andrews is also being detained here.) Pearl: Then we should talk with them since we're here... Phoenix: Yeah, but both of them are still in questioning. Pearl: Hmm... And we don't have time to waste. Phoenix: (Yeah, visiting hours are almost over...) Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitor's the visitor's room. Catching a few z's while he's standing; now that's a good way to spend free time. March 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby Pearl: Alright now, Mr. Nick! Let's go look for clues! We have to, for Mystic Maya's sake... ???: You shall not pass! Phoenix: *gasp* Ms. Oldbag! Oldbag: Don't devalue my name and turn it into a gasp, you spiky-headed poof! Because of you, I've been made to look like the bad guy again! Although, I did get a piece of gum from Edgey-boy, just as he promised... But what I really wanted was something much more valuable! I wanted Edgey-poo's heart! I want it all for me! It's all your fault! You've awakened the wild beast inside of this Oldbag! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! (Changed from [Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!] in the original release) Pearl: Aah! Ms. Oldbag! Oldbag: Keep your hands off of me! This helmet is airtight! No air's [sic] gets in and no air gets out! Phoenix: Umm... Then why do you keep putting it on...?Umm... What does your helmet have to do with anything? Oldbag: Hmph! Don't tal release ({{{2}}})hink you can get me to move with silly questions! You're going to have to defeat me if you want to get by! Phoenix: (I'm not hearing this...) Examine Anywhere Oldbag: Hey! I said no restless loitering and no touching! You're interfering with my watch, and that's a no-no! Phoenix: (Argh. Looks like in order to search around here... I have to first get this kooky \"alien\" to go away...) Talk Any options Phoenix: Um... Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Oldbag: Hah! You're a million light-years too early to be asking ME questions, whippersnapper! Phoenix: (Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky \"alien\"...) Present Anything Phoenix: Umm... Could you please take a look at this...? Oldbag: Hmph! Sorry, sonny. I can't see it very well through this helmet! Phoenix: (Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky \"alien\"...) Oldbag: I see that look in your eyes! You stop thinking I'm an alien from outer space this instant! March 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Pearl: Wow. Everybody looks really busy with something or another... Phoenix: Hmm... They're probably strengthening the evidence for tomorrow's trial. Detective: Hey! Hurry up with that, will ya!? Pass that victim's list around! ...Now you're speaking nonsense! There's more than 100 people on there! Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick...? Is Mr. Engarde a really bad, terrible criminal...? Phoenix: ... Actually, Pearls, never mind. It sounds like they're working on a different case... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"...Very well. Now why do you want to work for our company?\" \"Well, that would have to be because I feel I would like to help this company grow.\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for corporate interviews. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Prosecutor von Karma was shot in front of the courthouse!? Wh-Who did it!? Who shot her!? Phoenix: (I have a sneaking suspicion that even Gumshoe could do this guy's job...) After clearing \"Franziska\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices: March 22Hotti ClinicReception Phoenix: (...Never thought I'd ever come back to this place...) ???: Hmm, yes... Are you here to visit a patient? Hmm... Phoenix: Ah, hi... ...Wait a second! You're...! ???: Hmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. Phoenix: Why are you still here!? Hotti: Hmm, yes... What is it? Hmm... Can I help you? You can tell me... Hmm, yes... ???: Director Hotti! Phoenix: E-Edgeworth... Hotti: Hmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. ...Oh, you're the man from this morning. Hmm, yes... What is it?... Uh huh... Edgeworth: Director. Franziska... How is Franziska von Karma? Hotti: Hmm... You don't need to worry. Hmm, yes... She's in good hands... Because, you see... I'm personally taking good care of her... Hmm, yes... Hee hee. Hmm, yes... and that thing... that surgery... It went well. Edgeworth: ...You have my gratitude. Phoenix: (It looks like Edgeworth doesn't know about this \"Director\" and his secret...) Hotti: She looked so pitiful -- absolutely terrified. Hmm, yes... But I understand, hmm... Hmm, yes... Her opponent was a gun, after all. Uh huh. And when I snuck up on her real secret-like, she would scream really loud. Hmm, yes. Edgeworth: I see. Hotti: Ah, but she's really cute too. When I'd do that, she'd whip me with her whip, uh huh... Boy did I cry like a baby. Hmm, yes... But I think I could get used to it. Hmm... Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! von Karma: Go back to your room. Hotti: You're so mean, uh huh... So mean... my frisky Friska. But that's good too-- Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! OK, OK... I... Hmm, yes... It's time for my IV drops. Hmm, yes... von Karma: ... And what are those tulips doing in your hand, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Argh! I knew I shouldn't have come here!) Examine Waiting room on left Phoenix: This must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients. Hotti: Hmm, yes... well, visiting hours are over. That's why... Hmm... It's time for nightly consultations to begin... Mine, that is... Heh heh heh. Phoenix: (...Isn't there anyone keeping an eye on this guy...?) Door at the back Phoenix: (I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?) Hotti: Oh, that's the X-ray room. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: H-H-How did you know what I was thinking!? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, it's... Because that's the X-ray room... Uh huh, yes... Phoenix: (There is something very peculiar about this guy... Because I know it's not me...) Limping patient Phoenix: This patient is undergoing rehabilitation. Hotti: Wasn't that patient standing in the same spot the last time you came to visit? Doesn't look like they've moved any closer to the reception desk, huh? Is this clinic really doing anything!? Is that patient really getting better!? Hmm... Phoenix: Hey! Don't just cut into my monologue like that! I'm explaining things here! Hotti: Ah, sorry. Hmm, yes... Most sorry... Yes... Uh, huh... Reception area Phoenix: This is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's \"Word to the Wise\": \"Put your best foot forward.\" Putting this up at a general clinic like this is doesn't really mean much, does it...? Talk The shooting von Karma: I was shot in front of the courthouse, in my right shoulder. Hmph... It's no big deal. This sort of thing happens all the time. I even had full intentions of running the trial this morning. Pearl: But! But that would've been too much for you! (Changed from [But! But that would've been too much!] in the original release) Phoenix: (There's no need to act tough in front of us, you know...) (Changed from [Yeah! You looked like you were deathly scared until only a few minutes ago...] in the original release) von Karma: Regardless, I was dragged here by THAT man over there. (Changed from [But I was dragged here by THAT prosecutor.] in the original release) He was so unyielding, one has to wonder if he was simply interested in stealing my case. (Changed from [He even went so far as to grab me by the wrist the whole way here.] in the original release) Edgeworth: It was the only logical course of action given the bullet was still lodged in your shoulder. But by taking over the case... (Changed from [But with me doing so...] in the original release) I found myself having to clean up after you and that irresponsible deal you made. von Karma: ...! Phoenix: (I think I know what \"deal\" he's referring to...) The deal Phoenix: Ms. von Karma. You made a deal with Ms. Andrews yesterday, didn't you? von Karma: I don't know what you mean. Phoenix: In order to make sure you got your guilty verdict on Mr. Engarde, you told Ms. Andrews to not testify in court today. von Karma: Hmph, I don't know what you're talking about. Do you have proof that I made such a deal? Phoenix: Y-You're denying it!? von Karma: ... It looks like you were lucky, Mr. Phoenix Wright. If I had been in court today, this trial would already be over. Phoenix: All while hiding Ms. Andrews' own crime? von Karma: That isn't my problem. Whether she had tampered with evidence or not... I have only one objective. To find Engarde guilty of murder. The end justifies the means, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The end justifies the means. Present Anything Phoenix: Aah! von Karma: ... Phoenix: (I guess that's all I get...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Ms. von Karma. Adrian Andrews believed you when you said, \"If you don't tell the truth of what really happened, then Engarde will be found guilty.\" von Karma: And what does that have to do with me? Phoenix: Because of that, she is now in danger of being found guilty herself! All because she believed in your words until the very end... von Karma: ... That still has nothing to do with me. She's just a weak person, that's all. Phoenix: But you had to know she was... OWWW! von Karma: ... I think visiting hours here are about over. So, if you'll excuse me. Pearl: What's wrong? Why did she suddenly cut you off...? Phoenix: (Probably because she thinks I had the advantage in that argument... ...Edgeworth...) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: What happened today at the trial, Edgeworth? That was not like you at all... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: I mean, I know you knew about Ms. Andrews' condition. You could have made her testify as many times as you wanted, but to go that far...! Edgeworth: ...Ah, but she wouldn't testify about THAT until I said something. Listen, Wright. The courtroom is a garden of judgment. I am putting myself on the line when I stand in there. And that's why I made the witness do the same... It's only natural. Adrian's card Phoenix: By the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you. Edgeworth: Witness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry! Edgeworth: Do you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time! Phoenix: That card... What in the world is it? Edgeworth: ... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it. Phoenix: I-I understand. Edgeworth: Their task is to find the \"owner\" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that. Phoenix: (An assassin!?) Picture Card added to the Court Record. Adrian's card (subsequent times) Phoenix: By the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you. Edgeworth: Witness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry! Edgeworth: Do you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time! Phoenix: That card... What in the world is it? Edgeworth: ... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it. Phoenix: I-I understand. Edgeworth: Their task is to find the \"owner\" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that. Phoenix: (An assassin!?) Assassin (appears after \"Adrian's card\") Phoenix: So who is this \"Shelly de Killer\"? Edgeworth: \"De Killer\" is the name of a long standing line of assassins. Pearl: Long standing? Edgeworth: The name first appeared about 100 years ago, I hear. Shelly is the professional name of the third heir to the De Killer name. Phoenix: So because his professional name is \"Shelly\", he leaves cards with a shell on them...? Edgeworth: He has a habit of making sure to leave a card by the body of his victims. Pearl: Why would he do something like that...? Edgeworth: We think it is a part of his duty to his clients. Phoenix: His \"duty\"? Edgeworth: If he leaves a card, then his clients can be assured it was he who killed the victim. It also serves as insurance against any charges being pushed onto his clients. Phoenix: ...I see... Edgeworth: De Killer values the trust between his clients and himself above all else. It seems that this is one honorable assassin with a moral conscience. Phoenix: (I guess that even honorable assassins can exist...) So, you think this assassin... You think he's the one who did the killing in this case? Edgeworth: It would appear that way. The discovery of the card basically confirms it, wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: (Shelly de Killer, huh...) Maya's situation (appears after \"Assassin\") Leads to: \"I noticed something at the trial today.\" Present Anything Edgeworth: ...I've been put in charge of this case. So I can't give you any help with reagards to clues or evidence. Phoenix: You sure are hardnosed. Totally different from Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: ...And that is why he was fired. Phoenix: (He's got a point...) Edgeworth: I noticed something at the trial today. You were behaving in a very strange manner. ...Is something the matter? Phoenix: (I guess... I should just tell him.) Maya... She's been kidnapped. Edgeworth: K-Kidnapped? What does the kidnapper want!? Phoenix: An acquittal. Edgeworth: ... I see. I had no idea. ... I will prepare a rescue team as soon as possible, and resolve this by tomorrow. Pearl: R-Really!? Did you hear that, Mr. Nick!? M-Mr. Edgeworth is going to... Phoenix: Stop trying to console me, Edgeworth! I don't need your pity! Pearl: Mr. Nick? Phoenix: There's no way you can find her. We don't have even a single clue to go on. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: There's only one way to save her. I... I have to get an acquittal somehow! It's the only way! Edgeworth: ... Wright. Listen, you need to know something. Juan Corrida was killed by Shelly de Killer. And the client who ordered the job... is Matt Engarde... Your own client. Phoenix: Please, stop! ...I can't listen to you. I can't believe that. Edgeworth: ...I see. Well, if you want to continue your investigation, you will need this. Pearl: What is it? Edgeworth: The hotel right now is restricted to police personnel only, as we are looking for any clues that might lead us to Shelly de Killer. If you take this with you to the hotel, I'm sure they will let you enter. Letter of Introduction added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: ...In any case, I must attend to the preparations for Maya's rescue team. We'll meet again, if anything should happen. Now if you'll excuse me... Pearl: Mr. Nick? Do you... Do you think... Mr. Engarde hired an assassin...? Phoenix: No way! (I mean, he doesn't have a Psyche-Lock...) Pearl: Y-Yeah, I guess not... Phoenix: Maya... Please... All I ask is you make it home, safe and sound! Date:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Maya: Heh heh. I guess even kidnappers can be a little clumsy. Clumsy enough to drop a card like this for me. And even though he said he was an \"assassin\", I bet he's just making that up, like how Nick does with everything in court. Anyway, let's try out the card trick with this card I just found... ...*click*... Maya: Sounds like I got the door open... OK! Time to go take a look around! Examine Door Maya: I've unlocked the door with this card... I should probably go and take a look around... Date:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Maya: Wh-What is this place...? I've got a feeling I'm not in the hotel anymore... Are those videos over there? ...Well, I'll worry about that later. For now, I should be looking for clues. That way, I can show them to sis and maybe get out of here! Examine TV Maya: Wow, I've never seen a TV this big before. Now where's the power button... Hmm... ...*click*... Maya: ... Phooey. It's busted. I would so die a happy Samurai fan... if I ever got to see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this. ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about dying, all things considered... Satellite dish Maya: What is this thing? An antenna... I guess? And this is... a VCR? There sure are a lot of electronic gadgets here. But what is an antenna doing here...? Computer Maya: Oh, hey. It's a computer. I've never really used one before. ... Um... I have no idea where the power switch on this thing is... Drat. There goes my plan to use this somehow to get out of here. Table Maya: There's a framed picture sitting on this coffee table. It's a picture of a woman... She's kind of pretty. Hey, looks like something's written here... Let's see... I think it says, \"With love... Celeste\" I bet this could be a clue... Sofa Maya: ...That's weird. What's a figurine doing on a sofa in a place like this...? I think it's... a bear. Aww, how cute! But it's got a lot of cuts and slits on it... I wonder if it's some kind of puzzle or something... Video tapes Maya: It's so dark in here that I can barely see, but... these kinda feel like... video tapes... All of them... Just what kind of room is this...? Door Maya: Unngh... Locked. Of course. And it doesn't look like I can use the card to open this door. There's a little hole at the bottom of the door. If only I was a little skinnier. Then maybe I'd be able to crawl through there... After examining satellite dish, table, sofa, and door: ???: Oh, this simply will not do... I cannot have you wandering around at will. Maya: Eeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ???: ...It seems... that your Mr. Wright is truly concerned about you. Maya: He is...? ???: For now, I would suggest you remain cooperative. If you cannot, there are ways in which I can help you... Maya: Ways... You mean... ???: \"Dead men tell no tales\" is how the saying goes, correct? Maya: \"D-D-D-D-Dead\"!? ???: I'm almost certain I told you on our first meeting. I am... an assassin. Maya: N-No way... You're lying... I mean... An assassin...? ???: ...People are not always who they appear to be. Maya: Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick! March 22, 7:04 PMHotti ClinicReception Pearl: Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Hm? O-Oh yes, Pearls? (Got caught up in my thoughts about Maya's situation...) Pearl: Mr. Edgeworth has left, you know. Phoenix: (I guess for now, I have no choice but to believe in Mr. Engarde. But I think I should listen to his story one more time...) Alright! Let's get going, too. Pearl: OK! March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Jailer: I'm sorry, but visiting hours are over for today. Pearl: Aw... Phoenix: (Argh... I have too many questions I need to ask...) I-I'm sorry, but I'm Phoenix Wright, a lawyer for one of the... Jailer: You're Mr. Wright, you say? Oh, yeah, there's a message here for you. Phoenix: A message...? Jailer: It's from Matt Engarde. ...Ah, here you are. Pearl: What did he write!? Is it something really important...? Phoenix: I don't know. Well, let's see what it has to say... \"To Mr. Lawyer dude, I've got something really important to tell you.\" (Changed from ['To the lawyer dude. I've got something really important to tell you.'] in the original release) (Why do I feel uneasy all of a sudden...?) Engarde: ... ... Oh, Mr. Wright. So actually... I have a favor to ask of you. I have this cat named Shoe. I didn't put out a lot of food when I left the house, so he's probably pretty hungry. You think you could drop by my house and feed Shoe for me, dude? My house is just a little ways down from the hotel, alright? Phoenix: ... Pearl: Th-This is terrible! Let's hurry! We have to feed his cat! I'm sure poor Shoe's stomach is growling by now! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I guess... Matt's Note jammed into a pocket. Phoenix: (A client's request is a request... Guess I should go check up on his cat.) Hotel Lobby Present Letter of Introduction Leads to: \"Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...\" Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...) Um... Ms. Oldbag... If you would look at... Oldbag: What!? You want me to look at this worthless piece of... .................. ...Edgey-pooooo... Phoenix: (Ugh... Is that her perfume, Ph\u00e9romone d'Amour, I smell...? *shudder*) Oldbag: Let's see here... \"Would you please allow this unsophisticated young person to conduct his investigation? Yours truly, Miles Edgeworth\" Phoenix: \"Y-Yours truly\"!? Oldbag: Hmph, that man's good at flattery. Fine. But only because Edgey-poo said so, you understand!? Letter of Introduction given to Ms. Oldbag. Oldbag: I just thought of something I have to do. Remember, no messing around! You do anything bad and I won't let you off the hook! Pearl: It looks like she has strong feelings for Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: That may be, but you know nothing's going to come of it. Pearl: That's so mean, Mr. Nick! Feelings are meant to be told and shared! Phoenix: Owww... (Every time we talk about love, I always end up with a handprint on my face somehow.) Um, so anyway, let's continue our investigation. Pearl: OK! Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Phoenix: Ack! What!? What now!? Oldbag: One little thing, before I forget. You can't go into Engarde's room today. Pearl: Why? Oldbag: The police's main investigation team is going to be in there all day, you hear? Phoenix: (I wonder if they're the team in charge of investigating \"De Killer\"...?) Oldbag: So don't go in there! Set one foot in there and you'll face the wrath of Wendy Oldbag! Examine Stage Phoenix: It's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but... Pearl: But that press conference... Phoenix: It was really the victim, Juan Corrida, trying to disclose something about Mr. Engarde. Pearl: But they're both heroes... Why would they do something so un-heroic? Phoenix: They may look like heroes on the outside, but on the inside, they're only human. Pearl: ... After clearing \"Maya's situation\" Talk option in Hotti Clinic - Reception, then visiting Detention Center: March 22Engarde MansionLiving Room Phoenix: (Hmm, sure is dark...) Pearl: I'll go turn on a light! Phoenix: Wow... So this is what a star's house looks like. Must be nice to be rich. Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's find Shoe, the kitty-cat! Shoooooe! Shoe: Meow. Phoenix: So I guess this is Shoe. Pearl: Ah, what a lovely cat. ...Hello, Shoe. Shoe: Meow. Pearl: ...Tee hee. Phoenix: (The cat seems to like Pearls.) ???: Pardon me... Phoenix: ! ???: May I help you with something, Mister... Phoenix: Oh, uh, we're lawyers. Actually, I'm Mr. Engarde's lawyer. ???: The master's... Then, you must be Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes. ???: Ah, it's a pleasure to meet your wonderful self. Doe: I am the family butler, John Doe. Phoenix: Nice to meet you. Shoe: Meow. Examine Fireplace Pearl: Oh! There's a giant cooking hearth here. Phoenix: That's actually a fireplace. Pearl: How are they different, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... (You know, I've never actually seen a hearth before, come to think of it...) Pearl: You should come and visit Fey Manor, then. I'll show you one when you do. Motorcycle Pearl: A... A giant bicycle is flying through the air! Phoenix: ... That bicycle, Pearls, is one where you don't have to pedal, and it moves on its own. Pearl: Really!? Wow! Phoenix: But sorry to disappoint you, it can't fly. Pearl: ...Oh. That's too bad. Lounge set Phoenix: It's a very comfortable and spacious lounge set. I wonder if famous stars drop by and sit around and have a good time. ...In any case, I don't really belong here, do I? ... Argh. What is with me and feeling inferior today...? Pearl: ? Masks Pearl: Ah! There are masks here! Phoenix: Yeah. That one in the middle is the Steel Samurai. The ones next to that are the Pink Princess and the Evil Magistrate. They fought many battles against the backdrop of Neo Olde Tokyo. Pearl: Wow, you really know a lot about the Steel Samurai, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: ... (I don't know whether to laugh or cry that I know more about that show than a kid...) Doorway behind railing Phoenix: There's another door over there. Pearl: You shouldn't go wandering off over there, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: ...Yes, Pearls. (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her to stop playing around...) Door Pearl: There's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: I bet it's for Mr. Engarde's cat to use. Pearl: Oh, you mean Shoe. Phoenix: (The door... It's locked tight. Well, I guess that's to keep nosey people like me from entering it.) Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: You must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right? Doe: Honestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs. Phoenix: (Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...) John Doe Phoenix: Mr. Doe, how long have you served at this residence...? Doe: Well, sir, I would have to say... maybe about one year? Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of himself and his affairs. Phoenix: (You know, I would've thought Mr. Engarde the kind to have a maid over a butler...) ([maid] in quotation marks in the original release) Shoe Phoenix: That's a very cute cat you've got here. Doe: It is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat. Phoenix: (...Well then. I guess I don't need this piece of scrap paper anymore.) Matt's Note crumpled into a ball and thrown away. Shoe (subsequent times) Phoenix: That's a very cute cat you've got here. Doe: It is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat. Present Matt Engarde profile Phoenix: You must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right? Doe: Honestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs. Phoenix: (Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...) Any evidence Phoenix: I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look at this. Doe: I'm afraid I cannot offer up anything special about it. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of evidence for a trial. Phoenix: (Polite yet snotty with a touch of rude. He's the stereotypical butler alright.) Any other profiles Phoenix: Would you happen to know who this person is...? Doe: No, I would not. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master's acquaintances. Phoenix: (Then what in the world CAN I talk to you about!?) Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! Being angry is bad! After clearing all Talk options: Doe: ...Well, I'm afraid I must take my leave of you now. Phoenix: Oh, we should probably get going ourselves. Doe: Ah, so young and yet already so accomplished. A master of law... Phoenix: But there is also a lot to be proud of in being a butler, in charge of the house and all. Doe: Thank you for the compliment, sir. ...People are not always who they appear to be. ...Now if you'll excuse me. Shoe: Meow. March 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall Phoenix: Looks like we're the only ones here. Pearl: And yet... the hotel seems so busy somehow... Phoenix: (Probably because the police team is scouring for clues about \"De Killer\"...) Examine Front table Pearl: I want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again... Phoenix: Yeah, me too... Pearl: Whenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot. Phoenix: Well, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast! Pearl: OK! Let's work really hard, then! March 22Gatewater HotelHallway Lotta: Hey, City Boy! Phoenix: L-Lotta... You're still here... Lotta: Reckon course! An investigative photographer eats or starves on her ability to snap up the scoop, yeah!? And this hotel just has that \"aura of mystery\". Ya know, like something's always about to happen. Pearl: But... Do you have a camera? Lotta: Reckgiven! A photographer's gotta have cameras out the ear like corn to be a real pro, ya know!? So I'm hangin' around here... ... ... Speaking of cameras and feedin' the mouth, do ya have mine, ya bread-thief!? Phoenix: (Why can't you drop that \"thief\" thing already?) Examine Teddy bear Pearl: Aww, how lovely! The teddy bear looks happy to be surrounded by so many beautiful flowers. Phoenix: (Pearls really seems to like teddy bears a lot.) Phoenix: Ah... I wonder if... Lotta also... Lotta: I didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word! Phoenix: (Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?) Flowers on left Phoenix: Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Although, other than sunflowers and tulips, I have no idea what any of them are. Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick? What's this flower called? Phoenix: It's a sunflower... I think. Pearl: This flower over here is pretty too. Phoenix: That's a tulip, I guess. Pearl: ... Lotta: Callin' everythin' a sunflower or a tulip; don't reckon even little kids'll fall for that! Door on right Phoenix: There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". Pearl: The old lady told us about this, didn't she? That we can't go in this room tonight. Phoenix: (I wonder if an investigation briefing is going on right now inside... Without Detective Gumshoe...) Talk Night of the murder Phoenix: I want to ask you about the night of the murder. Lotta: What? Ya really gonna shell out the bucks for the info I got!? Phoenix: Lotta, you were loitering in this hallway the night of the murder, were you not? Lotta: Well, kinda... But... Phoenix: (Brace yourself, Phoenix. Here it comes...) (Changed from [Brace yourself, Wright. Here it comes...] in the original release) Lotta: I didn't exactly hang around here the entire time, ya know. Followed a few stars around... got a few autographs, shook a few hands, had a soda-pop with a few of 'em too. Phoenix: (Looks like she wasn't here the entire time that night...) Pearl: The security lady also wasn't in this hallway the whole time either. Phoenix: (I guess this means there's no one who can tell us who came and went that night...) Scandal Phoenix: So, about the note that was inside your camera case. Lotta: Oh, that ditty I wrote? Phoenix: Yeah... Can I believe what you've written? Lotta: Ya mean the stuff about Engarde shovin' his manager lady onto Corrida? Phoenix: Yeah... Lotta: Ah, well, I reckon ya best not be believin' that. Phoenix: What? Lotta: Look, I sorta wrote that on a whim, ya know? Writin' whatever came to mind. Pearl: \"Whatever came to mind\"...? Lotta: Yeah, when ya get down to it, it's just a lotta random bull dooders. Phoenix: ... Pearl: ... Lotta: Hey, what's with ya!? Why ya starin' at me like my grandpa used to!? Phoenix: Hmph. Lotta: Hey, and why do you look like you suddenly got older too!? Or am I just shrinkin' here!? Pearl: Umm... Camera Lotta: Ah! My baby! My $1,600 baby! What's with that red-coated prosecutor anyhow!? The guy told me it was \"evidence\" and refused to give it back to me! Phoenix: Well, that's kind of how it is... Lotta: Hey, hey. Yer that red-coat's friend, ain't ya? So put in a few good words for me and git me back my camera. Phoenix: Y-You want me to do what!? Lotta: Listen, nag the guy real good fer 'bout five hours and I guarantee he'll give it back. Phoenix: Why don't you do your own dirty work...? Present Anything Phoenix: Um, would you please take a look at this? Lotta: Nope. Sorry. No can do. Only thing I wanna see is a steamin' hand towel. Phoenix: Um, what? A steaming hand towel...? Lotta: Need one for my eyes. Today just ain't a good day for my eyes to be lookin' at stuff. Phoenix: (How convenient! Maybe I'll have to use that one next time you show me something!) After clearing all Talk options: Lotta: ... Well, I reckon it's time for me to get going. A tabloid photographer without a camera is just a \"tabloid\", huh. Phoenix: Umm... Yeah, I guess so. Lotta: Keep yerself together out there, ya hear!? I'm comin' to see ya in court tomorrow. Phoenix: O-OK, I'll see you then... Lotta: And you too there, little 'un. Keep up the good work, OK? Pearl: OK! Lotta: Don't be picky about yer food, now. Pearl: OK! Lotta: And make sure ya do all yer homework, ya hear? Pearl: OK! Lotta: And if you happen to find yerself a camera, make sure ya bring it right to me, ya-- Phoenix: Would you please just leave already!? Examine Door on left Phoenix: There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". (I wonder what EXACTLY happened in the room behind this door...? Even now, no one really has any idea...) March 22Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room ???: ... Ooongh... Oooonnngh... Ooongh... Oooonnngh... Pearl: M-M-Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Wh-What is that otherworldly, ghastly moaning...!? ???: ... Ooonnnn... Oooo... Nnnghff... Ghfff... Pearl: I... I hate evil ghosts... Waaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: I don't think it's a ghost... Maybe it's a demon!? ???: E-Excuse me!? Watch who you're calling a demon, brat! Pearl: Aaaah! Phoenix: Zoinks! It's the alien!! Oldbag: Who are you calling an alien!? Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Phoenix: Oh, it's just you, Ms. Oldbag. What are you doing here? Oldbag: What is wrong with young'uns today!? I came down here to pay my respects to my poor Juan, and you're disturbing me! Examine Bedroom Pearl: So that's a bed... Phoenix: Yup. It's big, but it's a bed. Pearl: Aaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft! Phoenix: (How easily children are entertained.) Floor near guitar case Phoenix: Bottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant. Pearl: These glass shards... Phoenix: They're probably from the glass vase Ms. Andrews knocked over. Guitar case Pearl: So, the Nickel Samurai's costume was in here? Phoenix: Yeah. Pearl: I can't believe Mr. Corrida went so far, just to say bad things about Mr. Engarde... Phoenix: W-Well, it was a \"press conference\", so he had to go in costume. Pearl: But weren't Mr. Engarde and Mr. Corrida friends? Phoenix: They weren't friends. They couldn't be friends because they were rivals. Pearl: So, a \"rival\" is someone who is a \"strong enemy\"!? Phoenix: (Pearls is really fired up over this... And I don't have an answer for her.) Wine glass Phoenix: It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it. Pearl: Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much. Phoenix: There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from. Talk Night of the murder Phoenix: Please talk to me about the night of the murder just one more time. Oldbag: I talked about it plenty at the trial! I was fooled, tricked... DECEIVED by that fraud of a photographer and her note! She was loitering around here with that imbecilic look on her face! Pearl: \"With that imbecilic look on her face\"... OK, got it. Oldbag: N-Now hold on a second there you little pipsqueak! If you're going to take notes, at least make me sound better than that! Pearl: Oh, alright. Phoenix: (Now I've seen everything...) Oldbag: But you know, I was working that night too, doing my job, minding my own business. So it's not like I had time to waste standing around here the whole night. Memories of Corrida Phoenix: I was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about Mr. Corrida. Oldbag: He was the most popular star, you know... Especially where it counts -- in my book! Phoenix: But I heard that he was lagging behind in the polls against Mr. Engarde... Oldbag: Um, w-well, that's just a recent thing. Bad luck and all that, you know. But! He was going to become an even bigger star than he used to be! Look! Just look at this mountain of presents! It's a show of the mountain of feelings all his fans had for him! Phoenix: Yeah, the mountain is pretty big, and certainly nothing to shake a stick at. Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Hm? What is it, Pearls? Pearl: The presents. They're all bears... right? Phoenix: (She's got a point... There isn't a single thing here that isn't a bear...) Presents (appears after \"Memories of Corrida\") Phoenix: All of Mr. Corrida's presents from his fans seem to be... bears... Oldbag: Oh, that's because you can't think of Juan without thinking about bears! Pearl: Bears...? Why bears? Oldbag: You don't know!? When my dear Juan was training, he fought barehanded with a bear. He refused to give in and let the bear win, but after the fight, they became friends. Pearl: Wow... What a heartwarming story. Oldbag: Look, it's just like in those young people's dramas. I can see those two tuckered out, down by a river going, \"Heh... You... You sure can fight...\" \"You too, bub. You too.\" Phoenix: D-Did all that really happen? Oldbag: It's in his biography, bub. Phoenix: (What a load of crock!) Oldbag: So ever since then, fans have been giving him bears as presents. Phoenix: Yeah... Nice... Bears... After clearing all Talk options and visiting Living Room: *GROOOOOOOOOOWL!* I'm Uncle Bear, and I say it's \"bearly\" 8 o'clock! Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What is that infernal racket!? Oldbag: It's one of the presents going off. Sounds like it's already 8 PM. Way past your bedtime! Phoenix: Urk... That startled me! I thought I was going to die for a second... Pearl: Eight PM... That's the time when the award ceremony ended that night, remember? Phoenix: (Time sure flies... Hard to believe it's been two days since the ceremony...) ...*beep beep beep*... Phoenix: (The transceiver!) ...*beep*... Phoenix: Hello!? Hello!? ???: ...This is not a phone. Phoenix: Maya! How is Maya!? You haven't hurt her, have you!? ???: ...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Wright.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! ???: I have heard the news. So it would seem my present did you no good... Pearl: N-Noooo! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa! Phoenix: One more day! Please! All I ask is for one more day! I... I'll get a not guilty verdict for sure this time! Please... ???: ... I suppose if I must. I need that acquittal more than anything else, after all. Phoenix: ...Please... Please let Maya say something! I want to hear she's alright! ???: Alright... hissssss... then... hisssssss... ssssssssss... ssss... a little... sssssss... Phoenix: (What is with this static all of a sudden...!) Hello!? Hello!? ???: It seems... ssssss... hisss... sssss... bad... sssssss... hisssssssssss... ssssssssss... connect...sssssssssssss... Phoenix: (Dammit! Did the transceiver just suddenly break...!?) ???: ssssssssss... 'll excuse me... hisssssssssssssssss... ...*beep*... Pearl: Wh-What happened...? Phoenix: I don't know. All of a sudden, it became nothing but static. Pearl: Aaaah... Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya! Phoenix: (Why did the transceiver suddenly break like that...? I should probably have an electronics expert look at it... The sooner the better!) March 22Wright & Co. Law Offices Gumshoe: Hey! Welcome back, pal! I thought I'd make you a little something for dinner. Phoenix: Th...That's nice... Thanks. Gumshoe: A rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is... (Changed from [It's a rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is...] in the original release) Phoenix: I'm sorry you went through all the trouble to cook, but I don't have the time to eat. Gumshoe: Oops... Looks like you don't have a can opener, pal. (Changed from [Oh, hey... You don't have a can opener here, pal.] in the original release) Phoenix: (You've got to be kidding... And here I thought he had already whipped something up.) Gumshoe: Oh, I know! There is one way I know how to be helpful! Ask me about anything you want, pal! Go ahead! Phoenix: (Well, since he's here and offering... I wonder what I should try asking him about?) Talk Electromagnetic interference (appears after correctly presenting Radio Transceiver) Leads to: \"Um... So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...?\" Present Radio Transceiver (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room) Gumshoe: The transceiver...? Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! You should ask Mr. Scruffy Detective about that thing. Gumshoe: What thing? Phoenix: Oh yeah! This thing just up and broke all of a sudden! Gumshoe: It... It broke, pal? Phoenix: When I was talking to the kidnapper, it just suddenly broke into static... Look, it sounded like this. ...*beep*... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: I don't hear any static, pal. Phoenix: H-Huh?? Pearl: Maybe it fixed itself? Phoenix: That's strange... I'm sure it was making a loud static noise. Gumshoe: Hmm... Maybe... Phoenix: Maybe what? Gumshoe: Maybe it was \"electromagnetic interference\", pal. Phoenix: \"Electromagnetic interference\"? Picture Card Phoenix: Oh yeah! Do you know about this card? Gumshoe: Card? Phoenix: Edgeworth, for some reason, went pale the instant he saw this card. Gumshoe: Hey, I know what this is, pal! Phoenix: You do? Gumshoe: No matter what way you look at it, I'd say it's a picture of a shell. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Um, that's it? Gumshoe: Oh yeah! That's right! Mr. Edgeworth really likes those cooked snail things. Um, what are they called again...? \"Escargot\" or something like that...? Pearl: Mr. Nick! I think we just solved the mystery of why Mr. Edgeworth's face turned pale, right!? Phoenix: (As I suspected, Gumshoe has no clue...) Phoenix: Um... So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...? Gumshoe: It's something that happens when a radio wave gets mixed up with another signal, pal. Phoenix: Oh, when you put it that way... Pearl: I don't understand what you're talking about... Gumshoe: Like for example, when a cell phone goes off next to a computer screen, the stuff on the screen gets kinda fuzzy and starts acting funny, right? Pearl: Huh? ...\"Kom-pu-ter\"? Gumshoe: ... Um, it's like when you use the dryer next to the TV, and the screen starts looking weird. Pearl: O-Oh, yes, the TV does do that! Hmm... Oh, so that's what you're talking about! Phoenix: (She seems amazingly happy at being able to understand this...) Gumshoe: So the room you were in when that interference to the transceiver happened... There's gotta be something there that's sending out very strong radio waves, pal! Something like... Hmm... Like a listening device or something. Phoenix: Ah! Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of that! Where were you when it happened? Pearl: We were in Mr. Corrida's room... The scene of the murder! Gumshoe: What!? That's it! I'm going to sneak into the precinct and get a bug sweeper! I'll meet you at the crime scene later, alright pal!? Phoenix: Ah, wait! Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Oh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah! Pearl: We should be going too, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Alright, let's go! Examine Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night! After clearing \"Electromagnetic interference\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices: March 22Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room Gumshoe: Hey! You're finally here, pal! Phoenix: S-Sorry to keep you waiting. Pearl: Do you have the... um... \"bug sweeper\"? Gumshoe: Um, well, you see... I got busted trying to sneak in, pal. Then suddenly, I'm staring at the precinct doors. ...From the outside, I mean. So yeah... I couldn't get one of the police bug sweepers... Phoenix: ... What do you mean you couldn't get it!? We need that item! Gumshoe: Hey, hey, calm down, pal. I didn't say I didn't get one, just not the police's. Pearl: Wow... So this is a \"bug sweeper\"... Phoenix: It looks a little... broken. Gumshoe: Hey, this was made when I was in elementary school, pal. Phoenix: Oh? By who? Gumshoe: Me, of course! Ah, seeing this sure brings back memories... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: Hey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little beat up... (Changed from [Hey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little run down...] in the original release) But I put my heart and soul into building this puppy here! Pearl: Your heart and soul...? Gumshoe: It'll work! Trust me, pal, it'll do the job! But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: But you can't set the sensitivity... So it's going to beep at anything that gives off electromagnetic waves. Pearl: But isn't it better that way? Gumshoe: Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! Well, anyway, since I brought it all this way, might as well give it a whirl, right pal? Phoenix: (I'm getting that sinking feeling again...) Gumshoe: OK, now I'll tell you how to use this baby! There's a listening device or some other sort of bug hidden in this room, pal. Pearl: So we're going to find it, right? Gumshoe: Right. Now, first, let's turn the sweeper on. Next, move the sweeper around to give the room a real thorough lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the sweeper and take a real good look around the room with it, pal.] in the original release) The sweeper'll let you know how strong of a signal it's picking up, so keep an eye on it, OK? (Changed from [You can see how strong the radio waves are in an area by looking at the CHECK gauge.] in the original release) Once you find something that's giving off a lot of radio waves... (Changed from [Once you find something that's giving off strong waves, the gauge will change...] in the original release) ...press [the A Button / Enter] to lock on to it. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the thing a long hard stare.] in the original release) There's a lot of things here that's going to give off radio waves, so let's take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Alright! I'm going to go stand outside and keep an eye out. Give me a yell if you find the bug. Got it, pal!? Bug sweeper Calculator Phoenix: It's a plain old calculator. Pearl: It says \"50\" on it. Maybe he was calculating his allowance? Phoenix: (A whole 50 cents?? Um, maybe if he was a spirit medium...) Dryer Phoenix: And here we have a dryer... Nothing unusual here, I think. Pearl: A dryer...? Oh! if you use it next to a TV, it'll make the screen look all weird right? Phoenix: ...Y-Yeah. Pearl: And when that happens, it's called \"electromagnetic interference\", right!? Phoenix: Hey, good memory Pearls! Pearl: I will never forget it for the rest of my life! Clock bear Phoenix: Well, it certainly looks like an alarm clock. Pearl: What's wrong? Why do you look troubled? Phoenix: I just can't imagine the listening device being inside this alarm clock. It just, um, sort of reminded me of something that happened a long time ago... Pearl: Oh... Phoenix: Well, anyway, it looks like the listening device isn't in here. Box next to clock bear Pearl: Wow, there's a really delicious loaf of bread in here! Phoenix: Looks like it's been on \"keep warm\" all this time since the murder. Pearl: Well, Mr. Scruffy Detective always says, \"Got to keep the trail and crime scene warm.\" Phoenix: (I think the \"keep warm\" in that case is a little more metaphorical...) Video camera Pearl: What's this? Phoenix: It's a small video camera. ...No listening device in this gizmo. Pearl: Everyone's trying to make everything smaller and smaller lately, aren't they Mr. Nick? Phoenix: That's what it seems like. Pearl: But! I want to grow bigger and bigger! Phoenix: (Well, eating only vegetables isn't going to help you there. You have to eat meat too...) Remote control Phoenix: It's the TV's remote control. But it doesn't look like the listening device is in here. Pearl: Um, so I was thinking... I wonder if a TV remote works on other things... Like... Could I make you change your expressions like TV channels? Zap! Phoenix: H-Hey! (Hmm, but if I could... Ooh, the people I would give the ol' mute button to!) Well, I don't think it's going to work on me... Why don't we try it on Maya tomorrow, OK? Pearl: ... OK! Laptop Phoenix: There's no listening device in that notebook computer, huh. Pearl: Umm... What's a \"notebook computer\"...? Phoenix: ... Do you know what a \"notebook\" is? Pearl: Yes! It's a small book with paper that you can write on! ...So? Phoenix: Well, that thing is like a notebook in a way. It's basically a small laptop. Pearl: Umm... Mr. Nick... What's a \"laptop\"...? Refrigerator Pearl: This is a... a refrigerator, right? Phoenix: I really don't think the listening device is in something like this. Pearl: Because it's filled with nothing but healty vegetable juices, right!? Phoenix: Uh, yeah, sure. (What does that have to do with listening devices?) Coffee pot Pearl: What's this? It sort of looks like a hot water pot, but... Phoenix: Oh, well, it's kind of like a hot water pot, I guess. But instead of hot water, coffee comes out. Pearl: Really!? Th-This pot can do that!? ... Um, is there a pot that orange juice comes out of...? Phoenix: I don't think there's anything like that, Pearls. Sorry. Water pot Pearl: Oh, the water in this hot water pot has run out! I'll go get more water for it! Phoenix: O-OK. Sounds good. (Looks like she's forgotten all about looking for the listening device...) Large bear near coffee machine Leads to: \"This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right?\" Air conditioner Phoenix: Well, the listening device isn't in the air conditioner. Pearl: Aah! Yuck! This air filter is covered in dust and dirt... Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Pearl: ... Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's wash it! Phoenix: (I wonder if being a neat freak makes even the tiniest dust bunny look colossal...?) Pearl: ...What? Phoenix: O-Oh, nothing. TV Phoenix: I don't really think the listening device is in the TV of all places. Pearl: Looks like the TV was left on, and it's now showing an old samurai movie. Phoenix: Yeah. This channel plays all sorts of international movies, as well as domestic ones. Pearl: You know, every time I watch one of these old movies, I always think, \"Wow, these Japanese stars are really good at English!\" Phoenix: ...Um, yeah. Pearl: When I grow up, I want to study Japanese! Phoenix: (I should probably keep my mouth shut here, and not destroy her dream...) Lamps Phoenix: Lamp, check. Listening device... nope. Pearl: There are a lot of lamps in this room, aren't there Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. Pearl: And they're all on. You shouldn't do that, Mr. Nick. Don't you know that's wasteful? Phoenix: ...Ah, yeah... I'll be more conscientious from now on. Sorry. Cell phone Phoenix: A cell phone... Nope, no bugs in here. Pearl: A \"cell phone\"...? Phoenix: Wh-What!? Don't tell me you don't know what a cell phone is! Pearl: ...I'm sorry. I've never seen one before... Phoenix: (Now that she mentions it, my cell phone couldn't get any reception while I was staying in Kurain Village... And Pearls has never lived outside of that village, so... Well, I guess I can't say it's impossible to live without one...) Landline phone Phoenix: Well, the phone is the most common place for a \"listening device\", I'd say. But, let's take the receiver apart first before we get ahead of ourselves here. Pearl: Wow, you know a lot about electronics, don't you Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, I know tons. Especially when it comes to taking them apart. It's my specialty. (I'll leave the fixing part up to Gumshoe...) Pearl: So...? Is there a \"listening device\" in there? Phoenix: ...No. (And I really thought it had to be in the phone too...) Bear between the two sofas Pearl: Ah, what a lovely bear... *GROOOOOOOOOOOOWL!* Pearl: AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! Phoenix: Ah, this must be one of those fancy bear-shaped toy robots. Pearl: I-It's a robot!? It's a REAL robot!? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, it's a real one. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Pearl: H-How many horse-powers is it? How many horsies!? Phoenix: Horsies...? ... Phoenix: Um... Well, look, it's a bear, so... uh... Pearl: Um... Radio Pearl: The radio is on and playing something. Oh! It's \"Kids' Question Corner\"! \"Professor! Professor! Why is the Earth round?\" Pearl: ... Yes, why is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... Why don't you listen to the radio program a little more, Pearls? Pearl: This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right? It's the biggest one I have ever seen! Gumshoe: Hey! So did you guys find it yet? The listening device, I mean... Pearl: No, not yet. But this bear's eye is... Gumshoe: Let's see, let's see... A perfectly normal stuffed bear with some really strong radio waves... Sounds like you found the device to me, pal. Let's dig this big fella's eye out and see what we've got. Pearl: N-No! You can't! Such... Such a violent act... Gumshoe: Oomph! *rip!* Pearl: Noooooooooo! Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Th-That's! Gumshoe: It's a miniature camera... And it looks like there's more. There's a... transmitter, and a timer. Phoenix: A whattawhatta-mitter? Gumshoe: A transmitter, pal. Pearl: Oh... Is this more of that \"high tech\" stuff...? Talk Camera Phoenix: So this tiny thing is a camera...? Gumshoe: Yup. It's a pinhole CCD camera, pal. It's a small, high-grade video camera mostly used in security systems. Phoenix: So it's a video camera... Gumshoe: It runs on a battery, which comes with it in a set. Phoenix: But... there's no video tape in this camera... Gumshoe: This is only the camera part here, pal. The tape recorder with the tape inside it is somewhere else. Pearl: Somewhere else? Gumshoe: The footage is changed into radio waves and then it's sent to that recorder. Pearl: So... It's sort of like a TV broadcast, isn't it? Gumshoe: Hey, you know, you're right! Spy Camera added to the Court Record. Camera (subsequent times) Phoenix: So this tiny thing is a camera...? Gumshoe: Yup. It's a pinhole CCD camera, pal.

Gumshoe: The footage is changed into radio waves and then it's sent to that recorder. Pearl: So... It's sort of like a TV broadcast, isn't it? Gumshoe: Hey, you know, you're right! Transmitter Phoenix: So... what is a \"transmitter\"? Gumshoe: It's a device that sends footage the camera took to a specific destination. It's like a video version of a listening device, pal. Phoenix: It looks like it's attached to a small, clock-like thing... Gumshoe: Oh, that's a timer, pal. You can set it to turn the camera on and record at a certain time with it. Pearl: You can set it for a certain time...? Gumshoe: Yup. Let's see... This looks like it was set to start at 8 PM and go for one hour. Phoenix: Eight PM? (That was the time the award ceremony ended!) Gumshoe: There's no date set, so it's been recording every night, I'd guess. Pearl: M-Mr. Detective! How long has this bear been here...? Gumshoe: Um, I'm pretty sure it's been here since the night of the murder. Pearl: Then... Then maybe... Gumshoe: Maybe this camera caught the murder on tape! Phoenix: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: And if you think about the angle the bear is at... It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal! Transmitter added to the Court Record. Transmitter (subsequent times) Phoenix: So... what is a \"transmitter\"? Gumshoe: It's a device that sends footage the camera took to a specific destination.

Gumshoe: And if you think about the angle the bear is at... It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal! Stuffed bear Pearl: So there was a camera... in this bear's eye... Phoenix: And it was disguised as a present. Gumshoe: And I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal. It's pretty big, so it stands out pretty well in my mind. Phoenix: But... who gave Mr. Corrida this present? Gumshoe: I, ah, don't know, pal. But! This means that someone out there's got a video of what happened here that night! Pearl: Isn't there any way we can find out who that person is? Gumshoe: It's impossible, pal. Radio waves can be sent almost anywhere, so there's no real way to find out... Pearl: Oh... *sniffle* Phoenix: (Is there really no way to find out...?) Stuffed Bear added to the Court Record. Stuffed bear (subsequent times) Pearl: So there was a camera... in this bear's eye... Phoenix: And it was disguised as a present. Gumshoe: And I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal. It's pretty big, so it stands out pretty well in my mind. Phoenix: But... who gave Mr. Corrida this present? Gumshoe: I, ah, don't know, pal. But! This means that someone out there's got a video of what happened here that night! Pearl: Isn't there any way we can find out who that person is? Gumshoe: It's impossible, pal. Radio waves can be sent almost anywhere, so there's no real way to find out... Pearl: Oh... *sniffle* Phoenix: (Is there really no way to find out...?) Present Picture Card Gumshoe: So... the assassin's name is Shelly de Killer? Phoenix: Yeah. Gumshoe: And because he's \"Shelly\", that's why he leaves a \"shell\" card? Phoenix: Yes. Gumshoe: ... Ho ho ho ho! Oh, that's great. But you know, no matter how strange I may seem, at least my jokes don't make you cringe. Right, pal? Phoenix: (Umm... Yeah, you keep on thinking that...) Spy Camera Pearl: It's a really tiiiiny camera. Gumshoe: A camera this size lasts about 3 hours with a fresh battery pack, pal. Phoenix: But what would something like this be doing in...? Gumshoe: Well, I'd say taking a secret video of the murder. Phoenix: (Which means... Someone knew there was going to be a murder here!) Transmitter Gumshoe: This device looks like it was made by the criminal themselves. If it's only sending images, then I'd say it'd last about 80 hours, pal. Pearl: You know a lot about these things, don't you Mr. Detective? Is spying on people a hobby of yours...? Gumshoe: Well, no... I mean... You're making me embarrassed, putting me on the spot like this. Phoenix: (Why should he be embarrassed? Is there something I'm not getting here...?) Stuffed Bear Pearl: The bear is really lovely, isn't it? It's so soft and fuzzy, and the face is really well-made... Phoenix: (Well, I guess when you compare it to all the other presents, it is well-made.) Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think the bear itself is a clue to this case at all. After clearing all Talk options: Gumshoe: ... ...I got it! Phoenix: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: Hey, pal. Let me borrow this mini camera for a bit! Phoenix: Wh-What are you going to do? Gumshoe: I'm going to go around to the electronic shops and see if I can find out who bought this! Phoenix: B-But that's impossible! I mean, it's already 9 PM! Gumshoe: Leave it to me! Even if I have to search all night, I'll find your man, pal! Spy Camera and Transmitter given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Oh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah! Pearl: ...He's gone. Phoenix: ...Yeah. Pearl: But Mr. Scruffy Detective sure is a nice man. He's pushing himself so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake... ???: It's a mystery how you always manage to do things in the most inefficient ways, Wright. (Changed from [...You always manage to do things in the most ineffective ways.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Ack!) Edgeworth: You'll have to excuse me. I heard your conversation just now. Phoenix: E-Edgeworth! What are you doing here!? Edgeworth: A rescue team has been created and deployed. I can't say I'm optimistic... but we have to move forward, one step at a time. Phoenix: I-I see... Thanks. Edgeworth: Don't thank me yet. We still have to find her. Pearl: ... Edgeworth: Hmm... So, there was a spy camera hidden inside this stuffed animal, huh? You are one lucky man, Wright. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: Do you know this stuffed bear, little girl? Pearl: Um... I have no idea! Edgeworth: Hmph... Of course not. The maker of this bear is a very expensive, luxury brand from overseas. It's completely hand-made, and only a small number of these are exported here. (Changed from [It's completely hand-made and there are very few that are exported here.] in the original release) Phoenix: Wh-What? Edgeworth: The camera and transmitter that scatterbrained detective took with him are dead ends. Things like those can be bought anywhere... However, this bear is different. By tracking how it got into this country, this bear can tell us who the buyer is. Pearl: C-Can you really do that!? Mr. Nick, can he really? Phoenix: W-Well, I guess so... Edgeworth: Hmm... It's 9 PM. I think I can still make it in time. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: I'll be taking this for now. I'm sure you have other things you have to do. Stuffed Bear snatched up by Edgeworth. Edgeworth: See you soon, Wright. Phoenix: W-Wait! Edgeworth: What? Phoenix: Why are you doing this...? Edgeworth: ... I have no interest in explaining myself to someone who cannot comprehend. But besides that, Wright. Until court reconvenes tomorrow, you should concern yourself with this question: \"Who was the person that murdered Juan Corrida?\" Phoenix: The \"real killer\"... Edgeworth: Do you really still think it was Adrian Andrews? Phoenix: To be honest... I don't know anymore. Edgeworth: ... You still have a little time left... Find the truth, Wright. Everything begins with the truth. Phoenix: (Juan Corrida's real killer... Ms. Andrews' past... The kidnapper whose sole condition is an acquittal for Mr. Engarde... And... this card. Shelly de Killer...) ...Maya. The only way I can save you now, is to find all the answers to this case tonight! I don't understand what your real intentions are, Edgeworth... but as you said, all I can do for now is find the truth! To be continued. March 22, 9:14 PMGatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room Pearl: It's past 9:00 PM already, isn't it? I wonder... I wonder if Mr. Edgeworth has already found Mystic Maya...? Phoenix: (These things take time. I'd say probably not...) The police are professionals, Pearls. They'll find her, so don't you worry. And if we can win a not guilty verdict tomorrow... then everything will be OK. Pearl: Y-You're right... ... Talk The real killer Phoenix: So the real person who killed Mr. Corrida was... Pearl: That assassin... Mr. Shelly de Killer, right? Phoenix: And the card Ms. Andrews found at the crime scene seems to be proof of that. But if that's the case, then a new question comes to mind. Who was the one that hired De Killer to begin with? Who is his client? Pearl: You mean... Who asked for the murder...? Phoenix: That person didn't want to dirty their own hands in blood, but whoever this client is, they're still a killer. Pearl: ... The assassin's client Pearl: Who... Who could have hired the assassin? Do you think it was Ms. Andrews...? Phoenix: (I wonder... But if she was the client... then why go through the effort to stab the knife into the corpse herself...?) Pearl: But if Ms. Andrews wasn't the client... Then... No, it can't be... Phoenix: (...Matt Engarde himself...?) Was it Matt? (appears after \"The real killer\" and \"The assassin's client\") Pearl: If Mr. Engarde really did hire the assassin... Phoenix: Then he is not innocent at all. Far from it, he would be guilty of the crime. Pearl: B-But it can't be Mr. Engarde, right!? I mean, when we first talked with him... Phoenix: ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida? Engarde: ... Alright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK? Phoenix: (I didn't see any Psyche-Locks at that time... Actually... That reminds me...) Pearl: Did you remember something, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, something Ms. Andrews said at the trial today. She said something interesting. Something interesting (appears after \"Was it Matt?\") Pearl: Um... So what is this \"interesting thing\"? Phoenix: Oh, that's right. You didn't hear it, did you Pearls? Andrews: Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway. Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed! Pearl: Mr. Engarde's \"secret\"...!? Wh-What is this secret...? Phoenix: I don't know yet. But for now, let's think about it this way. Mr. Corrida was going to reveal this \"secret\". That means... Mr. Engarde had plenty of motive to have Mr. Corrida silenced. ... (Which means we have to meet with Mr. Engarde. There's no way around it now.) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: I... I believe in your lawyer powers, Mr. Nick. I know you can bring us a miracle. Phoenix: (I'm guessing by \"miracle\", she means a not guilty verdict... And she wouldn't be wrong either. It will take a miracle to pull this one off.) Radio Transceiver Pearl: Why... Why did the kidnapper have to take Mystic Maya...? Why couldn't he have taken me instead!? Phoenix: Stop it, Pearls! Don't say things like that! If that had happened, then Maya would be hurting, I'm sure of it. Just like how you are hurting now, Pearls. Pearl: Y-You're right... Maya Fey profile Pearl: One more day... Phoenix: Yeah... If we can bring the trial to its end, she'll be back. Don't worry. Pearl: I decided I won't cry anymore, Mr. Nick. You're so brave and holding strong for Mystic Maya, so I have to do the same. Pearl Fey profile Pearl: If only I had studied harder during my training... I could be a bigger help to you, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Ah, don't worry about it. Really. Pearls, you're doing a great job... Pearl: Mr. Nick! Is there a waterfall around here!? I feel that I must be made new under the rushing spring waters! Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... The only body of water around here is a lake. Pearl: Oh... Thanks anyway... Dick Gumshoe profile Pearl: This is the first time I've ever met someone who loves to eat instant noodles. Phoenix: (Something tells me Gumshoe isn't eating them because he genuinely likes them, but...) Pearl: He's working so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake... I'm going to get him lots and lots of instant noodles as a thank your present! Juan Corrida profile Pearl: Um... Is it really that important to be the Master of all the Stars? So important that you try to find your friends' weaknesses, and then expose them...? Phoenix: I... I wouldn't know... Matt Engarde profile Pearl: I-Is it really alright for us to trust him? This person... Mr. Engarde...? Phoenix: ... (I-I don't know... I can't even answer that for myself. We have to go see him one more time! That's the only way to know for sure!) Security Lady profile Pearl: Um... I was wondering if that old lady is really a person from Earth. I mean, maybe she's really from waaaaaay out in outer space... Phoenix: Yeah, actually, I was thinking the same exact thing. She's too strange to be from Earth. Adrian Andrews profile Pearl: Why did Ms. Andrews... Why did she frame Mr. Engarde, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (She has some sort of grudge against Mr. Engarde... But why is that? That's something we still have to figure out...) Let's go ask her, OK? Celeste Inpax profile Pearl: This person was Ms. Andrews' mentor... And she... killed herself, right? Phoenix: (Right. And Mr. Corrida hid Ms. Inpax's suicide note... So to get it back, Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... But the thing is, where is that suicide note now?) March 22Gatewater HotelHallway Pearl: Wow, it's really getting late, isn't it Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. It's past 9:00 PM already. But we still have some things to prepare for tomorrow's trial. (There's still the matter of this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida held about Mr. Engarde... And Ms. Andrews' real intentions. These are two things I must know tonight!) Pearl: But aren't visiting hours over at the detention center? Phoenix: Hmm... I'm sure we'll think of something, Pearls. Don't you worry. March 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall Oldbag: ... Phoenix: Hey! Wait! Oldbag: What is it, whippersnapper!? All I know is nothing that has anything to do with you is ever good! Like just now. I was handed this strange device for who knows what reason. And I was told to use it to search the whole hotel. Phoenix: That's... the bug sweeper, isn't it? (The one Gumshoe made...) Oldbag: I don't know and frankly, I don't care. But the request came from Edgey-poo, so... Phoenix: Edgeworth...? Oldbag: And he said, Edgeworth: \"If you feel angry, direct your anger at that unsophisticated lawyer.\" Oldbag: So, I'm going to feel free to direct all my anger towards you! Phoenix: (Ugh... Gee, thanks a bundle, Edgeworth! What a pal you are!) Examine Tables at back Phoenix: They haven't cleaned up all the food yet. Oldbag: Don't you touch it without permission! I brought a lunch box today, so I could pack it. Pearl: Um... But... Hasn't the food been out for two days already? Oldbag: When it's in your stomach, it's all the same! Phoenix: (Wow, the digestive powers of an alien are wondrous...) Front table Pearl: I want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again... Phoenix: Yeah, me too... Pearl: Whenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot. Phoenix: Well, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast! Oldbag: My mind's like a steel trap, so I'm going to hold you to that! Phoenix: (I was NOT talking to you!) Talk Bug sweeper Oldbag: This is absolutely top secret, so you had better keep it to yourselves! I heard they found a spy camera hidden in one of the presents! Phoenix: Hmm, very interesting. Oldbag: I'm sure it was... you know... It was to catch poor Juan in the middle of a scandalous \"meeting\"! Pearl: \"Scandalous\"...? What's that? Oldbag: It means... Well, you know, that gossip that's been going around about my dear Juan. Phoenix: Oh... You mean that thing about Ms. Andrews. (But I'm sure she must've had some reason for getting close to Mr. Corrida...) Oldbag: I'll let you in on another secret, young'un. I know who planted that spy camera! It was that obnoxious, puffy-haired photographer girl! The nerve of some people! Spying on people by herself! As if I wouldn't want to see it for myself too! Phoenix: (Wow! The alien actually admitted her true intentions for a change!) Oldbag: I don't know what you're thinking exactly, but I can bet that it's nothing good!! Phoenix: (But I didn't say anything...) Juan and Adrian Oldbag: So you want to know about Juan and that manager, right? Actually, as I hear it, they were something of a refreshing pair, those two. Phoenix: Oh? Oldbag: I tell you, Juan really welcomed that manager with open arms, I heard. Pearl: That \"manager\"...? Who are you talking about? Oldbag: You don't know? That manager woman Juan had. It's a shame she killed herself, though... Phoenix: Oh, you're talking about Ms. Celeste Inpax... Ms. Andrews' mentor, right? Oldbag: Yes, yes, that's the one! That Celeste girl. She was supposed to get married, you know. Phoenix: M-Married? You mean... to Mr. Corrida? Oldbag: *sigh* Really, you young kids today don't know anything, do you? That girl Celeste killed herself three days after their marriage announcement! Phoenix: (Three days after their marriage announcement!? What in the...!?) Celeste's suicide (appears after \"Juan and Adrian\") Pearl: Why would Ms. Inpax want to kill herself!? She was going to get married! Oldbag: Well, that's because... she was thrown away, you see, by Juan. Phoenix: What!? Pearl: B-But... They were going to get married, right? They promised each other, right? Oldbag: They held a grand announcement session... But... Three days later... Juan suddenly cancelled their marriage. Phoenix: I-Is that true? Oldbag: It was in the weekly magazines. Pearl: B-But why!? Why did he do that!? Oldbag: That was not in the magazines, unfortunately. Phoenix: ...I see. Oldbag: That night after Juan called off the wedding, that manager, Celeste, killed herself. Phoenix: How terrible... Pearl: I wonder what happened between those two...? March 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby Phoenix: On that night, there must've been at least a few hundred people here. Hmm... I guess the police are done with their questioning and investigating. It looks like things here in the lobby have finally calmed down. Examine Second floor Phoenix: A lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. When the murder happened, it was abuzz with people running back and forth... But now since things have quieted down, it actually feels more eerie than before. March 22Engarde MansionLiving Room Phoenix: It looks like no one is around... Pearl: Um, what happened to that person with the stuffed teddy face...? Phoenix: (Oh, she must mean that butler with the stitches in his face.) Pearl: Shoooooe! Shoe: Meow. Pearl: Oh, there you are. I guess you're still awake, huh Shoe? Shoe: Meow. Pearl: Hee hee, come on, let's play. Phoenix: (I wonder if that butler, Mr. Doe, is already asleep or not...) March 22Wright & Co. Law Offices Pearl: It doesn't look like Mr. Scruffy Detective is here. Phoenix: Well, he's out there with that camera asking around at all the electronic stores. Pearl: Then, I'll make some salad for him for dinner. Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls really appreciates what Gumshoe is doing for us...) Pearl: ...Um, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Hm? Yes? Pearl: Where is the lettuce? Phoenix: ...I don't think I've ever bought lettuce before. Pearl: ... Aww, I guess I have to give up on making a salad, then. Phoenix: (Guess the lack of lettuce is kind of a problem.) Examine Charley the plant Pearl: Oh! I'll water it! Phoenix: Ah, it's OK... Gumshoe already gave it more than plenty earlier... Pearl: ...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...? Phoenix: (Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...) Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh, I'll wipe it some more and make it super shiny! ...The wiping cloth... Where are you, Mr. wiping cloth...? Phoenix: It's fine. Really. If you wipe it any more, it'll be so shiny I'll be using it as a mirror. March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Visiting hours ended a few hours ago. Looks like we're not going to get a chance to talk with Mr. Engarde tonight... Pearl: B-But... Isn't what we have to ask very important? Phoenix: (Yeah, but I don't think that matters to the guard...) Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Visiting hours ended hours ago, so what's the camera watching over now? Pearl: Maybe it's watching the Mr. Policeman who's standing over there. Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think that's it...) Guard Phoenix: Visiting hours ended hours ago, so what's he watching over now? Pearl: Maybe he did something bad and he's standing there as punishment. Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think that's it...) March 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Pearl: It feels sort of tense in here, doesn't it Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (Yeah, it does. I wonder if something happened...?) Chief: You're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, right? Phoenix: Ah, yes sir. Chief: Well, we've finally found just the person we've been looking for. A real decisive witness. Phoenix: A \"decisive witness\"? You mean for Mr. Engarde's case? Chief: We're taking the witness's statement right now. Gotta hand it to Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: (What's Edgeworth up to now...?) Pearl: Wh-Who is this witness? Chief: I think you know this person quite well, Mr. Lawyer. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: (Between the kidnapper's demand and now this... I can't see any way to win here!) Chief: Oh, yeah... Mr. Edgeworth wanted me to tell you something. Phoenix: He did? Chief: Even though visiting hours are long over at the detention center, he wanted me to grant you special permission, so there you go. Pearl: What!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release) Chief: I've already called them so they know. Go on, go talk to your heart's content. Phoenix: Thank you very much. Pearl: This is such good news, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (\"Go talk to your heart's content\"? It sounds like the police are pretty sure they have tomorrow's trial in the bag.) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"It seems as though my true face has been revealed... I was an elite businessman who made deals with the entire world! I was the young successor and CEO of a colossal corporate conglomeration! But my real self is that of a regular everyday policeman!\" Phoenix: ... Stop doing image training, and get yourself out there in the field!! Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: Whaaat!? \"The real killer in the Corrida murder is an assassin...\"!? This must be someone's idea of a joke. I can't believe this garbage! Phoenix: (Have a little more faith in your own subordinates!) Blue Badger Chief: This mascot here is the \"Blue Badger\". I made him, you know. I'm finally gonna show him off to the Chief of Police tomorrow. Phoenix: Wow, that's really something. Chief: You have no idea how much time and effort I invested into him to get this far... But my hopes for this little guy go far beyond just this precinct, yessiree. I'll get him deployed to every precinct in the nation. Just you wait. Pearl: I wish you luck, sir. After clearing \"Something interesting\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room, clearing \"Celeste's suicide\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Hotel Lobby, and visiting Criminal Affairs Dept.: March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (I'm sure they must have transferred Ms. Andrews here by now... So that means that both Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews are in this detention center. Now then, whose story do I want to hear?) Matt Engarde Engarde: Dude! It's Mr. Wright! I hope you can get me off the hook tomorrow. I'm counting on you! Phoenix: I... hope so too... (Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me by saying... (Changed from [Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me and said...] in the original release) that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that the assassin's client is... (Changed from [that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that assassin's client is...] in the original release) this man... Matt Engarde...) Engarde: What's wrong? Phoenix: ...Mr. Engarde. There is something I must know with one hundred percent certainty. Engarde: Hmm, you seem kinda different. You're totally not like your usual lawyer dude self. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitor's the visitor's room. He's sleeping standing up. The night's pretty long, and he probably got tired. Hmm... I hope he doesn't fall over... Talk Matt's secret Phoenix: Um, about the \"press conference\"... Engarde: You mean the one where Juan was gonna dress up as the Nickel Samurai? Phoenix: Yeah. I heard a little more about it from Ms. Andrews. Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed! Engarde: ... Phoenix: Could you please fill me in on what this \"secret\" is? Please? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew this was coming...) Pearl: Mr. Nick? D-Don't tell me... Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks...) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock...] in the original release) Engarde: You said a \"secret\", right? But I don't have any idea what it is. Do you dude...? (Changed from [You said a 'secret', right? But you don't have any idea what it is, do you dude...?] in the original release) Matt's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: This is a very important matter! Please! You must tell me! What is this \"secret\"!? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Engarde: Hmm... Well... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult my lawyer, OK? Phone: ............ ...*beep*... Phoenix: H-Hello? This is Phoenix Wright. Engarde: Oh, hey Mr. Lawyer dude. Sorry, but you know dude, you totally don't have any idea. And I really didn't care at all about what Juan was up to, OK? Phone: ...*beep*... Engarde: So, it's like that. Phoenix: ... (Looks like I have no choice but to remove those Psyche-Locks...) Juan and Adrian Phoenix: Did you know about Mr. Corrida and Ms. Andrews' relationship...? Engarde: Well, it's all over the tabloids, dude. Ah, but I don't know any of the details, if that's what you mean. Look, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't care what Juan did with his life. Phoenix: Ms. Andrews... She had a purpose in mind when she started seeing Mr. Corrida. Her mentor was Mr. Corrida's manager... and Ms. Andrews was going to get Ms. Celeste Inpax's suicide note from him. Engarde: Celeste... Phoenix: Does that jog any memories...? Engarde: ... Dude, I suddenly just got totally hungry. You up for a pizza? My treat. Engarde: ... ... Pearl: Um... Mr. Nick? What's a \"pea-za\"? Is it a kind of pea, like green peas? Phoenix: Let's go eat one later, OK? Engarde: ...Argh, I got cut off by the pizza dude at the shop. Phoenix: That's too bad... Engarde: Well, how about we get our minds off of this topic and talk about something else, OK? Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde... Are you connected to Ms. Inpax's suicide in some way...?) Present Press Conference Ticket Engarde: That Juan... Posing as someone else and trying to hold a press conference...! And the person who set it all up was Adrian, wasn't it? Phoenix: That's what I heard. Engarde: Argh... I can't believe... Why would she do such a thing, dude!? Radio Transceiver Engarde: That's a very nice transceiver, dude. I'm kind of an expert in gadgety things... Phoenix: (Why does what he just said give me a sinking feeling?) Pearl: ? Guitar Case Engarde: His signature item was a guitar. Hah! I mean, dude, what kind of ninja carries a guitar!? Phoenix: Um, I'm not someone who would know... Engarde: Dude, it's such a kid thing to do. I mean, just my opinion and all. Phoenix: (Isn't your show a kid's show too?) Crime Photo Engarde: He was a bit of a talentless hack when he was alive... But who knew he could play dead so well? Wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: W-Well, that's because he really IS dead! Engarde: And quite pitifully indeed, yes? Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo Engarde: That Adrian... I never thought she'd go this far to frame me for the crime... I mean, what does she have against me? Dude, I don't get it. Phoenix: That's something I would like to know too. Do you have any ideas at all? Even the slightest clue? Engarde: Huh!? What!? Me!? D-Don't be silly, Mr. Lawyer dude! How am I supposed to know something like that? Suicide Report or Celeste Inpax profile Engarde: ... Phoenix: ...Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Dude, I know I asked you to be my lawyer and all... But I don't think I have to tell you anything and everything. Phoenix: Um... What do you mean by that? Engarde: It just means I don't have to tell you anything and everything, dude. Pearl: ... Attempted Suicide Report Phoenix: Um, about this... Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! You can't! Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Ms. Andrews said she doesn't want anyone to know about that, remember? Engarde: What's that? Phoenix: Oh, this? Um... Nothing. It's nothing, really. Picture Card Phoenix: (... I'm kind of scared to show him this card...) Engarde: What's wrong, dude? Phoenix: Oh, um... So about this picture card... Have you ever seen this before? Engarde: ...? Nope, never saw it before in my life, dude. Phoenix: (I don't think he's lying... Or is he...? Then again, he looked like he gasped just now... Maybe I'm seeing things...?) Engarde: ? Juan Corrida profile Engarde: It's true we debuted at the same time... so that's why people were always comparing us. But I totally didn't care what people were saying because he wasn't even close, dude. I mean, I won every contest we ever had, hands down! Adrian Andrews profile Engarde: I don't get it... Why would she want to frame me...? I mean, I've never done anything to her, dude... Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde sounds pretty sincere and he seems trustworthy... So I have to find out what Ms. Andrews' real intentions are!) John Doe profile Phoenix: About this person... Engarde: ...H-He's... Pearl: He is your butler, Mr. Doe, right? We met him at your mansion. Engarde: Oh... Yes, that's right. He's a pretty cool dude who can do lots of things. He takes real good care of me. Anything else Phoenix: Could you please take a look at this...? I know it may not seem important to you... Engarde: Well, if it's not important, then I'd rather be in bed. If I don't get my 12 hours of beauty sleep, my skin's gonna wrinkle up like a prune, dude. Pearl: You know, he's right Mr. Nick. Your skin's kind of drying up here and there. Phoenix: (I swear... After this case is over, I'm going to get lots and lots of sleep...) Adrian Andrews Andrews: ..Oh, it's you. Phoenix: I'm sorry to be visiting at such a late hour. But there are a few questions I absolutely have to ask you tonight. Andrews: Me? I thought your client was Matt. Phoenix: (I'm sure Ms. Andrews knows something... She can't be clueless about this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida had on Mr. Engarde...) Andrews: ... Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: I'd like to ask you about Matt Engarde, if you don't mind... Andrews: Mr. Wright... You still don't know, do you? The real him, I mean... Phoenix: ... You seem to bear a lot of resentment towards Mr. Engarde. If that's the case, then why did you become his manager? And why would you become intimate with his rival? Andrews: ... That... has nothing to do with this case. Nothing. Celeste Inpax Phoenix: About Ms. Celeste Inpax... Andrews: I had finally put her death behind me... And now, thanks to you, it's all come back to the surface. Phoenix: I... I'm sorry. Andrews: Yes, I was shocked by her suicide. And it's true that when I heard the rumor that Juan was the one who had hidden her suicide note, I began to draw close to him. I wanted to get her suicide note back... and to burn it. Phoenix: You wanted to \"burn it\"? But why? Andrews: I didn't want it to spread like just another piece of gossip. But... I never held any murderous intent towards Juan. I would never do something so stupid. Phoenix: (The suicide note, huh...? I wonder what it said?) Why frame him? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Celeste Inpax\") Phoenix: Why did you try to frame Mr. Engarde? Andrews: That's simple. Because he's the killer, that's why. Isn't it the duty of every good citizen to inform the police? Pearl: B-But... there had to be another way. Phoenix: The police are excellent at doing their job, so they'd figure it out, right? Andrews: Yes, they're so good that they couldn't figure out the real truth behind Celeste's death. Pearl: Ms. Andrews... Phoenix: Well, um, I know you're not the type of person to do something without a reason, so please, tell me why you did what you did... Andrews: ...Revenge. Pearl: Huh...? Did you say something just now...? 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (A Psyche-Lock, huh...) Andrews: Don't you understand yet? You're not my lawyer. To be honest, you're more like my enemy. Pearl: But... Phoenix: (I'm sure I just heard Ms. Andrews say, \"Revenge\".) Why frame him? (subsequent times) Phoenix: Why did you frame Mr. Engarde...? 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Andrews: Hmm, I wonder why...? I don't really know myself. When I realized what I was doing, I had already stabbed the knife into the body. Phoenix: (I'm almost sure that just now... Ms. Andrews muttered, \"Revenge\" to herself.) Present Press Conference Ticket Andrews: I was the one who organized the whole press conference. Juan wanted to deal the most damage possible to Matt's career. And that's why he was killed. It's quite simply a story of cause and effect, yes? Magazine Clipping Andrews: It appears to me that rumor was started by Juan himself. Phoenix: Mr. Corrida...? But... Andrews: I'm Matt's manager, remember. I think he wanted to embarrass Matt through his relationship with me. Pearl: But... But didn't Mr. Corrida like you...!? Andrews: There weren't any feelings of love between us. For me, it was about getting Celeste's suicide note... For him, it was about wounding Matt's pride. That's all it was. Pearl: That's... That's... Phoenix: (Poor Pearls is in shock. She sees just how cruel the world can really be.) Guitar Case Phoenix: So there was a Nickel Samurai costume inside of this case, correct? Andrews: Yes, there was. I even personally carried it here from the studio. I always thought it was such a childish thing to dress up and wear a costume like that, but I never thought that I would wind up using it myself that night. Wine Glass Andrews: When I was pouring that glass of juice... I honestly had no idea that Juan was dead... Pearl: I see... Andrews: I really am a terrible woman, aren't I? One moment, I'm thinking of looking after him, and the next, I'm stabbing him in the chest with a knife. Crime Photo Phoenix: About this photo... Andrews: The person who stabbed the body and opened the guitar case was me. Phoenix: And that was so you could get the Nickel Samurai's costume out so you could wear it...? Andrews: I thought I had executed that part quite well. But you showed me differently. You are a formidable lawyer, Mr. Wright. Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo Andrews: You know... There was only one thought running through my head at that time. \"With this, I can finally expose Matt's true nature to the world.\" Phoenix: (His \"true nature\"...? I wonder why she's saying that, but not telling me what his true nature is? If it were me, I think I'd be happy to finally get that kind of thing off my chest.) Suicide Report Andrews: I don't care what the reason was... It's unforgivable that he hid Celeste's suicide note. Phoenix: But you don't have any proof that she left a suicide note behind, right? Andrews: Celeste... She always believed there was a right way and a wrong way to do anything. She would have left a note. I... I wholly believe that. Attempted Suicide Report Andrews: S-Stop it! I don't want to remember the hopelessness and the despair I felt back then! Pearl: Hurry up and put that away, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: I-I'm so sorry! Picture Card Andrews: It was near Juan's dead body. I... I noticed it when I went to fill the glass. And then when I realized that Juan was dead... I completely panicked. That's when I must have unconsciously picked this card up and put it into my pocket. As for why...? I simply don't know. Will Powers profile Andrews: That's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be. Phoenix: (Urk... What a horrible thing to say...) Andrews: ...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright. Juan Corrida profile Andrews: He is a very prideful man... Or rather, was. He absolutely had to compete with Matt in everything, no matter what it was. He really was such an idiot. Pearl: Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: Well, I guess maybe all stars are like that. Never giving any thought to other people's feelings. Matt Engarde profile Andrews: ... Pearl: Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: That things have come to this... I have nothing left to say about that man. Not one word. Adrian Andrews profile Andrews: I hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why. Phoenix: S-Sorry... Celeste Inpax profile Andrews: Celeste... was my mentor. She was a strong woman... She wouldn't kill herself over any old trifling matter... Pearl: S-So... You have some ideas of why she killed herself...? Andrews: Yes, I suppose... Anything else Phoenix: Um, I'd like to ask you about this... Andrews: I told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me. Phoenix: (Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...) Detention Center (subsequent visits, before clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co.

Mr. Wright! Please, you have to help me! Phoenix: (Uh oh...) M-Mr. Powers! Pearl: What happened? Why are you here? Powers: I-I... Uh, you see, I got roped into this somehow... Pearl: What?? Powers: And now I'm going to testify at tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: (So the decisive witness... is Mr. Powers?) Powers: I was talking with a detective until a little while ago, and I was on my way home... When all of a sudden, \"You there! You're under arrest!\" And I was brought back here. Phoenix: O-Oh. Powers: They said my face and whole self in general looked \"suspicious\" or something. Phoenix: (Hmm... Well, I guess I can see how they thought you looked suspicious...) Powers: *sigh* I'm just a normal guy on an exercise show for kids... Is that a crime?? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"...I... I'm sorry, everyone. I've lied to you all... I... I'm not a detective. I'm really... I'm really... I'm really Global Hero Onyankopon!\" Phoenix: ... I think he's lost his grip on what's real and what isn't... Talk Tomorrow's testimony Phoenix: So, about this \"testimony\" you're giving. What are you going to talk about? Powers: Ah, I really don't know yet... But it sounds like I saw something pretty important from what they tell me. Phoenix: You saw something important? What was it? Powers: Ah, well, the detective told me not to talk about it. \"You can't tell anyone, and especially not that lawyer,\" he said. Pearl: Who do you think is \"that lawyer\" the detective was talking about...? Phoenix: I'm going to take a wild guess and say it's me. Powers: ...Y-Yeah, you got it. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya and myself are your only two allies in this whole world, but it's alright! Phoenix: (Ouch... I don't really have a lot of friends, do I...?) Matt Engarde Powers: This is going to do a lot of damage to Matt, you know. Because he's got that \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image going. Phoenix: But what is he really like? Powers: Well, let's see. Matt's always been kind of a \"player\" with women... He would never really turn a pretty face away, if you know what I mean... He'd always say, \"It's just a game\" to justify himself. Pearl: What!? H-How horrible! That's unforgivable! Powers: Oww. S-Sorry. Didn't mean to offend you. But you know, he said once that, \"There's only one person in the world who won't swoon over me.\" Phoenix: One person who wouldn't swoon over him? Powers: His manager, you know. Ms. Adrian Andrews. Phoenix: (Why is Mr. Powers suddenly looking kind of... energetic?) Gossip Powers: Ah, you see, I'm actually a sucker for gossip. I mean, celebrities and their world have this dazzling sort of image, right? Phoenix: A dazzling sort of image? But aren't you a part of that dazzle, Mr. Powers? Powers: No, I'm more of a hairy, sweaty, smelly, brutish kind of guy, you see. But it's OK, really. I get to hear plenty of gossip about a lot of the other stars around me as things happen. Phoenix: Well, that's true. Powers: Oh, hey! So did you hear about this yet? About Ms. Andrews' mentor and her suicide...? Phoenix: You mean Ms. Inpax? Pearl: We heard something about how her wedding was cancelled... Powers: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! I thought about it a little the other day! About that mysterious death! Hey, Mr. Wright! Why don't you ask me about that!? Go on, go ahead! Phoenix: (Mr. Powers is so charged up his skin is practically glowing with electricity...) Celeste's suicide (appears after \"Gossip\") Powers: Hey, so have you heard this? Celeste left a suicide note! And they say that Juan went and hid it... Phoenix: We heard about that in court today. (But there wasn't any actual proof that she had left a note...) Powers: Well, this is what I think. I think that something bad was written on that note. Something bad for Juan, that is. Pearl: Something bad for Mr. Corrida? Phoenix: Why do you figure so? Powers: Well, before she died, Celeste talked with a few of her friends. And she said, \"It looks like I got caught up with a truly insidious man...\" (Changed from [And she said, 'It looks like I may have been caught by an insidious man...'] in the original release) Phoenix: A \"truly insidious man\"...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that? (Changed from [An 'insidious man'...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that?] in the original release) Powers: Well, there's no one else that fits the bill, right? And that would be reason enough for him to hide the suicide note! Phoenix: I see... Well, that's some good info. Thank you. Powers: Y-You're welcome! Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews; they're both at the detention center right now. There are still things I don't understand or know about, I'm sure... I have to get the two of them to tell me everything!) Present Radio Transceiver Powers: Um... That kidnapper... Has he said anything since then...? Phoenix: Well... He tried, but there was a lot of interference. Powers: I see... Phoenix: (That radio interference... Who would've thought it was caused by a spy camera?) Magazine Clipping Powers: Hey! That article! Is that from \"Gossip Land\"? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I guess so. Powers: Ah, you too? I absolutely love this magazine! Phoenix: Um... \"You too\"...? Powers: Oh, they wrote a little something about me once! \"Steel Samurai's Midnight Dine and Dash\". Pearl: Dine and dash...? Powers: I bought ten copies of that issue, you know. Phoenix: (Do you think we could somehow get back to THIS article...?) Guitar Case Powers: The Jammin' Ninja made me want a bright red guitar, you know. I wanted to be cool like him, so I went out and bought one. Phoenix: Oh... That's nice... Powers: Ah, but you don't understand. I can't get a single sound to come out of it. Because I sort of tripped on it and crushed it... the day after I bought it. Wine Glass, Crime Photo, Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo Powers: I can't believe Ms. Andrews tried to frame Matt... Those two have such a strange relationship with each other, don't they? Phoenix: (Looks like Mr. Powers is just as in the dark about things as I am. I guess I don't have a choice other than to go talk to the two of them myself.) Adrian Andrews profile Powers: Hey, that's Ms. Andrews! She's Matt's manager. Actually, I was interested in her for a little bit. Just a little... Phoenix: (Hmm... So Mr. Powers likes this type of woman...) What do you know about Ms. Andrews...? Powers: Well, see... Here's the thing. I don't really KNOW her know her... you know? Ah! If you're interested, I can give you a little bit of the details! Phoenix: (He's so happy, he looks like a lion that's just found his next meal...) Celeste Inpax profile Powers: That's Juan's former manager, right? Celeste Inpax... She was with Global Studios for a while way back when... But some things happened and she ended up moving over to Worldwide Studios. Pearl: \"Some things\"? As in? Powers: Well, there's no one left around who knows the details, you know. Only rumors are left now. Any other profile Powers: Umm... I'm honored you're asking me, I don't know anything special about this person... Umm... Sorry... Phoenix: Ah, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much. Powers: S-Sorry.

Phoenix: Shh, Pearls. ...And? Go on. Gumshoe: There's only one person who bought one of those bears who's related to this crime! Pearl: Wh-Who is it!? Who would be so rude as to spy on another person in their room...? Gumshoe: ...Matt Engarde. Pearl: Huh? Gumshoe: Matt Engarde. Your client, that's who, pal! Phoenix: (And here I thought things couldn't get any worse...) Talk Stuffed bear Phoenix: Are you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was... Gumshoe: I heard it from the department store clerk, pal. This is the credit card receipt for the purchase. It's for $3,800, pal. That's an exact match to the price of that stuffed bear. Phoenix: A receipt...? That's all you have? Gumshoe: Nah, it's not just the receipt, pal. The store clerk said so himself. He told me, \"I'm sure I sold the bear to Mr. Engarde.\" I mean, the clerk even got Mr. Engarde's autograph out of it, pal. So I'm sure the person that bought the stuffed bear was Mr. Engarde himself! Phoenix: (My... My sight is failing me... Th-This can't be!) Credit Card Receipt added to the Court Record. Stuffed bear (subsequent times) Phoenix: Are you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was... Gumshoe: I heard it from the department store clerk, pal.

Gumshoe: Ah, that was a dead end, pal. I mean, you can get this kind of thing from anywhere. But for now, I guess I can give these back to you for you to file away into evidence. Spy Camera, Transmitter, and Stuffed Bear refiled into the Court Record. Spy camera (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what about the spy camera we found...? Gumshoe: Ah, that was a dead end, pal. I mean, you can get this kind of thing from anywhere. But for now, I guess I can give these back to you for you to file away into evidence. Present Radio Transceiver Gumshoe: Have you heard anything from the kidnapper...? Phoenix: Nope. Not a word since we were cut off by the radio interference. Gumshoe: Well, we know his goal is to get an acquittal for Matt Engarde... So, I don't think he'll hurt Maya, because that's not going to help him at all. Come on! We can't lose hope, pal! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Transmitter, Stuffed Bear, or Spy Camera Gumshoe: That Engarde... What was he thinking? Phoenix: You mean setting the spy camera up in the victim's room...? Gumshoe: Yeah! And it was recording at the time of the murder too, pal. Don't you find that just a tad suspicious? It doesn't sound like a coincidence to me... Pearl: ... Gumshoe: Ah! I mean, don't mind me! I didn't mean it that way, pal... Phoenix: (Then what \"way\" did you mean it?) Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: My impression of her has totally changed, pal. Phoenix: Hmm... I wonder what she is doing right now...? Gumshoe: I'm sure she's still being questioned. She sure got herself into quite a big mess trying to frame Mr. Engarde. She'll probably be spending the night at the detention center... Phoenix: (Yeah, that's right. She's still at the detention center.) After clearing all Talk options: Gumshoe: I know you don't want to give up, pal... Phoenix: (I never thought... I didn't think it was possible... The person who put the spy camera in Juan Corrida's room was Matt Engarde!) Pearl: Why... Why would Mr. Engarde do something like this!? Gumshoe: I bet it was to catch Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida in one of their rendezvous. Phoenix: \"I bet\" is not good enough for me. I have to know the absolute truth behind this camera. Gumshoe: Are you going to see him? Mr. Engarde, I mean. Phoenix: Yes. Pearl: I'm... I'm scared, Mr. Nick. I wonder... I wonder what we will find out next... Phoenix: (I'm scared myself, but I have to put on a good face for Pearls... Matt Engarde! What in the world have you done!?) Corrida's Hotel Room Present Spy Camera or Transmitter Pearl: I've learned a lot of things during this case. For example, if you want to spy on someone, there are devices like this you can use. Phoenix: Well, it's not really a device for the purpose of spying. The way any device is used is decided by the people who use them. Pearl: ... Stuffed Bear Pearl: Poor teddy... I feel bad for it. Its eye was... It was... And all for the criminal's mean plan... Phoenix: (This bear... It's an expensive luxury brand from overseas.) But it's OK, Pearls. Now it's helping us by giving us a clue... It's telling us who the real culprit is so we can get some justice. Detention Center (after clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices) Engarde: You're working really late, you know. It's already past 10:00 PM, dude. Phoenix: I think it's time you told me the truth. Engarde: ... Relax. Don't you know that \"ignorance is bliss\"? But if you really want to know, let's talk. Talk Matt's secret (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Engarde: Well done, Mr. Wright. I bet it wasn't easy to gather as much information as you have. Phoenix: You really... So you were Shelly de Killer's client!? Engarde: You don't really think I would dirty my own hands in this, do you? Pearl: Wh-What do you mean!? Engarde: And that woman... Adrian was quite brave herself. Trying to stick the crime on me -- I didn't think she had it in her. But all I care about is that Juan is dead. Isn't that right, Mister Lawyer? Pearl: Th-That's... You're lying!! What a terrible...! Engarde: It's way past your bedtime... little girl. Go on, and let us grown-ups talk about more... adult things. Pearl: But why!? Why did you hide the video camera and... Engarde: ... A weakling soon believes the words of others... just like that pathetic Adrian. Phoenix: (He knew about Ms. Andrews' secret...?) Engarde: But I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all assassins. Phoenix: What...? Engarde: Oh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail. They turn their clients into cashcows by holding the sinful deed over their heads. And a superstar like me, how much do you think I'm worth? Care to guess? Pearl: And... And that's why...? Engarde: Yes, that's where the video comes in. It's got his face and the crime scene recorded on it, preserved for all time. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want. That's right. That video is my \"insurance\"... Isn't that what they call it, Mr. Wright? Pearl: Why would you do something so wrong...? Engarde: Because I'm a grown-up, and I can. Good enough of an answer for you, little girl? Motive for murder (appears after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: Why!? Why would you kill Mr. Corrida...? Engarde: Because he was about to sling so much dung onto my beautiful public image. Scandals are a little annoying, aren't they? Phoenix: This is all because of that press conference, isn't it...? Pearl: If Mr. Corrida had been able to give it, then Mr. Engarde's secret would've... Engarde: Ah, well, that's what we call \"taking advantage of the situation\", you know? I had no interest in doing it, really, but bit by bit, it crept up on me. And then the situation just presented itself perfectly... \"How beautiful,\" I thought. Pearl: And that's... That's how Mr. Corrida ended up dead... Engarde: Let me tell you something. I'm not like Adrian. I don't depend on anyone. People are simply things to be used. Used and thrown away. Put on a sweet, innocent face, and people will swallow anything you feed them. Adrian fell for it. The assassin too. Oh, and how can I forget. Even you fell for it, Mister Lawyer! Everyone, all working their butts off for me, Matt Engarde! Pearl: ... Engarde: Aww, did that leave you speechless? What a shame. Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Matt's Secret -- Phoenix: Now, let's hear what this \"secret\" of yours is. What if Mr. Corrida had been successful in his plan? What would he have disclosed...? Engarde: I told you before, dude. I don't know! I don't know anything about Juan, OK? Look, Mr. Wright. I can keep on saying it until I'm blue in the face, but... I totally didn't pay Juan any attention the whole time that night! I mean, come on! I was in the middle of a nap! Phoenix: Don't lie to me. Engarde: Huh? Phoenix: I know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night! Present Spy Camera or Transmitter Phoenix: Phoenix: Someone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder. Engarde: ...\"Secretly film\"...? What? Phoenix: And then sent the images the camera took with this transmitter. Engarde: Wow... But dude, where was this camera you're talking about hidden? Present Stuffed Bear Phoenix: Leads to: \"The spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: Mr. Lawyer dude, I'm really tired... Phoenix: I know... Engarde: But dude, you look even more tired than me. Why don't we call it quits for today and get some sleep? How does that sound? Phoenix: What made you say that all of a sudden? Engarde: Well, you're here showing me stuff that doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: Oh, oops. (I guess I really must be tired...) But I'm not giving up just yet. Leads back to: \"Someone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder.\" Phoenix: The spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye! Engarde: ... Phoenix: A bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan! 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"...Hmph.\" Present Stuffed Bear Phoenix: This bear was in Mr. Corrida's room on the night of the murder. A bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan! Engarde: So? It's a present, dude. It actually looks kinda classy, if you know what I mean. Phoenix: Yes, I hear it's quite expensive. Which is why it is very odd that this gadget was found inside this bear! Present Spy Camera or Transmitter Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is a very small video camera.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: Mr. Lawyer dude, I'm really tired... Phoenix: I know... Engarde: But dude, you look even more tired than me. Why don't we call it quits for today and get some sleep? How does that sound? Phoenix: What made you say that all of a sudden? Engarde: Well, you're here showing me stuff that doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: Oh, oops. (I guess I really must be tired...) But I'm not giving up just yet. Leads back to: \"This bear was in Mr. Corrida's room on the night of the murder.\" Phoenix: This is a very small video camera. And it was hidden inside this bear's eye. Engarde: ...Maybe it's a really curious bear...? Phoenix: Well, whatever this \"bear\" saw was sent somewhere using this transmitter. Which means... Someone, on the night of the murder, was secretly filming Mr. Corrida's room! 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"...Hmph.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult my friend, OK? ... ... He said I should snort while I give a good laugh. Phoenix: Um... Engarde: OK, here I go. ... Aha ha ha ha *snort!* Phoenix: (I can't believe he can be so flippant at a time like this...) Um, Mr. Engarde... I don't think you need to snort while you laugh. Really. Leads back to: \"I know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night!\" Engarde: ...Hmph. I guess Juan had a few of those kinds of fans too, huh dude? Phoenix: Actually, I wouldn't say this bear was a present from a \"fan\". Engarde: ... Hmm... You sure, dude? Who else could it be from? Phoenix: The person who gave this bear to Mr. Corrida was... Present Matt Engarde profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Engarde. Don't you know this bear from somewhere...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my mom, OK? ... ... She says that I can't be friends with someone like you. Phoenix: Um... Engarde: Go home! If you don't go away, I'm gonna call the police on you! Phoenix: (...That's strange. I thought the answer was right there in front of me...) Leads back to: \"Actually, I wouldn't say this bear was a present from a \"fan\".\" Phoenix: Mr. Engarde. Don't you know this bear from somewhere...? Engarde: I don't think I've ever met Mr. Bear before, dude. Phoenix: Aww, but he says he knows you. How could you forget such a great friend? Engarde: ... What else did the bear tell you? Phoenix: He says that the one who put the camera in his eye was you, Mr. Engarde. Engarde: ... If I didn't know how you work in court, I'd think I was in some serious trouble. Come on... This is all a joke, right dude? You're just pulling my leg. Phoenix: Looks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet. Engarde: Well, do you have any proof you want to show me first? Phoenix: Here is proof that it was you who put the camera inside the bear: Present Credit Card Receipt Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, come on, Mr. Engarde! Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my grandma, OK? ... ... Did you know? It's bad to whistle at night, dude... Because snakes will come out if you do. Phoenix: Um... Engarde: My grandma, she knows all sorts of stuff. I think you'd better learn from her example, OK? Phoenix: (Is he telling me to think carefully before I speak...? Argh! So close and yet so far!) Leads back to: \"Looks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet.\" Phoenix: I have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde. It's from when YOU bought that stuffed bear! Engarde: Dude, all you can tell from this is that I spent $3,800. I go to that department store all the time, OK? This $3,800... This could be the toothbrush I bought that one time. Phoenix: A-A THIRTY-EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR TOOTHBRUSH!? Engarde: ...It's ivory... And it's got elephant hair for bristles... Phoenix: (Eww... Elephant hair? Is that what rich people use nowadays...?) Anyway! The store clerk clearly remembers you and your purchase. After all, you even gave him an autograph, did you not!? Engarde: ... Dude... You should've said that earlier. 1 LOCK BROKEN Engarde: ... Um, so can I ask you one thing? Phoenix: Yes? Engarde: You're my lawyer, right dude? So, if you are, then why are you looking into stuff like that? Phoenix: Because if I don't know the truth, I can't help you. Engarde: Sounds more like stupid lawyer talk to me... Hey, let's stop talking about this, OK? Phoenix: No, not yet. I haven't asked why you set the camera up yet. Engarde: ... Phoenix: And what your \"secret\" is. Of course, it would be strictly confidential... Engarde: So...? What are you going to do now? Phoenix: I'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must. The reason you hid this camera in Mr. Corrida's room and filmed it in secret is... Present Picture Card Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wh-What is this card...?\" Present Magazine Clipping or Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Engarde: Adrian Andrews? Phoenix: There is a rumor going around... That Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida were having secret meetings. Engarde: ... Phoenix: You, who was keeping tabs on Mr. Corrida... You were going to reveal this as fact, and turn it into a scandal. Isn't that right!? Engarde: ... ...Dude, you can be such a moron. Phoenix: Huh? Engarde: Oh man, Mr. Lawyer dude, that kind of scandal... That's the good stuff! That's what we in the industry call \"juicy\"! Phoenix: ...The \"good stuff\"...? \"Juicy\"...? Engarde: Look, we can get publicity without spending a penny with that kind of stuff. I mean, if people stopped paying attention to us, then it'd be the end, dude. Phoenix: ... Too bad that wasn't your intention. Engarde: What are you talking about? Phoenix: I wish your reason for spying was something so innocent. But it wasn't. You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews... Then there's only one reason I can think of for you to do such a thing. Engarde: ...! Phoenix: The real reason you set up that camera in Mr. Corrida's room was... Present Picture Card Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wh-What is this card...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: ...If I really wanted to set up a spy camera... I wouldn't have set it up in Juan's room. It would be in your office, dude. Phoenix: Huh? My office...? Engarde: Well, dude, you're always saying really absurd things, right? It'd be like getting the comedy channel for free! Phoenix: (Argh! I'm so close! I can feel it!) I-If you're done laughing! Leads back to: \"You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: ... ... Phoenix: Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Dude, how about you take that bear home with you and talk to it? I'm sure Mr. Bear will talk with you about as much as I will, which is not at all. Phoenix: Um... (I have to somehow get it through his head I'm not giving up.) Engarde: So, is it time to throw in the towel yet, dude? Phoenix: Sorry, but no. Leads back to: \"I'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must.\" Engarde: Wh-What is this card...? Phoenix: (Maybe he doesn't know about this card...) This is a certain man's \"calling card\"... The man's name is Shelly de Killer... and I'm sure you know of him, don't you? Engarde: Shelly... de Killer... Th-Th-That's ridiculous! Wh-Why would I know some shady scumbag like him...? Phoenix: If you really don't know him, then why are you acting so jumpy all of a sudden? Engarde: Umm! Phoenix: (This is it! I'm finally starting to get to the truth! I can't afford to make any more mistakes now...) Mr. Matt Engarde. I know why you know Mr. de Killer. It's because... you're a hero of justice. Phoenix: It's because you're the great hero of justice, the Nickel Samurai! Engarde: Duuuuude!? Phoenix: You spied on that room to do one thing and one thing only! To expose Shelly de Killer's fiendish plot! Engarde: ...I... ...Okay... If that's what you think, then whatever, dude. Phoenix: ... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry. Slip of the tongue... Leads back to: \"Mr. Matt Engarde.\" you're his client. Leads to: \"Since you're the one who set up that camera...\" you're a star. Phoenix: It's because you're a star! Engarde: Duuuuude!? What in the world are you talking about!? Phoenix: Well, you're a star. And stars never need a logical, or sane reason for anything! Engarde: ...I... ...Okay... If that's what you think, then whatever, dude. Phoenix: ... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry. Slip of the tongue... Leads back to: \"Mr. Matt Engarde.\" Phoenix: Since you're the one who set up that camera... That means you knew... You knew exactly what was going to happen in that room! Engarde: ... Phoenix: So... How? How would you know something like that...? It's because you're his client. That's why. You hired Shelly de Killer to assassinate Mr. Juan Corrida! The real mastermind behind this whole murder is... You, Matt Engarde! Engarde: ... ... ... ...*sigh* And here I was, trying to be a good boy for you, dude. Phoenix: ...! Engarde: I thought if you didn't know, you'd be able to do your job without feeling bad. Well, that's what I thought, anyway... Phoenix: M-Mr. Engarde... You really did hire...!? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult myself, OK? ... ... Phoenix: (Consult... \"myself\"...??) Engarde: ...Well, I guess it's probably about time anyway. Phoenix: About time for what? Engarde: I think it's time for you to meet him now, Mr. Lawyer dude. 3 LOCKS BROKEN Engarde: How do you do... Mister Lawyer? I'm Matt Engarde. Unlock Successful Anything (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Engarde: I don't care what you show... I think you've gotten enough out of me, don't you? Enough freebies for today. The rest is up to you, isn't that right... Mister Lawyer? After breaking Matt Enguarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Engarde: What's wrong, Mister Lawyer? You've grown awfully quiet... Phoenix: H-How could I have been so deceived by you all this time? When we first met, I asked if you had killed Juan Corrida... And you answered very clearly that you hadn't killed anyone. Engarde: Hey now. I never told you any lies. The person who did the killing was that De Killer guy, right? All I'm guilty of is taking a catnap in my room. Phoenix: You... You... You killed Mr. Corrida! Engarde: Hahaha. I dare you to say that in court tomorrow. Phoenix: Grr... Engarde: Aww, but too bad. You can't. You're my lawyer, after all. Aren't you? Phoenix: ... Engarde: You could always drop my case and refuse to represent me. How does that sound? Aww, but you can't, can you? That would be the one thing you absolutely can't do. Pearl: M-Mystic Maya...! Engarde: You wouldn't want to test De Killer. He's a man of his word, or so I hear. You could end up getting a certain friend of yours rubbed out if you lose. Phoenix: ...Y...You... scoundrel... Engarde: So if I were you, Mr. Wright, esquire, I think I would give it my all tomorrow. Remember, everyone likes a happy win-win resolution. Phoenix: I... I'll get you for this! Engarde: That's such a clich\u00e9 phrase. Juan said something just like that, if memory serves. Of course... Well, we all know how well things turned out for him, don't we? Good night, Mister Lawyer. Phoenix: (Maya... Maya, what am I supposed to do!?) ???: ... And now... Now you've finally found it. Edgeworth: The starting line of this case. Phoenix: Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I don't care for the horrid atmosphere here. Let's return to the precinct. March 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Edgeworth: Well, Wright? What are you going to do? If you plan on changing your defense... Pearl: N...No! We can't do that... Edgeworth: That's right... He's holding Maya hostage... Phoenix: ... What... What should I do...? Edgeworth: ... That's not something I can answer for you. Pearl: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Wright... Only you can decide where to go from here. One year ago... At that time, I didn't truly understand what a \"prosecutor\" was. And that is why... I had to leave the Prosecutor's Office. I felt that I couldn't stand in a court of law until I knew what a prosecutor really was. And now, Wright... It's your turn. Phoenix: My... turn? Edgeworth: What is this thing called a \"lawyer\"? What can you do as one? You must find the answer... And you must find it on your own. Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: I'm a lawyer... But to fight for someone who is clearly a killer... Matt Engarde... That man is really... Argh! Edgeworth: It doesn't matter who, every person deserves a proper defense and a fair trial. Isn't that the basis of our judicial system? Phoenix: \"Proper defense\"? But what exactly is that? Is it where a lawyer forcibly and blindly gets an acquittal through shouting and trickery? Edgeworth: ...*sigh* Ironic that you of all people should say such a thing. Isn't that exactly how you have fought for your clients up until now? Phoenix: Uh... W-Well, that may be true, but... But that's... That's because I've believed my clients to be innocent from the bottom of my heart! But if I were to get Engarde an acquittal... That... That isn't a proper defense at all! Maya's situation Phoenix: I became a lawyer because I thought... I thought I could save people who were suffering and in pain... Pearl: ... Phoenix: But... When I look at this mess we're in... I can't even protect the person closest to me. Even if I win the case, I still lose in the end... I just don't know what to do! Edgeworth: ... Wright. Would you get a hold of yourself? You have it all wrong. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: We aren't some sort of heroes. We're only human, you and I. You want to \"save someone\"? That's something easier said than done, wouldn't you say? Pearl: Th-That's... Edgeworth: You are a defense lawyer. You can't run away from that. You can only fight. That's all you can do. Why fight? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Maya's situation\") Leads to: \"People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down.\" Present Anything Phoenix: (Now's not the time to talk about evidence...) Phoenix: People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down. You fight to the very end, even when you know the truth is not with you. But I'm not like you. I can't fight for a false verdict -- for a man I clearly know to be guilty! Edgeworth: ... Franziska... She fights for herself. The only thing she fights for is her perfect win record. That's all. Phoenix: And!? Isn't that the same as you!? Isn't that why you ran away a year ago? Because your precious win record was destroyed!? You are so petty! Edgeworth: ... I see... Now I understand why you despise me so. However, you are mistaken. Phoenix: What do you...? Edgeworth: Thanks to you, when you sealed off my path to a perfect win record... I began to realize the error of my ways. I realized that things such as a perfect record were meaningless. Pearl: What!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release) Phoenix: I don't believe you. Are you saying that is why you left the Prosecutor's Office? But then, why? Why are you here now? Edgeworth: The answer to that... is something you will find out on your own. I have faith you will see it before the verdict is read tomorrow. But if you can't, then you will be powerless to change the ending of this story. ...*beep beep beep*... Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! The transceiver! ...*beep*... ???: I'm sorry for what happened earlier. Well then, Mr. Attorney. Do you wager you can obtain an acquittal tomorrow? Phoenix: ... ???: My, my. What is the matter, Mr. Attorney? I don't sense your usual anger this time. Phoenix: ...Tell me. Please. Why are you holding Maya hostage for Mr. Engarde's sake? Why are you... Why are you doing this for that cold-blooded killer!? Edgeworth: Wright... ???: ... Please don't misunderstand things. He is my client. Phoenix: Don't toy with me! A man who hires an assassin is just as much of a killer himself! ???: ... ...I believe you were asking me for a reason as to why I am doing what I am... Phoenix: ...Y-Yeah. ???: This is what I like to call my \"aftercare\". Phoenix: Wh-What the heck is \"aftercare\"? ???: My name carries a certain amount of honor and dignity, Mr. Attorney. I take great care to insure that no suspicion falls upon my clients for my handiwork. That is what is called \"client relations\" and it is a part of an assassin's duty. Phoenix: An assassin's... \"duty\"...? ???: We were unlucky this time and my client was arrested as a suspect. As a result, I did what I had to do to enlist your expert help, Mr. Attorney. And to ensure that you would do everything in your power to the very end. Phoenix: Wh-What is your name!? ???: I believe I told you once before, however... Phoenix: You did... But... ???: My name is... De Killer. Shelly de Killer. Edgeworth: Y-You're Shelly de Killer!? de Killer: Please keep in mind you do not have much space to maneuver with me. As a De Killer, I always finish what I set out to do. If you fail to keep up your end of the bargain... Phoenix: M-Maya! de Killer: It would be my duty as an assassin to see to it she receives a nice long nap. Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaaah! Noooooooooooo! de Killer: Now then, if you'll excuse me. If someone were to trace this signal back to me, it would be quite troublesome. ...Meow. ...*beep*... Pearl: Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaa! Edgeworth: I... I don't know what to say... Phoenix: ...Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hm? Phoenix: Did you hear that? At the end of that transmission... ...Meow. Edgeworth: Huh? Oh, that... It sounded like a cat. Pearl: ...A cat? Phoenix: (It can't be... that cat... Can it...?) Pearl: What is it...? Phoenix: I think... I know where Shelly de Killer is holding Maya hostage! Edgeworth! Have all police units head for Engarde Mansion immediately! Edgeworth: ...! Alright. You hurry over as well, then! Phoenix: Don't lose hope yet, Pearls! The fight has only just begun! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Detention Center (after breaking Matt Engarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: (Now then, whose story do I want to hear?) Matt Engarde Jailer: I'm really sorry, but... Matt Engarde is refusing to meet with you. Phoenix: ...I see. Phoenix: (Well, I guess I don't really have anything left to talk to him about anyway...) Pearl: Shall we listen to what Ms. Andrews has to say...? March 22Engarde MansionLiving Room Phoenix: Maya! Pearl: Please answer us! Mystic Mayaaaa! Edgeworth: We have this area completely surrounded. There is no way for him to escape. Assuming he's still in the area... Phoenix: I can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer... Edgeworth: He and Engarde were working together all this time. I'm sure they had worked out a contingency plan ahead of time. Examine Fireplace Phoenix: This is the first time I've seen such a large fireplace. Edgeworth: I don't particularly care for large fireplaces. They remind me of my youth. Phoenix: (I wonder, if memory serves, if it's because of that rich aunt he had?) Don't tell me you're still stuck on that incident...? Edgeworth: Don't take this personally, but I really do not wish to remember anything from that time in my life. Motorcycle Edgeworth: It seems that Engarde was quite famous, even as a motorcycle racer. Phoenix: Generally when a star like him tries to do something like that, they fail, but... Edgeworth: It seems Engarde is no ordinary man. Lounge set Edgeworth: That Engarde... This is probably where he conducted business with De Killer. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: Shelly de Killer values his client relations more than anything else. So I'm sure he must meet with his clients in person to talk about any transactions. Masks Edgeworth: It's Engarde's personal collection. I'd say it's a hobby of his to collect prop masks of shows related to his own. Phoenix: You seem to know all sorts of details about Matt Engarde... Almost too many details... Edgeworth: He's the defendant in this case. Of course I would know about him. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... I guess that makes sense... Doorway behind railing Phoenix: It looks like there's another room in the back. Edgeworth: Leave that to us. I'm sure the investigation team is already doing its job in there. Door Pearl: There's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: I bet it's for the cat to use. Pearl: Oh, you mean Shoe. Bear figurine Leads to: \"Oh, it's a figurine of a bear!\" Pearl: Oh, it's a figurine of a bear! But there are a lot of cuts in it for some reason... Figurine added to the Court Record. Phoenix: A bear...? Isn't that more of a thing for Mr. Corrida? Why would something like this be here...? Edgeworth: Wright, look down. There's a little pet door installed here. Pearl: Ah, I'm sure that's for Shoe... Phoenix: Do you think that this... came through that little door...? Edgeworth: Umph! This door... It's locked! Phoenix: Well, I'm pretty used to breaking doors down by now. Let's go, Edgeworth! *SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!* Private Lounge Phoenix: Argh! There's no one here! Edgeworth: From the looks of this room, I would say this is Engarde's private lounge. ...Look at this, Wright! Phoenix: An antennae for sending and receiving radio signals and a VCR... Check inside the deck! If there's a tape, it would be an important piece of evidence! (If we're lucky, it'll have the moment the crime was committed recorded on it!) Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but... The tape deck is empty. There's no tape to be found. Pearl: No... Edgeworth: But there's no mistake that someone used this to record something. It looks like someone took the tape we're looking for, and escaped with it... Examine TV Phoenix: A huge television and speakers loom largely here. I'm sure if Maya saw this, she'd say, Maya: \"I would die a happy Samurai fan if I could see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this!\" Phoenix: Yeah, that's what she'd say... ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about Maya, all things considered... Satellite dish Phoenix: It's a VCR and an antennae. The footage that the spy camera took at the scene of the crime... was beamed here and recorded on tape. Pearl: If only we had that tape, it would have been really helpful... Computer Phoenix: It's Engarde's computer. Maya... Why couldn't you have used this to get help? Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! Where's... Where's the power switch!? Phoenix: ... (Oh, I get it... So that's what happened. She couldn't find the power switch...) Table Phoenix: It's a very small table. I bet we could barely squeeze 3 Pearls on there. Pearl: But I wouldn't sit on a table to begin with, Mr. Nick... Sofa Phoenix: What a spacious sofa. I bet 10 Pearls would fit on here. Pearl: Um, I don't think 10 of me would fit, Mr. Nick... Video tapes Phoenix: I can't read all the labels, but this is a very large collection of video tapes. Looks like Engarde taped all of his own shows... Door Pearl: There's a little door for Shoe in this big door. Phoenix: I'm sure Maya used this door to shove this out there... I'm sure it was her! (Every time you give me some piece of evidence, it's always the most crucial piece. This time too, I'm sure...) Wine Cellar Phoenix: ... (We've searched all over, but it looks like he got away...) Edgeworth: I'm sorry. It looks like he slipped out of our grasp this time. Phoenix: And now... we've lost our only lead. Edgeworth: Don't give up yet. That little girl is looking to you to be her pillar. Pearl: ... Phoenix: ...Yeah, you're right. Edgeworth: We're close, I can tell. We've already set up checkpoints along every route leading out of this district. Leave the rest to us. Phoenix: (Maya...) Examine Bottles Pearl: Wow... I've never seen so many bottles all in one place before. Phoenix: Well, I guess when you're a star, you have so much money you can buy anything you want. Boxes Phoenix: The light doesn't filter in all the way, so it's hard to see. It looks like there are crates and cardboard boxes tied up with wire here. Door Pearl: It's a pretty heavy door, isn't it? I can't open it by myself. Please don't shut me in here by accident, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (If I were locked in a place like this... I'd be plenty scared too. Trust me.) Photo frame Leads to: \"This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax...\" Phoenix: This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax... (\"With love... Celeste\") Pearl: Ms. Inpax? You mean...? Phoenix: Yes, Mr. Corrida's former manager. Pearl: Why would a picture of Ms. Inpax be here in Mr. Engarde's mansion? Phoenix: (And why does it say, \"With love\"...? Hmm, this might be a clue...) Celeste's Photo added to the Court Record. Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: What's wrong, Pearls? Pearl: P-Please let me see that picture frame! Phoenix: (Huh? What's so special about the frame?) Pearl: On the back... There's something written on the back of the frame! ...\"Maya\" It's Mystic Maya! She left us a message! Phoenix: Wh-What!? Maya: I thought you'd come. I knew you would. Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever! I'm fine, so you don't need to worry. ...There's so much I want to write, but I don't think I have a lot of time left. Pearly, you're there too, right? Make sure you help Nick, OK? Someone's gotta watch out for the helpless lunk. ... Um... That's it for now, Nick. I guess I'll talk to you guys later. Pearl: ...That's... I... Nooooooooo! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa... *sob* Edgeworth: Wright! Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: What's wrong? Why the blank stare? Phoenix: Oh, um, nothing. Edgeworth: We've searched the house, and this is the last room. It looks like he eluded us. Phoenix: ...Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Yes? Phoenix: As far as clues go, I think this is about all I'm going to get. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: But I'm still short one last thing... Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews' Psyche-Lock... If I could just find out what secret she's holding... Then I think I stand a chance in court tomorrow... To blow this case wide open and expose the truth.) Edgeworth: I think I know what you're thinking. I'll contact the detention center. Phoenix: Um... Thanks, Edgeworth. Well, let's go Pearls. It's time to open that last lock. March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Andrews: Good evening, Mr. Wright. ... What's wrong? You look ill... Phoenix: Ms. Andrews. I have come to remove your Psyche-Lock. Andrews: Psyche-Lock...? Phoenix: I want to know, and you will tell me... ...your secret. Andrews: Fine, go ahead. Try to break me, if you can. Talk Why frame him? (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Andrews: Celeste... She was supposed to get married to Juan. Phoenix: Yes... But I heard that it didn't work out. Pearl: Because Mr. Corrida didn't want to get married to her anymore, right...? Andrews: Yes... Because of Matt. Pearl: B-Because of Mr. Engarde? What do you mean? Phoenix: (I think I can see where this is going.) Andrews: Celeste... She was Matt's manager a long time ago. She was the happiest woman in the world at that time. I was working part-time back then, and I often saw the two of them together. Phoenix: So that's why... \"With love... Celeste\" is written on the frame of that picture. Pearl: They were a couple, weren't they? Andrews: It wasn't anything as splendid as that. Celeste was being used; toyed with until she was... thrown away. Pearl: That's so horrible... Andrews: Matt's entire image is built around how nice and wonderful of a man he is. A scandal would have destroyed that. Which is why Celeste, in her kindness, moved over to Worldwide Studios. And that is where she met Juan. She seemed really happy with him; even happier than when she was with Matt. Celeste and Juan were such a good match that they were even planning to get married. And then it was suddenly called off. On the night Juan called their marriage off, Celeste... She killed herself. And that's why I framed Matt. It was revenge for Celeste and for myself. Revenge (appears after \"Why frame him?\") Leads to: \"I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right?\" Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- Why Frame Him? -- Phoenix: Can you please tell me why you framed Mr. Engarde for the murder? Andrews: I've already told you countless times. It's because I thought Matt was the killer. Phoenix: (No, that's not it! I know you have a personal reason to dislike Mr. Engarde.) Ms. Andrews. You may think I didn't hear it, but I know you said something earlier. You said, \"Revenge.\" Andrews: So you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why? Wh-What an absurd idea. I... I don't have anything I want to take revenge for. Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews... A woman who lives by being dependent on other people...) (Changed from [Ms. Andrews...

Present Suicide Report or Celeste Inpax profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"C-Celeste...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: Are you trying to help or hurt Matt with what you're doing...? Phoenix: What? What am I doing? Andrews: This random, haphazard throwing out of evidence you're so fond of doing. Phoenix: Th-That's not what I was trying to do at all! Andrews: Then refrain from doing it anymore. Phoenix: (I guess I screwed up big again...) Leads back to: \"So you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why?\" Andrews: C-Celeste... Phoenix: There is only one catalyst that could cause such strong feelings, and even revenge. And that is Ms. Inpax's suicide. Andrews: Wh-What are you trying to say? Celeste was Juan's manager. Phoenix: ... Andrews: On top of that, the one who hid her suicide note was also Juan. What does all this have to do with Matt? Phoenix: You're right. You haven't mentioned him... Yet. But for you to hate Mr. Engarde... It would mean that he must have had some relation to Ms. Inpax and her suicide. Andrews: Can you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!? Present Celeste's Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: That's it? Phoenix: Yes... Andrews: And what sort of relation is this supposed to explain? Phoenix: W-Well, Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde's... Andrews: Before you start, Mr. Wright, perhaps I should first request to see proof that your brain is wired correctly. Phoenix: (Argh. I can't afford to mess up something as big as this! I need evidence that clearly shows a connection between Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde. If I can find that, I can finally get the real story!) Andrews: I wonder if you'd like to try again, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"Can you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!?\" Phoenix: This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct? She looks younger than when she passed away though. Andrews: ...W... Phoenix: \"With love... Celeste\". This is Ms. Inpax's handwriting, isn't it? Andrews: ... Where did you find this...? No, that's alright. It was a rhetorical question... Phoenix: Yeah, it is. I found this at Mr. Engarde's mansion. Andrews: ... ...And after all this time... My last remaining secret has been revealed... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Andrews: I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right? Matt \"confessed\" to Juan... about his relationship with Celeste. Phoenix: I see... So that's what happened. Pearl: But... Then why did Mr. Corrida have to call off the wedding!? I don't understand at all... Andrews: It was probably because of his worthless male pride. Juan and Matt were always fierce rivals. Matt waited for the wedding announcement and then unleashed the truth on Juan. He was aiming for when it would hurt Juan the most. Pearl: Poor Ms. Inpax! Andrews: ...That wasn't the end of it. That day, I'm almost certain that Celeste left a suicide note behind. And in that note, she left a detailed account of Matt's various misdeeds, and... So that she would never again be hurt by Matt, she chose... to die. Then, when Juan discovered her body, he hid her note. Pearl: B-But why would he do that!? Andrews: It's simple. Juan realized that note was a powerful weapon against Matt. And it would be especially damaging to his \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image. In any case... With his pride hurt, Juan sought revenge. Phoenix: Revenge... There's that word again. Andrews: Juan wanted to publicly disclose the contents of that suicide note. At a time that would cause Matt the most damage, of course. Phoenix: And that was at the press conference after the stage show... Andrews: I know all about it, because I heard it all from Juan. It was so I could find out about all this that I drew close to Juan to begin with. They're quite a pair of hideous monsters, aren't they? Even Celeste's death was something for them to use in their game. That night, when I found Juan's body, it was only natural that I thought the murderer was Matt. Those two were always spying on one another, after all. As for me, I was frantically searching for Celeste's suicide note. I wanted to destroy it before it ever went public. I was going to burn it. I had even brought a lighter. But... I couldn't find the suicide note... And that's when revenge crossed my mind. Yes, I was going to bring to them my own kind of cruel revenge. Celeste was killed by those two monsters. So when I stabbed Juan's body with that knife... I didn't feel a single shred of guilt. Pearl: ...! Andrews: ... And that's all I have to say. Phoenix: ... Andrews: Well, Mr. Wright? Even knowing all this, are you still going to help that... \"man\"? Phoenix: ... I... I'm a lawyer... Andrews: I see. What a foul profession. Phoenix: ... Thank you very much for your time and for talking with me. Andrews: It was no big deal. I couldn't sleep anyway. Phoenix: (I can't sleep either... Not with Maya's situation... or with what I know now...) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Maya Fey) Maya: I can't see very well in this darkness, but it doesn't seem like there's anything there... Nothing to examine during bug sweeping session Pearl: There doesn't seem to be anything giving off radio waves there, Mr. Nick. Keep a careful eye on the bug sweeper and let's try again! (Changed from [Keep a careful eye on the CHECK gauge, and let's try again!] in the original release) Phoenix: (This sweeper isn't exactly the best... Well, make do with what you have, right?) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- About My Client --de Killer: There is something I must first state.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: We can hear anything you have to say later. Can you please just tell us your client's...? de Killer: I don't think you understand your place, Mr. Attorney. I said this is something I must first state. Do you know what the word \"first\" means? Phoenix: ... S-Sorry... Go on... Judge: Well, it appears this is one witness you can't badger, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (That's only because you don't know about Maya's situation...)de Killer: To an assassin, nothing is more important than the trust between a client and himself.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The trust between you and your client...? de Killer: I provide my services in a fast and efficient manner. In exchange, I trust that my clients are discreet about me and my identity. If too many people knew my face, it would be quite troublesome. Judge: And that is why you're testifying in this manner? de Killer: This is the first time one of my clients has ever been accused of murder. I must preserve the De Killer name so my clients can trust me. Phoenix: But couldn't someone stab you in the back and break your trust? de Killer: It has never happened before, but if it ever did... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? de Killer: That person wouldn't be my client for very long. They would certainly... Judge: Th-That's enough! Please, no more! de Killer: Very well. It was only a hypothetical anyway.Press (after pressing this statement, then pressing third statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: The trust between you and your client...? de Killer: I provide my services in a fast and efficient manner. In exchange, I trust that my clients are discreet about me and my identity. These are the roles and duties an assassin and his client are to carry out. Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I was wondering about something you just said. You said that your client had already \"broken the rules\"... de Killer: A person who frames another is the worst kind of human. Phoenix: And that's why you feel you can betray this person? de Killer: I have no trust relation with a client who can't understand their assigned role. Phoenix: (Just my luck... An assassin with a conscience. Who would've figured...?) de Killer: Now then, everyone. Do you think you can understand my logic? Phoenix: (This case just keeps getting better and better!) de Killer: If you can't, then I'm afraid we can't proceed... Phoenix: Everyone understands your point, I think. Really. de Killer: In that case... I believe I am prepared to disclose the information you seek. Edgeworth: You have made it crystal clear that you value trust over all else. I believe we are ready. de Killer: ...Excellent. Changes statement from \"It is my wish that you grasp this concept before I give the name of my client.\" to \"Now then, I do believe it's about time I revealed the name of my client, don't you agree?\"de Killer: And that is the reason I am here today on this witness stand.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That seems a little strange to me... I mean, you're about to tell us the name of your client. I would think that this would be very bad for them. de Killer: It doesn't matter to me. This client has already broken the rules and acted outside of their prescribed role. Judge: Their role...? de Killer: This person tried to implicate another of the crime in order to save themselves. And this is a trespass that cannot be forgiven. Judge: You... Who gave you the right to be so high and mighty...!? de Killer: To the gentleman who spoke just now... Excuse me, but would you care to die? Judge: Ah, no! No! I, uh, didn't say anything! Phoenix: (The judge had better watch himself...)de Killer: It is my wish that you grasp this concept before I give the name of my client.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: We understand, so please tell us the name of your client!! de Killer: I'm afraid I cannot do that. I still have a few things to say before I do. Phoenix: (Aaargh! That egomaniacal...) de Killer: It's not good for your health to be so aggravated. You won't live very long if you let everything bother you... Phoenix: (Somehow, that coming from an assassin makes it less than comforting...)de Killer: Now then, I do believe it's about time I revealed the name of my client, don't you agree?Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"...\"Phoenix: (I don't really care about all this extra fluff. Just tell us the name already!)Mia: Patience. Try to calm down a little. It's important to try and understand his mindset. He seems very steadfast and closed so you're going to have to work to get him to talk.Phoenix: (I'm not his therapist, you know...)Phoenix: ...Judge: What is it?Phoenix: (Umm... Now I can't bring myself to ask the client's name...)Edgeworth: If you can't ask it, Mr. Wright, then I will. Witness! What is the name of your client who requested the murder of Mr. Juan Corrida!?de Killer: That person's name is...Phoenix: ...Edgeworth: ...Judge: ...de Killer: ...Adrian Andrews...Phoenix: WhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaEdgeworth: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaJudge: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: W-Witness!! That's not who you told me it was earlier!Phoenix: ...!de Killer: Pray tell, what are you talking about, Mr. Prosecutor? I should think I know my own client, and it is Adrian Andrews.Edgeworth: Whaaaaaaaat!?!? Th-This can't be! On the phone earlier...Phoenix: Wh-What's going on here...?Mia: My guess is that Mr. de Killer just stabbed Mr. Edgeworth in the back.Phoenix: Stabbed Edgeworth in the back...?Mia: I'm sure in order to get an audience with this court, Mr. de Killer told him a different name... \"Matt Engarde\", perhaps...?Phoenix: (I knew it...)Edgeworth:Edgeworth: This... This is outrageous! I was deceived! This witness is telling a very serious lie!Judge: B-But you were the one who summoned this witness!Edgeworth: Grk! Grr... Y-You... Shelly de Killer...!de Killer: My testimony is the truth. The defendant at the moment is Matt Engarde, am I correct? All I wish to do is help procure his acquittal.Judge: H... Hmm...Mia: Wow... All of a sudden, it feels like we can actually win this.Phoenix: Yeah...Judge: The prosecution has failed to provide a motive and has instead, provided this suicide note, which is a forgery created by the victim. Furthermore, there is a possibility the defendant himself knew it was a fake. But most definitive of all, we have heard from the assassin himself; the name of his client. Mr. de Killer's client who requested the murder was not the defendant at all!Edgeworth: ...No...Judge: With all this evidence, it is obvious to me that this means that Mr. Matt Engarde... Is innocent!de Killer: I seem to have caused you all a bit of confusion. Please, continue your discussion, and call me when you have reached a verdict....*beep*...Judge: Bailiff! Please bring Ms. Adrian Andrews in immediately!Mia: What now? With the way this is going, Engarde will be found innocent. This may be our last chance... to save Maya...Phoenix: Yeah... But... But Edgeworth is right. De Killer is lying! And Engarde... my client... I know he's guilty! (Can I live with myself if I win this!?)Judge: Who would've believed that the prosecution's own witness would absolve the defendant!?Edgeworth: Your Honor! The prosecution requests permission to further question the witness! Shelly de Killer is certainly lying under oath!Judge: Hmm...Andrews: It wasn't me! Listen! Everyone! Please! That testimony just now... It was all one big lie!Phoenix: Ms. Andrews...Andrews: The suicide note may have been a fake. But! That man... Matt... He's the reason Celeste died! And Juan's death... It was all because he got pulled into Matt's twisted world! That testimony just now... You have to believe me... It was a horrible, horrible lie...Edgeworth: ...Judge: But... Mr. de Killer himself has testified... He has named you as his client.Andrews: No! That's not true!Judge: Also, there is quite a bit of evidence that points to you. The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai costume... (Changed from [The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai's costume...] in the original release)Andrews: But that's... That's...Judge: You even have a motive. We know that Ms. Celeste Inpax was a large part of your life. You wanted to follow her... And you wanted revenge against the two who hurt her. I would say you have plenty of reasons to want them both dead.Andrews: I... No... Mr. Wright!Phoenix: ...!Andrews: You... You know the truth! Tell them! Tell them the real story... Who the real killer is... Tell them! Please... Help me...Phoenix: (Yes, I know the truth...)Judge: Mr. Wright.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor?Judge: I believe we have reached the end of this trial. Therefore, I ask the defense for any final words or opinions.Phoenix: ... (I have to decide... Do I take the not guilty verdict and save Maya... Or do I throw this chance away and wait for Gumshoe's new evidence...? What am I supposed to do!?)Request the verdict Phoenix: Your Honor! The defense will make a request... ... ... (It's no use... I can't... It feels like I've lost my voice...!) Leads to: \"Phoenix...\"Request the trial continue Leads to: \"Phoenix...\"Mia: Phoenix...Phoenix: I can't do it, Mia... I can't accept a not guilty.Mia: You are a lawyer.Phoenix: I know. But... But Matt Engarde is a killer -- a murderer! I can't... I can't let him get away with this. I can't let someone else take the fall. If I let Ms. Andrews be convicted, then I am no better than Engarde. And even though I don't want to admit it, I have to face the fact that it is because of Edgeworth that I now know the real truth. He could've gotten Engarde convicted so many times over, but he never took a single one of those chances. If I take this verdict right now... I'd be betraying his trust. (...His trust...? I never thought about it until now... I... I trust him...?)Mia: ... Yes, you do.Judge: Mr. Wright.

Please re-establish connection with Mr. de Killer.Edgeworth: Right away, Your Honor!de Killer: ...Has a verdict been reached?Edgeworth: Before that, we would like to talk with you a little more.de Killer: About? All you needed from me was the name of my client. What else could you need me for?Edgeworth: Well... Actually, we would like to hear everything you know about this case. This is how things are... usually done.Phoenix: (What is he talking about? \"Usually done\"...??)Judge: But... What shall we have him testify about now?Edgeworth: Mr. de Killer. If you don't mind, please testify about your client in more detail.de Killer: You legal people and your procedures. Is it any wonder no one likes to go to court?Witness Testimony-- About My Client, Pt. 2 --de Killer: As I have already stated quite a few times, Adrian Andrews is my client. However. One thing I simply cannot overlook is tampering with the scene of the crime. My client did it to frame another for the crime. While pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene, Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead! But even more appalling is the creation and planting of the \"knife\" and \"button\". That act is what I was referring to when I said my client had \"broken the rules\".Judge: Hmm... This is a most unexpected turn of events... For the... um, fifth time now...? However, this time, everything has finally been revealed.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Just a second, Your Honor!Judge: Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: We still have the cross-examination to do...Judge: But you don't need to question testimony like this... Do you, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: ... Your Honor, the defense will question the witness. (As if I have a choice here!)Judge: Huh!? Why!? What this witness has said is nothing but beneficial to the defense's case! If you scrutinize the testimony, then...Phoenix: (...Then I'll expose the lies in that oh-so-\"beneficial\" testimony, I suppose.)Judge: I don't understand what's going on anymore...Phoenix: (That makes two of us...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- About My Client, Pt. 2 --de Killer: As I have already stated quite a few times, Adrian Andrews is my client. However.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ... Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (If I press him the wrong way, it might raise suspicions on his end... But I have to do something to waste more time...) Um... Witness. About requesting a hit... de Killer: Yes? Phoenix: How much is your fee...? de Killer: ... I see you are also quite a dark-hearted man, Mr. Attorney... Phoenix: Huh? de Killer: If you would like to talk business, we can do so after the trial... Phoenix: Ack! NONONO! I'm not thinking of hiring-- Judge: M-M-Mr. Wright!! Phoenix: Y-Yes!? Judge: Y-Y-You... You want to kill me... You want me dead... DON'T YOU!?!? Phoenix: Whaaaat!? Why would you think something like that, Your Hon-- Judge: Guilty! MR. PHOENIX WRIGHT! You are hereby declared GUILTY!! Edgeworth: ...Witness. Let's continue... Why did you disclose the name of your client? They are your client, are they not?de Killer: One thing I simply cannot overlook is tampering with the scene of the crime.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I would think that most people wouldn't be able to overlook a person hiring another to kill. de Killer: ... If I had a problem with such a thing, I wouldn't be very effective at my job. Phoenix: Ah... Yeah... (Well, a change in occupation might be good for you...) de Killer: However, I will say this. Even though I am the one that does the deed, my clients are always the real guilty party. Edgeworth: That goes without saying, Mr. de Killer. de Killer: And their fate is to live with the knowledge of their guilt on their shoulders. However, my client this time thought that they could run away from their guilt...de Killer: My client did it to frame another for the crime.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you talking about the button and the knife? de Killer: Yes, and my business card. Phoenix: (Oh, this card...) de Killer: So that no one has to waste their time, including the police... I always make it a point to make things as easy as possible. Judge: You try to make things easy...? de Killer: My business card makes it very easy to identify who carried out the \"service\". Phoenix: (He's pretty devoted to his work...) de Killer: But to disregard everything... to go and stab the deceased with a knife, and even hide my card from sight... That is something I cannot overlook. Phoenix: (Hmm... It's really hard to tell if he's being truthful or not without him being here...)de Killer: While pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene,Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're saying most clients wouldn't do such a thing? de Killer: That is correct. Usually, most people try to create an alibi for themselves. If you should use my services, Mr. Attorney, I would suggest you plan for your alibi too... Phoenix: Ah, no! I already told you! I have no intention of ever using your services! Judge: ... Phoenix: (Why does he keep looking at me like I'm the one on trial here!?)de Killer: Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: From the very beginning? de Killer: That is correct. From before my client visited the room. All of my clients know precisely what the situation is at all times. Phoenix: (I wonder if that's really true...) Edgeworth: That's odd... Phoenix: ...?Present Wine Glass Phoenix: Leads to: \"Thank you so much for taking the time to testify, Mr. de Killer.\"de Killer: But even more appalling is the creation and planting of the \"knife\" and \"button\".Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So why do you think your client did that? de Killer: What do you mean by \"why\"? Phoenix: Well, fiddling around at the scene of the crime is pretty risky. And why would someone who has requested a murder go to the crime scene anyway? Judge: Hmm, that is true. de Killer: I assume it was probably done to frame Mr. Engarde. Phoenix: If that's the case, then why didn't the person just request that you do it...? de Killer: Sadly, that is not possible. Phoenix: Huh? de Killer: My job is to kill. That is all. And to leave my business card behind, naturally. The business card is so my clients may escape blame. To protect them is my duty. Judge: Hmm... de Killer: Even if they say it's for revenge, setting someone else up to take your fall...de Killer: That act is what I was referring to when I said my client had \"broken the rules\".Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And that's all you have to testify? de Killer: Yes. And I pray that I will never be called to the stand again... Phoenix: \"Again\"...? As in you plan to continue? de Killer: I must, as I have yet to find a person to take my place, and become the fourth successor. Actually, how would you like a new life, Mr. Attorney...? Phoenix: Excuse me? Ah, no no no! I'm fine! Really! Judge: ... Are you really now...? Phoenix: (I wonder what kind of man the judge thinks I am now...)Mia: What are you going to do now, Phoenix?Phoenix: All I can do now is expose the lies.Mia: That's true... However, you realize that will be very bad for our client, right?Phoenix: (Nnngh... I'm so confused...

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The testimony is from Shelly de Killer, and he's claiming that Adrian Andrews is his client. He says that Andrews knew Juan was dead before entering the room, which contradicts something.\n\nLooking at the evidence, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has Andrews' fingerprints. The testimony says she knew he was dead before entering, but the wine glass was poured for him, implying she thought he was alive when she poured the juice. If she knew he was dead beforehand, why pour the juice? That's a contradiction. So the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) contradicts Testimony 4 where de Killer says Andrews knew Corrida was dead from the beginning."

Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...? Mia: Nice job, Phoenix. Phoenix: Well, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later! Judge: Hmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: W-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!? Judge: Hmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...? It was stolen from Engarde. Phoenix: I think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde... Judge: S-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!? Phoenix: Maybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: And so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Maybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court! Phoenix: E-EXCUSE ME!? Edgeworth: Mr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!? Phoenix: ... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he? Judge: *sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\" It was a spare costume. Leads to: \"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\" Phoenix: Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one. Edgeworth: What...? Judge: Then... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!? Phoenix: Yes, that is what I am saying. Judge: And how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...? Edgeworth: It would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release) Judge: But... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act? Phoenix: ... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!? Phoenix: Huh!? N-No, I just... Judge: Mr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!? Mia: Phoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you! Phoenix: Alright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was... Present Press Conference Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"What is this...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!? Phoenix: I... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said! Mia: I told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"! Phoenix: *gulp* Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Ah, sorry... Mia: This one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it! Judge: Now then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time? Leads back to: \"Alright. This is what I think.\" Judge: What is this...? Phoenix: On the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference. Judge: A press conference...? Phoenix: Yes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference. Edgeworth: I heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright. Phoenix: But what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night. Andrews: ... Judge: But how can that be!? Phoenix: The way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself! Judge: Th-The victim? Phoenix: Yes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"! Judge: He was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!? Phoenix: That's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference. Edgeworth: The Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\". Phoenix: Which means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde! Judge: Yes, I guess that is what it would mean... Edgeworth: But, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"! Andrews: Hmph. Judge: M-Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: I can see why you are pros at what you do. Judge: Pardon me? Andrews: Yes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan. Judge: Ms. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this! Andrews: I was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me. Judge: You...!? Andrews: Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway. Judge: He was going to ruin him, huh...? Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed! Phoenix: What!? Judge: And do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: ... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is. Judge: Ah... I see. Edgeworth: ... Andrews: I... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all... Phoenix: P-Protect Mr. Engarde!? Judge: And yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior! Andrews: Yes, Your Honor. I understand. Witness Testimony -- Protecting Matt -- Andrews: From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer. Matt had to kill Juan no matter what. And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder. My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife... But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him... Judge: Hmm... This does account for everything... Andrews: Well... I am the logical type. Mia: We're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit. Judge: If the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!) Cross Examination -- Protecting Matt -- Andrews: From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Would you say that was your \"intuition\" speaking to you? Andrews: Don't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own. Phoenix: Urk... Andrews: If you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things. Phoenix: Three... things? Andrews: A motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear. Mia: You should have already known that, Phoenix... Phoenix: They didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember... Andrews: May I continue now? Andrews: Matt had to kill Juan no matter what. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference? Andrews: Yes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde. Judge: And you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews? Andrews: Yes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume. Phoenix: But... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference. Andrews: Oh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference? Phoenix: A-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony! Judge: Yes, I agree. Ms. Andrews, please correct your testimony, if you please. Andrews: \"Grasping at straws\" now, are we, Mr. Wright? Changes statement from \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" to \"I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\" Andrews: I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Has Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally? Andrews: ... Why do you ask? Phoenix: You were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out! Andrews: ... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern. In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill. Phoenix: (Why do I keep doing this to myself...?) Andrews: And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: B-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!? Andrews: I'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time. Judge: Hmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however. Phoenix: (The judge is glaring straight at Mia...) Mia: He's glaring at you, smart guy! Andrews: My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage! Andrews: Then... What about the button? Phoenix: The button...? Andrews: It's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume. Judge: You're talking about this button, correct? Andrews: That button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence. Phoenix: Urk. Judge: Looks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: A-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony! Andrews: I can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat. Mia: ... Phoenix: (... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...) Mia: With an icy stare, yes. Judge: Ms. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony. Changes statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\" Andrews: That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how do you know that? Andrews: When the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard. Phoenix: (Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?) Andrews: Don't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not! Phoenix: (Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?) Present Juan's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the victim's autopsy report.\" Andrews: But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time. Andrews: ! Edgeworth: Who's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it? Phoenix: This witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness. Andrews: ... Phoenix: As I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid. Mia: Really? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy. Phoenix: Wishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...) Mia: You should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk. Phoenix: Got it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!) Phoenix: This is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\". Andrews: S...Strangulation... Phoenix: The knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died. Judge: A-And what does that mean? Phoenix: Let's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when? Edgeworth: After the knife was stabbed into the victim... Phoenix: Exactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight! Andrews: Ah... Phoenix: That's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body! Judge: Order! Order! Wh-What is the meaning-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!? Phoenix: Let me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve? Edgeworth: What \"purpose\"...? Phoenix: We now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it? Edgeworth: ... Judge: Mr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!? To have a memento of the crime Phoenix: Maybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento... Edgeworth: Wright... I'll give this button to you as a memento. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: A reminder to never set foot in another court of law again for as long as you live! Judge: Yes... I think it would be for the best if you stayed away from the attorney's bench. Phoenix: W-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it! Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\" To pin the crime on Engarde Leads to: \"There is only one logical reason for doing something like that.\" To destroy evidence Phoenix: It was to destroy the evidence, of course! Edgeworth: ... Judge: ... Phoenix: Um... To destroy the evidence... Edgeworth: Yes, we heard you the first time! And which blasted piece of evidence was the person trying to destroy, Wright!? Phoenix: Umm... Judge: Mr. Wright! If you continue like this, I'm afraid you'll only destroy yourself! Phoenix: S-Sorry... Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\" Phoenix: There is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde! Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: There is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course! Judge: And... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!? Phoenix: (Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...) Mia: Phoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end! Phoenix: The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is... Present Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Adrian Andrews!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Wright. Which of these four doesn't belong here? Up, down, left, Wright. Phoenix: Um, \"Wright\"? Edgeworth: Thank you, I feel much better. I'm relieved to know you can at least pick that much out. I worry about you. You seem to fail every time you try to make logical sense! Mia: Or in other words, \"think before you speak\", Phoenix. Phoenix: (Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?) Judge: That's enough dawdling now, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Leads back to: \"The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\" Phoenix: Ms. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer! Andrews: Wh-What!? Judge: Order! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...? Phoenix: \"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews! Andrews: Wh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me! Phoenix: I can't, can I? Would you care to test me? Andrews: Then... Then what about this knife!? Phoenix: The knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you. Andrews: ...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!? Phoenix: This button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama! Andrews: Ughn... Phoenix: The only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews. Judge: I... I see... What about the empty guitar case...? Phoenix: That is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews! Andrews: N...No... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time! Judge: ...! Th-That's right! Phoenix: That's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body! Andrews: Aaaaaah! Phoenix: And to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him. Andrews: ...! Phoenix: Speaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not? Andrews: P-Please... Stop... Phoenix: Well, how about it, Ms. Andrews!? Andrews: Um... Phoenix: (I've got her this time!) Andrews: ... Judge: Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: ... I... I... I refuse... to testify. Phoenix: What was that...? Andrews: Th-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me! Judge: Well, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves. Phoenix: WHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...) von Karma: Adrian Andrews! Andrews: Y-Yes...? von Karma: Think hard about what we just discussed. Understood!? Andrews: A-Alright... ... Phoenix: (That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.) Mia: You did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done. Phoenix: Something I haven't done...? Edgeworth: Heh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence? Phoenix: ...! Judge: What is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: I'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: Everything you have proven is circumstantial. Phoenix: Circumstantial...? Edgeworth: Yes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida! Judge: M-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...? Andrews: I believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering. Judge: But Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...? Andrews: Maybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence. Phoenix: (NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...? Mia: Somehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation. Judge: I think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof. Phoenix: But! That's not true! Judge: In this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess. Phoenix: R-Recess...!? Judge: I request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial... Phoenix: (T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...) Phoenix: Phoenix: Please wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial! Edgeworth: What are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he? Phoenix: That... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya... Edgeworth: ...? Judge: But it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It is not impossible for this trial to continue. Andrews: ...! Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you... Edgeworth: It's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony! Judge: Y-Yes, that is very true, but... Edgeworth: Actually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews. Andrews: ... Edgeworth: When you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice. Andrews: Y-Yes... And...? Edgeworth: I can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice. Andrews: So my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already... Edgeworth: Before you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect. Andrews: Testify...!? Edgeworth: Your Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness. Judge: Hmm... Mia: I don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know... Judge: The court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please. Witness Testimony -- When I Found the Body -- Andrews: That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself. I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state. And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner. When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind. To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice. When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over. Judge: Hmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony? Andrews: ...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial. Mia: Phoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left... Phoenix: I know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?) Judge: Now then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- When I Found the Body -- Andrews: That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But... There wasn't anyone else in the room, right? Andrews: Of course not. Phoenix: Then... who did you pour it for? Andrews: Mr. Wright. There is a rhyme and reason for everything. Can you wait just a little longer for it to be revealed to you? Edgeworth: In other words, Wright, \"Be quiet and listen.\" Andrews: Precisely! I couldn't have said it better myself. Phoenix: Unnngh... Andrews: I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, it was a \"mess\"? Are you sure it wasn't messy because of your fight with Mr. Corrida...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I understand your frustrations at not being able to prove your theory. However... Before you go accusing people of crimes, go find yourself some evidence! Phoenix: (Grr...) Edgeworth: And then, what did you see next, witness? Andrews: And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Slumped over? Andrews: Yes, he was just sitting there with his head tilted forward, eyes closed. He really looked like he was sleeping. Phoenix: (...Is it just me or did that right there sound a little... odd?) Andrews: When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then what did cross your mind? Andrews: I thought maybe he had smashed everything up in anger because he lost the Grand Prix. And then felt tired after his rampage, so he decided to take a nap... Anyways, that's what I thought... Judge: I see. So you didn't think he was dead at all. Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\" Andrews: To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You thought he fainted...? Andrews: I thought he was asleep at first. But then, the room was in such a messy state... I thought maybe he had gotten into a fight with someone... Edgeworth: And that's when you went to pour the glass of juice? Andrews: Yes. He always has a hard time waking up. So Juan always has a glass of tomato juice to drink. Judge: Hmm... I see. And after that, what happened next? Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\" Andrews: When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how did you come to realize that he was, in fact, dead? Andrews: I shook him over and over, but I never got a response... So I set the glass down on the dresser and tried to take his pulse. I... I was shocked... and staggered backward... Edgeworth: And knocked the flower vase over. So that's what happened. Andrews: ...Yes. Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\" Mia: ... This is what it all comes down to. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: This is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case! Phoenix: (Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?) Phoenix: So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him? Andrews: No, not at all... Phoenix: Even though this is what you saw when you discovered the body? Andrews: ...Ah! Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: Isn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man! Andrews: Ah... Um... That's... Well, you see... Phoenix: I doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink! Judge: Y-Your point is...? Phoenix: Ms. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie! Andrews: Ungh! Phoenix: And your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer! Andrews: ... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: It looks like the defense has somehow brought the ugly truth to light. The defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde, is not guilty after all... Andrews: That... But that's impossible! You're wrong... Judge: M-Ms. Andrews! Try to have some composure! Andrews: It... It wasn't me... It wasn't me, I tell you! It was Matt! I swear it! He's the one who killed Juan! Phoenix: But you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you \"might\" end up incriminating yourself! Andrews: Th-That's because... Judge: Ms. Andrews, I will give you one last chance. What exactly are you hiding that may \"incriminate\" you? Andrews: ... I... I... I refuse... to testify. Judge: Then there is no need for this court to continue any further. Mr. Matt Engarde's innocence has been clearly demonstrated. Phoenix: (Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?) Mia: What's wrong, Phoenix? Phoenix: Usually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't. Judge: Now then, I would like to hand down my verdict for Mr. Matt Engarde. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor. The prosecution feels that it would be premature to pass down a verdict at this time. Judge: Wh-What...? Edgeworth: The reason is quite simple. This witness has yet to speak the absolute, real truth. Judge: The \"absolute, real truth\"...? What are you...? Edgeworth: Witness... Don't you understand yet? Andrews: ...Huh? Edgeworth: I don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you \"protect\" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the guilty party! Andrews: ...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you! Edgeworth: What...? Andrews: I... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty... Phoenix: (Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?) Andrews: I... I can't speak about it... I'm too scared... Mia: It's Franziska von Karma... Phoenix: Huh...? Mia: Don't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself. Phoenix: Th...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is... Mia: Yesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by Ms. von Karma. \"Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted.\" Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them... Phoenix: (Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!) Andrews: It wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...! Judge: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Judge: The court can't continue on like this, therefore I'd like to hear what you intend to do. Phoenix: (What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?) Edgeworth: Wright! I suggest you think very carefully about this! Think about what this witness did, and what she did NOT do! And think about who is the real mastermind behind this crime! Phoenix: (Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?) Edgeworth: Come now! What will you do!? What kind of man are you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Request \"not guilty\" verdict Phoenix: (No matter what she says... Ms. Andrews is the only person it could be! Not to mention... I don't have a choice. I have to win a complete acquittal today!) Y-Your Honor! The defense believes there is enough evidence to substantiate our claim! Therefore, we motion that this court passes a verdict of \"not guilty\" as soon as possible! Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, Wright! What have you learned in this past year!? Leads to: \"That's enough!\" Force Andrews to testify Phoenix: (I have to win a complete acquittal today... There's no way around that! But... I can't bring myself to do it like this! Not when she's making a face like that...) Ms. Andrews! I would like to know what you are really hiding! Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Are you sure you know what you're doing!? Phoenix: Sure, Mr. Engarde would get an acquittal, but in his place, you would be found guilty! Is this... Is this how you really want this trial to end!? Andrews: B-Be quiet... How dare you!? You... You're trying to trick me! Leads to: \"That's enough!\" Judge: That's enough! I commend you for trying, Mr. Edgeworth. However, it's clear that the defense's theory is the truth. Andrews: ...Y...You're wrong... Edgeworth: ... What a shame... (Changed from [Such a shame...] in the original release) Andrews: ...! Edgeworth: I had hoped things wouldn't come to this, however... Judge: Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Ms. Andrews. Since you absolutely refuse to testify... It falls on my shoulders to disclose this to the court. Andrews: ...S...Stop... Judge: M-Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: This witness... How should I put this... She has an illness. Andrews: What!? Edgeworth: And because of this illness, she has tried to commit suicide in the past. Andrews: S-Stop... Please stop...! Edgeworth: No matter how much you want to hide it, it's no use. I have the evidence right here. Andrews: Ah! Th-That's...! Phoenix: (That's the second part of the suicide report -- the attempted suicide report!) Edgeworth: What will you do now, witness? You know what I am about to do, don't you? I will now reveal to the court, the true nature of the pitiful woman known as Adrian Andrews! Phoenix: (The secret of her dependent nature... (Changed from [The secret of her co-dependant [sic] nature...] in the original release) Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...) Andrews: Please! Please STOP!! I beg you!! If people find out... If people find out... I... I'll... Edgeworth: If you're going to say you would \"choose death\", that is of no concern to me. Andrews: ...! Phoenix: (Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?) Edgeworth: However, before you die... I will pull the truth from your still-breathing lips! (Changed from [I will pull the truth from your breathing lips!] in the original release) ... No matter what I have to do. Andrews: ... Edgeworth: So, will you tell the court yourself, or shall I!? Either is fine with me. Andrews: ... ... ...I... I'll talk. But please... Help me... N-Nothing matters anymore... Witness Testimony -- My \"Crime\" -- Andrews: When I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest. When I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan. Once I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room. And then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button. Just when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience. And that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume. Judge: S-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!? Andrews: Isn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man! Judge: Wh... What do you mean by all of this...? Edgeworth: It might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth. Andrews: The real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time! Phoenix: (\"Last time\"...?) Edgeworth: So, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her \"crime\"! Phoenix: (Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?) Judge: Mr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination. Cross Examination -- My \"Crime\" -- Andrews: When I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But you could tell from the state the room was in, that there must have been a fight! Are you telling the truth when you say that you did not know he was dead? Andrews: He... had a scarf tied around his neck... But that scarf is a part of the Jammin' Ninja's costume... So... So I didn't think anything about it was strange... His head was also... tilted down a bit, so I couldn't see his face that well... That's why I thought I'd wake him up... and went to pour the juice... Andrews: When I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What is this \"plan\" you had? Andrews: ... I knew right away the murderer was Matt. I knew because Juan... He was going to expose Matt's weakest weakpoint to the world. So Matt did this to stop Juan, and silence him for good. That's when I thought, \"I should forge some evidence and pin this crime on Matt.\" Edgeworth: So the forged pieces of evidence were the knife and the button... Andrews: The first thing that came to mind was to plant the knife. Andrews: Once I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That was so you could get the knife, correct? Andrews: The knife Matt used at dinner had his fingerprints all over it. I thought if I used that, then the police would certainly turn their eyes towards him. Matt was napping with his costume on at the time. I slipped in, took the knife, and returned to the scene of the crime. Andrews: And then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were the one to stab the victim with that knife. Andrews: It gives me goosebumps to think about it now... What a horrible thing I did... But... At the time, I couldn't control my own body. It moved on its own. Then, when I stabbed Juan's dead body... I suddenly realized something. If I used the button somehow, I could make Matt look even more suspect. Edgeworth: So you thought to rip one of the buttons off and then plant it in Mr. Engarde's hakama. Andrews: Yes... That's what I had planned to do. ...But things never go that smoothly, do they? Andrews: Just when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: An \"inconvenience\"...? Andrews: There was a woman with a camera at the ready, loitering in the hallway. Phoenix: (I'm willing to bet my spikes it was Lotta...) Andrews: There was also a woman with a ray gun at the ready pacing back and forth... Phoenix: (That's Ms. Oldbag for you...) Andrews: I had already been caught and made into a big scoop for a certain weekly tabloid once, so I couldn't very well go out looking like myself and get caught again. Andrews: And that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were the one who prepared that costume, weren't you? Andrews: Yes. I took it from Global Studios... I also put it into Juan's guitar case the day before the award ceremony. Edgeworth: You did this in preparation for the press conference, correct? Andrews: Yes, Juan wanted to wear that costume and hold a press conference in it. He was going to disclose Matt's big secret there. Judge: And what is this \"secret\"...? Andrews: ... ...That, I don't know. Anyway, I thought that if I were to leave Juan's room in the Nickel Samurai costume... then people would think that Matt was the \"real\" murderer. I was very careful not to leave any fingerprints when I opened the guitar case. I absolutely did not want anyone to know about the costume. Phoenix: (I don't want to concede, but this testimony... it rings of the truth...) Mia: I'm sorry, Phoenix... Phoenix: N-No, please, don't apologize to me. We were both taken by surprise. Mia: Still, I'm sorry... After pressing all statements: Judge: I think we've heard enough! So, after that, you went back to Mr. Engarde's room and planted the button? Andrews: ...Into Matt's hakama? Yes. After that, I folded up the costume I was wearing and put it into a bag. Then I snuck it out of the hotel and got rid of it. Judge: M-My word... What does all this mean...? Andrews: ...Mr. Edgeworth, is it? Edgeworth: ... Andrews: The real criminal... is Matt Engarde!! Yesterday... That woman prosecutor sat me down for a talk... Phoenix: (Franziska, huh...) Andrews: She said that I should, under no circumstances, confess to what I had done. That if I just kept quiet, then Matt would be found guilty for sure... I... I had no choice but to believe in her words... Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: ... ............... Judge: What this witness has done is clearly unlawful. However... As long as her testimony stands, we can be certain she is not the real killer! Phoenix: W-Wait, Your Honor! The defense still... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wright. Phoenix: ! Edgeworth: It's pointless. At this point in time, it is not possible to indict Ms. Andrews on anything. Judge: Yes, exactly. There isn't a single piece of evidence that points to her as the murderer. The cross-examination of this witness is over. And so is today's trial. You couldn't establish that the witness was the culprit. Please let it go, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: B-But! Judge: Mr. Edgeworth, please place Ms. Andrews under arrest for further questioning. Edgeworth: Understood, Your Honor. The prosecution will arrange for her detention immediately. Judge: That's all. Court is adjourned for today! Phoenix: (Today's... Today's trial... It's over...! And I didn't win an acquittal!) Edgeworth: Witness... Would you mind if I asked you something? Phoenix: ...! (Edgeworth...?) Andrews: What is it...? Edgeworth: Before you leave court today, I wondered if I might look at one thing. The card in your hand. It's had my interest for quite some time now. What exactly is it...? Andrews: Oh, this...? Mr. Wright also asked about this. Although I didn't remember at the time you asked me about it, Mr. Wright, I remembered just now. I found this in the room on that day. Phoenix: \"The room\"...? Edgeworth: \"That day\"...? Andrews: Yes. I found this card when I discovered Juan's body. It was lying there right next to him... Phoenix: You found that card... next to the victim's body? Andrews: I suppose I must have unconsciously slipped it into my pocket... ...But it's not as if this card has any relevance to Juan's murder, right? Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess not. But it's still a strange card, if you ask me... But as far as a clue to this case...? I don't see why...) ???: Edgeworth: Witness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry! Phoenix: E-Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Do you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time! Andrews: I... I didn't mean to... Mia: Wh-What is this all about...? Phoenix: (I've never seen Edgeworth so emotional before... (Changed from [I've never seen such an emotional Edgeworth in my entire life...] in the original release) That card... What in the world is it? And what does it mean...!?) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!

Pearl: I... I can't take it... anymore... ...Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... Phoenix: L-Look! It'll be alright! Everything may still work out. Pearl: Hm...? Phoenix: The condition was that we had to get a \"not guilty\" verdict. And so far, the kidnapper has kept his word and hasn't hurt Maya. And he won't because Mr. Engarde hasn't been given a \"guilty\" sentence yet! Pearl: Unngg... Nnmff... *sniffle, sniffle* Phoenix: Cheer up! We don't have time to stand around crying! We have to get going! Pearl: ... Y-You're right... Mystic Maya is in much more pain than I am! Phoenix: Yes, that's right. So... ???: Hey! You guys! Glad I caught you, pal! Pearl: M-Mr. Scruffy Detective... Phoenix: (...Oh boy. Looks like Detective Gumshoe... has been dubbed \"Mr. Scruffy Detective\" in Pearls's book now...) Gumshoe: It's just plain ol' \"Mr. Dick Gumshoe\" now, and I came to talk to you, pal! Phoenix: (But we're kind of busy right now...) Examine Charley the plant Gumshoe: Hey, it's wilting a little! Pearl: I'll... I'll give it some delicious water, pal! Phoenix: Ah, it's OK... I already did that... Gumshoe: ...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...? Phoenix: (Did he just call the watering can, \"Mr.\"?) Poster Pearl: This is the... uh... Nickel Samurai, right? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, that's right. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!? Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. Pearl: Oh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either... Gumshoe: B-But I can read AND I'm tall, pal! Phoenix: P-Please stop competing with an 8 year old... It's disturbing... Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night! Gumshoe: B-But I can get it even more cleaner, pal! Pearl: Aaah! That's... That's for the toilet!! Phoenix: (What a mess. Literally...) Talk The future Phoenix: So, what are you going to do from now on? Gumshoe: Whadaya mean, pal? Phoenix: Well, you've been fired, right? So, do you have a new job lined up yet? Gumshoe: Oh, that! A-Ah... What am I supposed to do now, pal!? I... I don't have anything coming in at all until my next payday! Phoenix: Wh-What are you talking about!? You don't have another payday! Gumshoe: ... I guess that means I'm just gonna half [sic] to work here at your place, pal! Phoenix: S-SAY WHAT!? Gumshoe: You'll be searching for things that will prove Mr. Engarde's innocence all day, right? Phoenix: W-Well... yeah... Gumshoe: So yeah! I'm going to help you, pal! I've got lots of experience in investigating, and watching over people's places! And I'm great at making really simple meals, pal! I'll take care of it all! Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's let Mr. Scruffy Detective take care of things! Phoenix: A-Ah... OK... By the way, what's your best dish? Gumshoe: Instant noodles, pal. Phoenix: (Why am I surrounded by people who only eat cheap, unhealthy foods...?) Edgeworth Gumshoe: ...That was the first time I've ever seen Mr. Edgeworth act like that... Never thought he'd say something like, he didn't care if Ms. Andrews killed herself... Pearl: H-He said that!? That's horrible... Gumshoe: But because of him doing that, we got the truth finally. Phoenix: ...The truth... (Ms. Andrews' last testimony; I wonder if that was the truth...?) I'll give you that there was nothing strange in her testimony itself. But... I still think there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole thing. Gumshoe: You mean about \"that\" thing, pal? Phoenix: Why would she want to -- no, I mean, almost \"need\" to frame Mr. Engarde... I couldn't figure that out from anything she said all day! Gumshoe: ... Then... Then you're saying that testimony... was a lie...? Phoenix: Not a lie, per se... It just feels like there's more here than meets the eye. Or that's what Edgeworth would like us to believe... Pearl: Th-That's such a dirty trick! Even that woman prosecutor was better than that! Phoenix: (Franziska von Karma...) Speaking of Ms. von Karma, do you have any more information on her condition? Wasn't she shot this morning!? Franziska (appears after \"Edgeworth\") Gumshoe: Ms. von Karma was shot today on the way to the trial by a pistol, pal. Phoenix: B-But she's going to be fine, right? I mean, Edgeworth said she was in \"stable condition\", but... Gumshoe: Well, she was shot in the shoulder, so she's OK and still hanging in there. They should be done taking the bullet out, so she's probably resting at the hospital. Phoenix: Which one...? Gumshoe: What? Are you going to visit her, pal? Phoenix: N-No... Well, I was kind of thinking about it... Gumshoe: Hey! You've actually got a heart, don't you!? She looked like she was being tortured to death not being able to go to the trial today, so maybe it'd be good for her if you went and let her whip you for a bit, pal! Pearl: Let's go let her whip us, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Now I'm DEFINITELY not going. Gumshoe: Um... let's see... The name of the hospital... Oh yeah! The \"Hotti Clinic\"! Phoenix: (That name sends a chill down my spine... Well, I guess it can't hurt to stop by and say hi...) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Look, it's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Oh! It's a little tarnished, don't you think, pal? Don't worry! I'll make it all sparkly shiny again! Phoenix: (I... I'm really touched...) Radio Transceiver Gumshoe: Have you heard anything from the kidnapper...? Phoenix: ...No... not yet. Gumshoe: I'm sure once he hears what happened at the trial today, he'll call, pal. But remember! You can't provoke him when you get to talk to him! Jammin' Ninja's Button Gumshoe: When I saw that button, I thought to myself, \"This is gonna prove Mr. Engarde's guilty!\"... But it looks like there was a lot more to it than I thought, huh pal? Phoenix: You're a pro. You should know better than to say something like that. Gumshoe: W-Well, I'm not a cop anymore. Just a regular helper around the office now, so... Phoenix: (I wonder if he misses working down at the precinct...?) Knife Gumshoe: Who would've thought that this knife Mr. Engarde used to eat his dinner steak with... Phoenix: Go on... Gumshoe: ...That it would be stabbed into the victim's body by Ms. Andrews, of all people. I guess she just hated the victim that much, huh pal? Phoenix: The question isn't why she hated the victim to that extend, but rather why she tried to pin the murder on Mr. Engarde. Pearl: I wonder if she really hates Mr. Engarde? Lotta's Photo Gumshoe: So this \"Nickel Samurai\" was really Ms. Andrews, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. This is either when she went to Mr. Engarde's room to get the knife... ...or when she was done with the foul deed. But I guess we'll never know. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: It'll be OK! You'll see her again, little missy! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Gumshoe: It's really important that you don't give up! Pearl: O-OK! Phoenix: (I guess a big voice really does give you a sense of presence...) Pearl: I... I won't give up. Ever! Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Cheer up! You can't give in, missy! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Gumshoe: Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol... ... I... I don't have my pistol or my police badge anymore... Pearl: Cheer up! You can't give in! Gumshoe: Y-Yeah! Phoenix: (What are those two doing...?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: People are jealous of my roguishly cool \"detective look\", pal. It's because of this look that I passed the detective's test, you know. Phoenix: Oh. Gumshoe: But you know, people can't coast through life on their looks alone, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, you can't count on your looks alone. Pearl: Wow... I learned something new today... Franziska von Karma profile Phoenix: Is she alright...? After being shot, I mean... Gumshoe: Her wound isn't that bad... Well, the gunshot wound anyway... But the wound to her pride, now that's a different story, pal. Phoenix: The wound to her pride? Gumshoe: Well, until now, she's always upheld the \"Von Karma Creed\", but since she came here, well, you've given her pride quite a beating, pal. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: I mean, she may act all grown-up, but she's really still just an 18 year old. ...Quite frankly, I worry about her, pal. Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: That's the first time I've seen that side of Mr. Edgeworth, pal. Forcing people to say what he wants them to during testimony... I want to know what in the world happened to him all this time he's been gone... Matt Engarde profile Gumshoe: I can't believe it. Maya getting kidnapped all because of this guy... I mean, what kind of person is the real murderer anyway!? Pearl: Maybe they're a big fan of Mr. Engarde? Phoenix: (But the kidnapper's voice... He sounded like an old man to me...) Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: My impression of her has totally changed, pal. Phoenix: Um... So, where is she right now...? Gumshoe: I'm sure she's being questioned down at the precinct. At the very least about messing with the body, and obstructing the investigation. And she'll probably be staying over at the detention center... Phoenix: (The detention center, huh...) Celeste Inpax profile Gumshoe: She was Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor. Phoenix: (Because of the suicide of the mentor she depended on, Adrian Andrews tried to follow her in an attempted suicide... Now the question is, who is Ms. Andrews relying on now...?) Anything else Phoenix: Could you please take a look at this...? Gumshoe: Um... I can't think of anything to say about this, pal. ... Wh-Why don't I make us some instant noodles, instead? Phoenix: Th-That's OK... Really. March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (From what the guard told me... It sounds like along with Mr. Engarde, Ms. Andrews is also being detained here.) Pearl: Then we should talk with them since we're here... Phoenix: Yeah, but both of them are still in questioning. Pearl: Hmm... And we don't have time to waste. Phoenix: (Yeah, visiting hours are almost over...) Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitor's the visitor's room. Catching a few z's while he's standing; now that's a good way to spend free time. March 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby Pearl: Alright now, Mr. Nick! Let's go look for clues! We have to, for Mystic Maya's sake... ???: You shall not pass! Phoenix: *gasp* Ms. Oldbag! Oldbag: Don't devalue my name and turn it into a gasp, you spiky-headed poof! Because of you, I've been made to look like the bad guy again! Although, I did get a piece of gum from Edgey-boy, just as he promised... But what I really wanted was something much more valuable! I wanted Edgey-poo's heart! I want it all for me! It's all your fault! You've awakened the wild beast inside of this Oldbag! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! (Changed from [Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!] in the original release) Pearl: Aah! Ms. Oldbag! Oldbag: Keep your hands off of me! This helmet is airtight! No air's [sic] gets in and no air gets out! Phoenix: Umm... Then why do you keep putting it on...?Umm... What does your helmet have to do with anything? Oldbag: Hmph! Don't tal release ({{{2}}})hink you can get me to move with silly questions! You're going to have to defeat me if you want to get by! Phoenix: (I'm not hearing this...) Examine Anywhere Oldbag: Hey! I said no restless loitering and no touching! You're interfering with my watch, and that's a no-no! Phoenix: (Argh. Looks like in order to search around here... I have to first get this kooky \"alien\" to go away...) Talk Any options Phoenix: Um... Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Oldbag: Hah! You're a million light-years too early to be asking ME questions, whippersnapper! Phoenix: (Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky \"alien\"...) Present Anything Phoenix: Umm... Could you please take a look at this...? Oldbag: Hmph! Sorry, sonny. I can't see it very well through this helmet! Phoenix: (Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky \"alien\"...) Oldbag: I see that look in your eyes! You stop thinking I'm an alien from outer space this instant! March 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Pearl: Wow. Everybody looks really busy with something or another... Phoenix: Hmm... They're probably strengthening the evidence for tomorrow's trial. Detective: Hey! Hurry up with that, will ya!? Pass that victim's list around! ...Now you're speaking nonsense! There's more than 100 people on there! Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick...? Is Mr. Engarde a really bad, terrible criminal...? Phoenix: ... Actually, Pearls, never mind. It sounds like they're working on a different case... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"...Very well. Now why do you want to work for our company?\" \"Well, that would have to be because I feel I would like to help this company grow.\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for corporate interviews. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Prosecutor von Karma was shot in front of the courthouse!? Wh-Who did it!? Who shot her!? Phoenix: (I have a sneaking suspicion that even Gumshoe could do this guy's job...) After clearing \"Franziska\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices: March 22Hotti ClinicReception Phoenix: (...Never thought I'd ever come back to this place...) ???: Hmm, yes... Are you here to visit a patient? Hmm... Phoenix: Ah, hi... ...Wait a second! You're...! ???: Hmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. Phoenix: Why are you still here!? Hotti: Hmm, yes... What is it? Hmm... Can I help you? You can tell me... Hmm, yes... ???: Director Hotti! Phoenix: E-Edgeworth... Hotti: Hmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. ...Oh, you're the man from this morning. Hmm, yes... What is it?... Uh huh... Edgeworth: Director. Franziska... How is Franziska von Karma? Hotti: Hmm... You don't need to worry. Hmm, yes... She's in good hands... Because, you see... I'm personally taking good care of her... Hmm, yes... Hee hee. Hmm, yes... and that thing... that surgery... It went well. Edgeworth: ...You have my gratitude. Phoenix: (It looks like Edgeworth doesn't know about this \"Director\" and his secret...) Hotti: She looked so pitiful -- absolutely terrified. Hmm, yes... But I understand, hmm... Hmm, yes... Her opponent was a gun, after all. Uh huh. And when I snuck up on her real secret-like, she would scream really loud. Hmm, yes. Edgeworth: I see. Hotti: Ah, but she's really cute too. When I'd do that, she'd whip me with her whip, uh huh... Boy did I cry like a baby. Hmm, yes... But I think I could get used to it. Hmm... Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! von Karma: Go back to your room. Hotti: You're so mean, uh huh... So mean... my frisky Friska. But that's good too-- Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! OK, OK... I... Hmm, yes... It's time for my IV drops. Hmm, yes... von Karma: ... And what are those tulips doing in your hand, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Argh! I knew I shouldn't have come here!) Examine Waiting room on left Phoenix: This must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients. Hotti: Hmm, yes... well, visiting hours are over. That's why... Hmm... It's time for nightly consultations to begin... Mine, that is... Heh heh heh. Phoenix: (...Isn't there anyone keeping an eye on this guy...?) Door at the back Phoenix: (I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?) Hotti: Oh, that's the X-ray room. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: H-H-How did you know what I was thinking!? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, it's... Because that's the X-ray room... Uh huh, yes... Phoenix: (There is something very peculiar about this guy... Because I know it's not me...) Limping patient Phoenix: This patient is undergoing rehabilitation. Hotti: Wasn't that patient standing in the same spot the last time you came to visit? Doesn't look like they've moved any closer to the reception desk, huh? Is this clinic really doing anything!? Is that patient really getting better!? Hmm... Phoenix: Hey! Don't just cut into my monologue like that! I'm explaining things here! Hotti: Ah, sorry. Hmm, yes... Most sorry... Yes... Uh, huh... Reception area Phoenix: This is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's \"Word to the Wise\": \"Put your best foot forward.\" Putting this up at a general clinic like this is doesn't really mean much, does it...? Talk The shooting von Karma: I was shot in front of the courthouse, in my right shoulder. Hmph... It's no big deal. This sort of thing happens all the time. I even had full intentions of running the trial this morning. Pearl: But! But that would've been too much for you! (Changed from [But! But that would've been too much!] in the original release) Phoenix: (There's no need to act tough in front of us, you know...) (Changed from [Yeah! You looked like you were deathly scared until only a few minutes ago...] in the original release) von Karma: Regardless, I was dragged here by THAT man over there. (Changed from [But I was dragged here by THAT prosecutor.] in the original release) He was so unyielding, one has to wonder if he was simply interested in stealing my case. (Changed from [He even went so far as to grab me by the wrist the whole way here.] in the original release) Edgeworth: It was the only logical course of action given the bullet was still lodged in your shoulder. But by taking over the case... (Changed from [But with me doing so...] in the original release) I found myself having to clean up after you and that irresponsible deal you made. von Karma: ...! Phoenix: (I think I know what \"deal\" he's referring to...) The deal Phoenix: Ms. von Karma. You made a deal with Ms. Andrews yesterday, didn't you? von Karma: I don't know what you mean. Phoenix: In order to make sure you got your guilty verdict on Mr. Engarde, you told Ms. Andrews to not testify in court today. von Karma: Hmph, I don't know what you're talking about. Do you have proof that I made such a deal? Phoenix: Y-You're denying it!? von Karma: ... It looks like you were lucky, Mr. Phoenix Wright. If I had been in court today, this trial would already be over. Phoenix: All while hiding Ms. Andrews' own crime? von Karma: That isn't my problem. Whether she had tampered with evidence or not... I have only one objective. To find Engarde guilty of murder. The end justifies the means, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The end justifies the means. Present Anything Phoenix: Aah! von Karma: ... Phoenix: (I guess that's all I get...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Ms. von Karma. Adrian Andrews believed you when you said, \"If you don't tell the truth of what really happened, then Engarde will be found guilty.\" von Karma: And what does that have to do with me? Phoenix: Because of that, she is now in danger of being found guilty herself! All because she believed in your words until the very end... von Karma: ... That still has nothing to do with me. She's just a weak person, that's all. Phoenix: But you had to know she was... OWWW! von Karma: ... I think visiting hours here are about over. So, if you'll excuse me. Pearl: What's wrong? Why did she suddenly cut you off...? Phoenix: (Probably because she thinks I had the advantage in that argument... ...Edgeworth...) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: What happened today at the trial, Edgeworth? That was not like you at all... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: I mean, I know you knew about Ms. Andrews' condition. You could have made her testify as many times as you wanted, but to go that far...! Edgeworth: ...Ah, but she wouldn't testify about THAT until I said something. Listen, Wright. The courtroom is a garden of judgment. I am putting myself on the line when I stand in there. And that's why I made the witness do the same... It's only natural. Adrian's card Phoenix: By the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you. Edgeworth: Witness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry! Edgeworth: Do you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time! Phoenix: That card... What in the world is it? Edgeworth: ... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it. Phoenix: I-I understand. Edgeworth: Their task is to find the \"owner\" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that. Phoenix: (An assassin!?) Picture Card added to the Court Record. Adrian's card (subsequent times) Phoenix: By the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you. Edgeworth: Witness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry! Edgeworth: Do you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time! Phoenix: That card... What in the world is it? Edgeworth: ... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it. Phoenix: I-I understand. Edgeworth: Their task is to find the \"owner\" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that. Phoenix: (An assassin!?) Assassin (appears after \"Adrian's card\") Phoenix: So who is this \"Shelly de Killer\"? Edgeworth: \"De Killer\" is the name of a long standing line of assassins. Pearl: Long standing? Edgeworth: The name first appeared about 100 years ago, I hear. Shelly is the professional name of the third heir to the De Killer name. Phoenix: So because his professional name is \"Shelly\", he leaves cards with a shell on them...? Edgeworth: He has a habit of making sure to leave a card by the body of his victims. Pearl: Why would he do something like that...? Edgeworth: We think it is a part of his duty to his clients. Phoenix: His \"duty\"? Edgeworth: If he leaves a card, then his clients can be assured it was he who killed the victim. It also serves as insurance against any charges being pushed onto his clients. Phoenix: ...I see... Edgeworth: De Killer values the trust between his clients and himself above all else. It seems that this is one honorable assassin with a moral conscience. Phoenix: (I guess that even honorable assassins can exist...) So, you think this assassin... You think he's the one who did the killing in this case? Edgeworth: It would appear that way. The discovery of the card basically confirms it, wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: (Shelly de Killer, huh...) Maya's situation (appears after \"Assassin\") Leads to: \"I noticed something at the trial today.\" Present Anything Edgeworth: ...I've been put in charge of this case. So I can't give you any help with reagards to clues or evidence. Phoenix: You sure are hardnosed. Totally different from Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: ...And that is why he was fired. Phoenix: (He's got a point...) Edgeworth: I noticed something at the trial today. You were behaving in a very strange manner. ...Is something the matter? Phoenix: (I guess... I should just tell him.) Maya... She's been kidnapped. Edgeworth: K-Kidnapped? What does the kidnapper want!? Phoenix: An acquittal. Edgeworth: ... I see. I had no idea. ... I will prepare a rescue team as soon as possible, and resolve this by tomorrow. Pearl: R-Really!? Did you hear that, Mr. Nick!? M-Mr. Edgeworth is going to... Phoenix: Stop trying to console me, Edgeworth! I don't need your pity! Pearl: Mr. Nick? Phoenix: There's no way you can find her. We don't have even a single clue to go on. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: There's only one way to save her. I... I have to get an acquittal somehow! It's the only way! Edgeworth: ... Wright. Listen, you need to know something. Juan Corrida was killed by Shelly de Killer. And the client who ordered the job... is Matt Engarde... Your own client. Phoenix: Please, stop! ...I can't listen to you. I can't believe that. Edgeworth: ...I see. Well, if you want to continue your investigation, you will need this. Pearl: What is it? Edgeworth: The hotel right now is restricted to police personnel only, as we are looking for any clues that might lead us to Shelly de Killer. If you take this with you to the hotel, I'm sure they will let you enter. Letter of Introduction added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: ...In any case, I must attend to the preparations for Maya's rescue team. We'll meet again, if anything should happen. Now if you'll excuse me... Pearl: Mr. Nick? Do you... Do you think... Mr. Engarde hired an assassin...? Phoenix: No way! (I mean, he doesn't have a Psyche-Lock...) Pearl: Y-Yeah, I guess not... Phoenix: Maya... Please... All I ask is you make it home, safe and sound! Date:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Maya: Heh heh. I guess even kidnappers can be a little clumsy. Clumsy enough to drop a card like this for me. And even though he said he was an \"assassin\", I bet he's just making that up, like how Nick does with everything in court. Anyway, let's try out the card trick with this card I just found... ...*click*... Maya: Sounds like I got the door open... OK! Time to go take a look around! Examine Door Maya: I've unlocked the door with this card... I should probably go and take a look around... Date:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Maya: Wh-What is this place...? I've got a feeling I'm not in the hotel anymore... Are those videos over there? ...Well, I'll worry about that later. For now, I should be looking for clues. That way, I can show them to sis and maybe get out of here! Examine TV Maya: Wow, I've never seen a TV this big before. Now where's the power button... Hmm... ...*click*... Maya: ... Phooey. It's busted. I would so die a happy Samurai fan... if I ever got to see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this. ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about dying, all things considered... Satellite dish Maya: What is this thing? An antenna... I guess? And this is... a VCR? There sure are a lot of electronic gadgets here. But what is an antenna doing here...? Computer Maya: Oh, hey. It's a computer. I've never really used one before. ... Um... I have no idea where the power switch on this thing is... Drat. There goes my plan to use this somehow to get out of here. Table Maya: There's a framed picture sitting on this coffee table. It's a picture of a woman... She's kind of pretty. Hey, looks like something's written here... Let's see... I think it says, \"With love... Celeste\" I bet this could be a clue... Sofa Maya: ...That's weird. What's a figurine doing on a sofa in a place like this...? I think it's... a bear. Aww, how cute! But it's got a lot of cuts and slits on it... I wonder if it's some kind of puzzle or something... Video tapes Maya: It's so dark in here that I can barely see, but... these kinda feel like... video tapes... All of them... Just what kind of room is this...? Door Maya: Unngh... Locked. Of course. And it doesn't look like I can use the card to open this door. There's a little hole at the bottom of the door. If only I was a little skinnier. Then maybe I'd be able to crawl through there... After examining satellite dish, table, sofa, and door: ???: Oh, this simply will not do... I cannot have you wandering around at will. Maya: Eeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ???: ...It seems... that your Mr. Wright is truly concerned about you. Maya: He is...? ???: For now, I would suggest you remain cooperative. If you cannot, there are ways in which I can help you... Maya: Ways... You mean... ???: \"Dead men tell no tales\" is how the saying goes, correct? Maya: \"D-D-D-D-Dead\"!? ???: I'm almost certain I told you on our first meeting. I am... an assassin. Maya: N-No way... You're lying... I mean... An assassin...? ???: ...People are not always who they appear to be. Maya: Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick! March 22, 7:04 PMHotti ClinicReception Pearl: Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Hm? O-Oh yes, Pearls? (Got caught up in my thoughts about Maya's situation...) Pearl: Mr. Edgeworth has left, you know. Phoenix: (I guess for now, I have no choice but to believe in Mr. Engarde. But I think I should listen to his story one more time...) Alright! Let's get going, too. Pearl: OK! March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Jailer: I'm sorry, but visiting hours are over for today. Pearl: Aw... Phoenix: (Argh... I have too many questions I need to ask...) I-I'm sorry, but I'm Phoenix Wright, a lawyer for one of the... Jailer: You're Mr. Wright, you say? Oh, yeah, there's a message here for you. Phoenix: A message...? Jailer: It's from Matt Engarde. ...Ah, here you are. Pearl: What did he write!? Is it something really important...? Phoenix: I don't know. Well, let's see what it has to say... \"To Mr. Lawyer dude, I've got something really important to tell you.\" (Changed from ['To the lawyer dude. I've got something really important to tell you.'] in the original release) (Why do I feel uneasy all of a sudden...?) Engarde: ... ... Oh, Mr. Wright. So actually... I have a favor to ask of you. I have this cat named Shoe. I didn't put out a lot of food when I left the house, so he's probably pretty hungry. You think you could drop by my house and feed Shoe for me, dude? My house is just a little ways down from the hotel, alright? Phoenix: ... Pearl: Th-This is terrible! Let's hurry! We have to feed his cat! I'm sure poor Shoe's stomach is growling by now! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I guess... Matt's Note jammed into a pocket. Phoenix: (A client's request is a request... Guess I should go check up on his cat.) Hotel Lobby Present Letter of Introduction Leads to: \"Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...\" Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...) Um... Ms. Oldbag... If you would look at... Oldbag: What!? You want me to look at this worthless piece of... .................. ...Edgey-pooooo... Phoenix: (Ugh... Is that her perfume, Ph\u00e9romone d'Amour, I smell...? *shudder*) Oldbag: Let's see here... \"Would you please allow this unsophisticated young person to conduct his investigation? Yours truly, Miles Edgeworth\" Phoenix: \"Y-Yours truly\"!? Oldbag: Hmph, that man's good at flattery. Fine. But only because Edgey-poo said so, you understand!? Letter of Introduction given to Ms. Oldbag. Oldbag: I just thought of something I have to do. Remember, no messing around! You do anything bad and I won't let you off the hook! Pearl: It looks like she has strong feelings for Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: That may be, but you know nothing's going to come of it. Pearl: That's so mean, Mr. Nick! Feelings are meant to be told and shared! Phoenix: Owww... (Every time we talk about love, I always end up with a handprint on my face somehow.) Um, so anyway, let's continue our investigation. Pearl: OK! Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Phoenix: Ack! What!? What now!? Oldbag: One little thing, before I forget. You can't go into Engarde's room today. Pearl: Why? Oldbag: The police's main investigation team is going to be in there all day, you hear? Phoenix: (I wonder if they're the team in charge of investigating \"De Killer\"...?) Oldbag: So don't go in there! Set one foot in there and you'll face the wrath of Wendy Oldbag! Examine Stage Phoenix: It's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but... Pearl: But that press conference... Phoenix: It was really the victim, Juan Corrida, trying to disclose something about Mr. Engarde. Pearl: But they're both heroes... Why would they do something so un-heroic? Phoenix: They may look like heroes on the outside, but on the inside, they're only human. Pearl: ... After clearing \"Maya's situation\" Talk option in Hotti Clinic - Reception, then visiting Detention Center: March 22Engarde MansionLiving Room Phoenix: (Hmm, sure is dark...) Pearl: I'll go turn on a light! Phoenix: Wow... So this is what a star's house looks like. Must be nice to be rich. Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's find Shoe, the kitty-cat! Shoooooe! Shoe: Meow. Phoenix: So I guess this is Shoe. Pearl: Ah, what a lovely cat. ...Hello, Shoe. Shoe: Meow. Pearl: ...Tee hee. Phoenix: (The cat seems to like Pearls.) ???: Pardon me... Phoenix: ! ???: May I help you with something, Mister... Phoenix: Oh, uh, we're lawyers. Actually, I'm Mr. Engarde's lawyer. ???: The master's... Then, you must be Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes. ???: Ah, it's a pleasure to meet your wonderful self. Doe: I am the family butler, John Doe. Phoenix: Nice to meet you. Shoe: Meow. Examine Fireplace Pearl: Oh! There's a giant cooking hearth here. Phoenix: That's actually a fireplace. Pearl: How are they different, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... (You know, I've never actually seen a hearth before, come to think of it...) Pearl: You should come and visit Fey Manor, then. I'll show you one when you do. Motorcycle Pearl: A... A giant bicycle is flying through the air! Phoenix: ... That bicycle, Pearls, is one where you don't have to pedal, and it moves on its own. Pearl: Really!? Wow! Phoenix: But sorry to disappoint you, it can't fly. Pearl: ...Oh. That's too bad. Lounge set Phoenix: It's a very comfortable and spacious lounge set. I wonder if famous stars drop by and sit around and have a good time. ...In any case, I don't really belong here, do I? ... Argh. What is with me and feeling inferior today...? Pearl: ? Masks Pearl: Ah! There are masks here! Phoenix: Yeah. That one in the middle is the Steel Samurai. The ones next to that are the Pink Princess and the Evil Magistrate. They fought many battles against the backdrop of Neo Olde Tokyo. Pearl: Wow, you really know a lot about the Steel Samurai, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: ... (I don't know whether to laugh or cry that I know more about that show than a kid...) Doorway behind railing Phoenix: There's another door over there. Pearl: You shouldn't go wandering off over there, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: ...Yes, Pearls. (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her to stop playing around...) Door Pearl: There's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: I bet it's for Mr. Engarde's cat to use. Pearl: Oh, you mean Shoe. Phoenix: (The door... It's locked tight. Well, I guess that's to keep nosey people like me from entering it.) Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: You must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right? Doe: Honestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs. Phoenix: (Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...) John Doe Phoenix: Mr. Doe, how long have you served at this residence...? Doe: Well, sir, I would have to say... maybe about one year? Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of himself and his affairs. Phoenix: (You know, I would've thought Mr. Engarde the kind to have a maid over a butler...) ([maid] in quotation marks in the original release) Shoe Phoenix: That's a very cute cat you've got here. Doe: It is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat. Phoenix: (...Well then. I guess I don't need this piece of scrap paper anymore.) Matt's Note crumpled into a ball and thrown away. Shoe (subsequent times) Phoenix: That's a very cute cat you've got here. Doe: It is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat. Present Matt Engarde profile Phoenix: You must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right? Doe: Honestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder. Phoenix: ... Doe: ... Phoenix: And, uh, anything else? Doe: No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs. Phoenix: (Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...) Any evidence Phoenix: I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look at this. Doe: I'm afraid I cannot offer up anything special about it. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of evidence for a trial. Phoenix: (Polite yet snotty with a touch of rude. He's the stereotypical butler alright.) Any other profiles Phoenix: Would you happen to know who this person is...? Doe: No, I would not. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master's acquaintances. Phoenix: (Then what in the world CAN I talk to you about!?) Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! Being angry is bad! After clearing all Talk options: Doe: ...Well, I'm afraid I must take my leave of you now. Phoenix: Oh, we should probably get going ourselves. Doe: Ah, so young and yet already so accomplished. A master of law... Phoenix: But there is also a lot to be proud of in being a butler, in charge of the house and all. Doe: Thank you for the compliment, sir. ...People are not always who they appear to be. ...Now if you'll excuse me. Shoe: Meow. March 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall Phoenix: Looks like we're the only ones here. Pearl: And yet... the hotel seems so busy somehow... Phoenix: (Probably because the police team is scouring for clues about \"De Killer\"...) Examine Front table Pearl: I want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again... Phoenix: Yeah, me too... Pearl: Whenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot. Phoenix: Well, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast! Pearl: OK! Let's work really hard, then! March 22Gatewater HotelHallway Lotta: Hey, City Boy! Phoenix: L-Lotta... You're still here... Lotta: Reckon course! An investigative photographer eats or starves on her ability to snap up the scoop, yeah!? And this hotel just has that \"aura of mystery\". Ya know, like something's always about to happen. Pearl: But... Do you have a camera? Lotta: Reckgiven! A photographer's gotta have cameras out the ear like corn to be a real pro, ya know!? So I'm hangin' around here... ... ... Speaking of cameras and feedin' the mouth, do ya have mine, ya bread-thief!? Phoenix: (Why can't you drop that \"thief\" thing already?) Examine Teddy bear Pearl: Aww, how lovely! The teddy bear looks happy to be surrounded by so many beautiful flowers. Phoenix: (Pearls really seems to like teddy bears a lot.) Phoenix: Ah... I wonder if... Lotta also... Lotta: I didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word! Phoenix: (Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?) Flowers on left Phoenix: Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Although, other than sunflowers and tulips, I have no idea what any of them are. Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick? What's this flower called? Phoenix: It's a sunflower... I think. Pearl: This flower over here is pretty too. Phoenix: That's a tulip, I guess. Pearl: ... Lotta: Callin' everythin' a sunflower or a tulip; don't reckon even little kids'll fall for that! Door on right Phoenix: There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". Pearl: The old lady told us about this, didn't she? That we can't go in this room tonight. Phoenix: (I wonder if an investigation briefing is going on right now inside... Without Detective Gumshoe...) Talk Night of the murder Phoenix: I want to ask you about the night of the murder. Lotta: What? Ya really gonna shell out the bucks for the info I got!? Phoenix: Lotta, you were loitering in this hallway the night of the murder, were you not? Lotta: Well, kinda... But... Phoenix: (Brace yourself, Phoenix. Here it comes...) (Changed from [Brace yourself, Wright. Here it comes...] in the original release) Lotta: I didn't exactly hang around here the entire time, ya know. Followed a few stars around... got a few autographs, shook a few hands, had a soda-pop with a few of 'em too. Phoenix: (Looks like she wasn't here the entire time that night...) Pearl: The security lady also wasn't in this hallway the whole time either. Phoenix: (I guess this means there's no one who can tell us who came and went that night...) Scandal Phoenix: So, about the note that was inside your camera case. Lotta: Oh, that ditty I wrote? Phoenix: Yeah... Can I believe what you've written? Lotta: Ya mean the stuff about Engarde shovin' his manager lady onto Corrida? Phoenix: Yeah... Lotta: Ah, well, I reckon ya best not be believin' that. Phoenix: What? Lotta: Look, I sorta wrote that on a whim, ya know? Writin' whatever came to mind. Pearl: \"Whatever came to mind\"...? Lotta: Yeah, when ya get down to it, it's just a lotta random bull dooders. Phoenix: ... Pearl: ... Lotta: Hey, what's with ya!? Why ya starin' at me like my grandpa used to!? Phoenix: Hmph. Lotta: Hey, and why do you look like you suddenly got older too!? Or am I just shrinkin' here!? Pearl: Umm... Camera Lotta: Ah! My baby! My $1,600 baby! What's with that red-coated prosecutor anyhow!? The guy told me it was \"evidence\" and refused to give it back to me! Phoenix: Well, that's kind of how it is... Lotta: Hey, hey. Yer that red-coat's friend, ain't ya? So put in a few good words for me and git me back my camera. Phoenix: Y-You want me to do what!? Lotta: Listen, nag the guy real good fer 'bout five hours and I guarantee he'll give it back. Phoenix: Why don't you do your own dirty work...? Present Anything Phoenix: Um, would you please take a look at this? Lotta: Nope. Sorry. No can do. Only thing I wanna see is a steamin' hand towel. Phoenix: Um, what? A steaming hand towel...? Lotta: Need one for my eyes. Today just ain't a good day for my eyes to be lookin' at stuff. Phoenix: (How convenient! Maybe I'll have to use that one next time you show me something!) After clearing all Talk options: Lotta: ... Well, I reckon it's time for me to get going. A tabloid photographer without a camera is just a \"tabloid\", huh. Phoenix: Umm... Yeah, I guess so. Lotta: Keep yerself together out there, ya hear!? I'm comin' to see ya in court tomorrow. Phoenix: O-OK, I'll see you then... Lotta: And you too there, little 'un. Keep up the good work, OK? Pearl: OK! Lotta: Don't be picky about yer food, now. Pearl: OK! Lotta: And make sure ya do all yer homework, ya hear? Pearl: OK! Lotta: And if you happen to find yerself a camera, make sure ya bring it right to me, ya-- Phoenix: Would you please just leave already!? Examine Door on left Phoenix: There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". (I wonder what EXACTLY happened in the room behind this door...? Even now, no one really has any idea...) March 22Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room ???: ... Ooongh... Oooonnngh... Ooongh... Oooonnngh... Pearl: M-M-Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Wh-What is that otherworldly, ghastly moaning...!? ???: ... Ooonnnn... Oooo... Nnnghff... Ghfff... Pearl: I... I hate evil ghosts... Waaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: I don't think it's a ghost... Maybe it's a demon!? ???: E-Excuse me!? Watch who you're calling a demon, brat! Pearl: Aaaah! Phoenix: Zoinks! It's the alien!! Oldbag: Who are you calling an alien!? Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Phoenix: Oh, it's just you, Ms. Oldbag. What are you doing here? Oldbag: What is wrong with young'uns today!? I came down here to pay my respects to my poor Juan, and you're disturbing me! Examine Bedroom Pearl: So that's a bed... Phoenix: Yup. It's big, but it's a bed. Pearl: Aaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft! Phoenix: (How easily children are entertained.) Floor near guitar case Phoenix: Bottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant. Pearl: These glass shards... Phoenix: They're probably from the glass vase Ms. Andrews knocked over. Guitar case Pearl: So, the Nickel Samurai's costume was in here? Phoenix: Yeah. Pearl: I can't believe Mr. Corrida went so far, just to say bad things about Mr. Engarde... Phoenix: W-Well, it was a \"press conference\", so he had to go in costume. Pearl: But weren't Mr. Engarde and Mr. Corrida friends? Phoenix: They weren't friends. They couldn't be friends because they were rivals. Pearl: So, a \"rival\" is someone who is a \"strong enemy\"!? Phoenix: (Pearls is really fired up over this... And I don't have an answer for her.) Wine glass Phoenix: It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it. Pearl: Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much. Phoenix: There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from. Talk Night of the murder Phoenix: Please talk to me about the night of the murder just one more time. Oldbag: I talked about it plenty at the trial! I was fooled, tricked... DECEIVED by that fraud of a photographer and her note! She was loitering around here with that imbecilic look on her face! Pearl: \"With that imbecilic look on her face\"... OK, got it. Oldbag: N-Now hold on a second there you little pipsqueak! If you're going to take notes, at least make me sound better than that! Pearl: Oh, alright. Phoenix: (Now I've seen everything...) Oldbag: But you know, I was working that night too, doing my job, minding my own business. So it's not like I had time to waste standing around here the whole night. Memories of Corrida Phoenix: I was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about Mr. Corrida. Oldbag: He was the most popular star, you know... Especially where it counts -- in my book! Phoenix: But I heard that he was lagging behind in the polls against Mr. Engarde... Oldbag: Um, w-well, that's just a recent thing. Bad luck and all that, you know. But! He was going to become an even bigger star than he used to be! Look! Just look at this mountain of presents! It's a show of the mountain of feelings all his fans had for him! Phoenix: Yeah, the mountain is pretty big, and certainly nothing to shake a stick at. Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Hm? What is it, Pearls? Pearl: The presents. They're all bears... right? Phoenix: (She's got a point... There isn't a single thing here that isn't a bear...) Presents (appears after \"Memories of Corrida\") Phoenix: All of Mr. Corrida's presents from his fans seem to be... bears... Oldbag: Oh, that's because you can't think of Juan without thinking about bears! Pearl: Bears...? Why bears? Oldbag: You don't know!? When my dear Juan was training, he fought barehanded with a bear. He refused to give in and let the bear win, but after the fight, they became friends. Pearl: Wow... What a heartwarming story. Oldbag: Look, it's just like in those young people's dramas. I can see those two tuckered out, down by a river going, \"Heh... You... You sure can fight...\" \"You too, bub. You too.\" Phoenix: D-Did all that really happen? Oldbag: It's in his biography, bub. Phoenix: (What a load of crock!) Oldbag: So ever since then, fans have been giving him bears as presents. Phoenix: Yeah... Nice... Bears... After clearing all Talk options and visiting Living Room: *GROOOOOOOOOOWL!* I'm Uncle Bear, and I say it's \"bearly\" 8 o'clock! Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What is that infernal racket!? Oldbag: It's one of the presents going off. Sounds like it's already 8 PM. Way past your bedtime! Phoenix: Urk... That startled me! I thought I was going to die for a second... Pearl: Eight PM... That's the time when the award ceremony ended that night, remember? Phoenix: (Time sure flies... Hard to believe it's been two days since the ceremony...) ...*beep beep beep*... Phoenix: (The transceiver!) ...*beep*... Phoenix: Hello!? Hello!? ???: ...This is not a phone. Phoenix: Maya! How is Maya!? You haven't hurt her, have you!? ???: ...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Wright.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! ???: I have heard the news. So it would seem my present did you no good... Pearl: N-Noooo! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa! Phoenix: One more day! Please! All I ask is for one more day! I... I'll get a not guilty verdict for sure this time! Please... ???: ... I suppose if I must. I need that acquittal more than anything else, after all. Phoenix: ...Please... Please let Maya say something! I want to hear she's alright! ???: Alright... hissssss... then... hisssssss... ssssssssss... ssss... a little... sssssss... Phoenix: (What is with this static all of a sudden...!) Hello!? Hello!? ???: It seems... ssssss... hisss... sssss... bad... sssssss... hisssssssssss... ssssssssss... connect...sssssssssssss... Phoenix: (Dammit! Did the transceiver just suddenly break...!?) ???: ssssssssss... 'll excuse me... hisssssssssssssssss... ...*beep*... Pearl: Wh-What happened...? Phoenix: I don't know. All of a sudden, it became nothing but static. Pearl: Aaaah... Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya! Phoenix: (Why did the transceiver suddenly break like that...? I should probably have an electronics expert look at it... The sooner the better!) March 22Wright & Co. Law Offices Gumshoe: Hey! Welcome back, pal! I thought I'd make you a little something for dinner. Phoenix: Th...That's nice... Thanks. Gumshoe: A rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is... (Changed from [It's a rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is...] in the original release) Phoenix: I'm sorry you went through all the trouble to cook, but I don't have the time to eat. Gumshoe: Oops... Looks like you don't have a can opener, pal. (Changed from [Oh, hey... You don't have a can opener here, pal.] in the original release) Phoenix: (You've got to be kidding... And here I thought he had already whipped something up.) Gumshoe: Oh, I know! There is one way I know how to be helpful! Ask me about anything you want, pal! Go ahead! Phoenix: (Well, since he's here and offering... I wonder what I should try asking him about?) Talk Electromagnetic interference (appears after correctly presenting Radio Transceiver) Leads to: \"Um... So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...?\" Present Radio Transceiver (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room) Gumshoe: The transceiver...? Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! You should ask Mr. Scruffy Detective about that thing. Gumshoe: What thing? Phoenix: Oh yeah! This thing just up and broke all of a sudden! Gumshoe: It... It broke, pal? Phoenix: When I was talking to the kidnapper, it just suddenly broke into static... Look, it sounded like this. ...*beep*... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: I don't hear any static, pal. Phoenix: H-Huh?? Pearl: Maybe it fixed itself? Phoenix: That's strange... I'm sure it was making a loud static noise. Gumshoe: Hmm... Maybe... Phoenix: Maybe what? Gumshoe: Maybe it was \"electromagnetic interference\", pal. Phoenix: \"Electromagnetic interference\"? Picture Card Phoenix: Oh yeah! Do you know about this card? Gumshoe: Card? Phoenix: Edgeworth, for some reason, went pale the instant he saw this card. Gumshoe: Hey, I know what this is, pal! Phoenix: You do? Gumshoe: No matter what way you look at it, I'd say it's a picture of a shell. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Um, that's it? Gumshoe: Oh yeah! That's right! Mr. Edgeworth really likes those cooked snail things. Um, what are they called again...? \"Escargot\" or something like that...? Pearl: Mr. Nick! I think we just solved the mystery of why Mr. Edgeworth's face turned pale, right!? Phoenix: (As I suspected, Gumshoe has no clue...) Phoenix: Um... So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...? Gumshoe: It's something that happens when a radio wave gets mixed up with another signal, pal. Phoenix: Oh, when you put it that way... Pearl: I don't understand what you're talking about... Gumshoe: Like for example, when a cell phone goes off next to a computer screen, the stuff on the screen gets kinda fuzzy and starts acting funny, right? Pearl: Huh? ...\"Kom-pu-ter\"? Gumshoe: ... Um, it's like when you use the dryer next to the TV, and the screen starts looking weird. Pearl: O-Oh, yes, the TV does do that! Hmm... Oh, so that's what you're talking about! Phoenix: (She seems amazingly happy at being able to understand this...) Gumshoe: So the room you were in when that interference to the transceiver happened... There's gotta be something there that's sending out very strong radio waves, pal! Something like... Hmm... Like a listening device or something. Phoenix: Ah! Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of that! Where were you when it happened? Pearl: We were in Mr. Corrida's room... The scene of the murder! Gumshoe: What!? That's it! I'm going to sneak into the precinct and get a bug sweeper! I'll meet you at the crime scene later, alright pal!? Phoenix: Ah, wait! Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Oh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah! Pearl: We should be going too, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Alright, let's go! Examine Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night! After clearing \"Electromagnetic interference\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices: March 22Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room Gumshoe: Hey! You're finally here, pal! Phoenix: S-Sorry to keep you waiting. Pearl: Do you have the... um... \"bug sweeper\"? Gumshoe: Um, well, you see... I got busted trying to sneak in, pal. Then suddenly, I'm staring at the precinct doors. ...From the outside, I mean. So yeah... I couldn't get one of the police bug sweepers... Phoenix: ... What do you mean you couldn't get it!? We need that item! Gumshoe: Hey, hey, calm down, pal. I didn't say I didn't get one, just not the police's. Pearl: Wow... So this is a \"bug sweeper\"... Phoenix: It looks a little... broken. Gumshoe: Hey, this was made when I was in elementary school, pal. Phoenix: Oh? By who? Gumshoe: Me, of course! Ah, seeing this sure brings back memories... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: Hey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little beat up... (Changed from [Hey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little run down...] in the original release) But I put my heart and soul into building this puppy here! Pearl: Your heart and soul...? Gumshoe: It'll work! Trust me, pal, it'll do the job! But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: But you can't set the sensitivity... So it's going to beep at anything that gives off electromagnetic waves. Pearl: But isn't it better that way? Gumshoe: Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! Well, anyway, since I brought it all this way, might as well give it a whirl, right pal? Phoenix: (I'm getting that sinking feeling again...) Gumshoe: OK, now I'll tell you how to use this baby! There's a listening device or some other sort of bug hidden in this room, pal. Pearl: So we're going to find it, right? Gumshoe: Right. Now, first, let's turn the sweeper on. Next, move the sweeper around to give the room a real thorough lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the sweeper and take a real good look around the room with it, pal.] in the original release) The sweeper'll let you know how strong of a signal it's picking up, so keep an eye on it, OK? (Changed from [You can see how strong the radio waves are in an area by looking at the CHECK gauge.] in the original release) Once you find something that's giving off a lot of radio waves... (Changed from [Once you find something that's giving off strong waves, the gauge will change...] in the original release) ...press [the A Button / Enter] to lock on to it. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the thing a long hard stare.] in the original release) There's a lot of things here that's going to give off radio waves, so let's take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Alright! I'm going to go stand outside and keep an eye out. Give me a yell if you find the bug. Got it, pal!? Bug sweeper Calculator Phoenix: It's a plain old calculator. Pearl: It says \"50\" on it. Maybe he was calculating his allowance? Phoenix: (A whole 50 cents?? Um, maybe if he was a spirit medium...) Dryer Phoenix: And here we have a dryer... Nothing unusual here, I think. Pearl: A dryer...? Oh! if you use it next to a TV, it'll make the screen look all weird right? Phoenix: ...Y-Yeah. Pearl: And when that happens, it's called \"electromagnetic interference\", right!? Phoenix: Hey, good memory Pearls! Pearl: I will never forget it for the rest of my life! Clock bear Phoenix: Well, it certainly looks like an alarm clock. Pearl: What's wrong? Why do you look troubled? Phoenix: I just can't imagine the listening device being inside this alarm clock. It just, um, sort of reminded me of something that happened a long time ago... Pearl: Oh... Phoenix: Well, anyway, it looks like the listening device isn't in here. Box next to clock bear Pearl: Wow, there's a really delicious loaf of bread in here! Phoenix: Looks like it's been on \"keep warm\" all this time since the murder. Pearl: Well, Mr. Scruffy Detective always says, \"Got to keep the trail and crime scene warm.\" Phoenix: (I think the \"keep warm\" in that case is a little more metaphorical...) Video camera Pearl: What's this? Phoenix: It's a small video camera. ...No listening device in this gizmo. Pearl: Everyone's trying to make everything smaller and smaller lately, aren't they Mr. Nick? Phoenix: That's what it seems like. Pearl: But! I want to grow bigger and bigger! Phoenix: (Well, eating only vegetables isn't going to help you there. You have to eat meat too...) Remote control Phoenix: It's the TV's remote control. But it doesn't look like the listening device is in here. Pearl: Um, so I was thinking... I wonder if a TV remote works on other things... Like... Could I make you change your expressions like TV channels? Zap! Phoenix: H-Hey! (Hmm, but if I could... Ooh, the people I would give the ol' mute button to!) Well, I don't think it's going to work on me... Why don't we try it on Maya tomorrow, OK? Pearl: ... OK! Laptop Phoenix: There's no listening device in that notebook computer, huh. Pearl: Umm... What's a \"notebook computer\"...? Phoenix: ... Do you know what a \"notebook\" is? Pearl: Yes! It's a small book with paper that you can write on! ...So? Phoenix: Well, that thing is like a notebook in a way. It's basically a small laptop. Pearl: Umm... Mr. Nick... What's a \"laptop\"...? Refrigerator Pearl: This is a... a refrigerator, right? Phoenix: I really don't think the listening device is in something like this. Pearl: Because it's filled with nothing but healty vegetable juices, right!? Phoenix: Uh, yeah, sure. (What does that have to do with listening devices?) Coffee pot Pearl: What's this? It sort of looks like a hot water pot, but... Phoenix: Oh, well, it's kind of like a hot water pot, I guess. But instead of hot water, coffee comes out. Pearl: Really!? Th-This pot can do that!? ... Um, is there a pot that orange juice comes out of...? Phoenix: I don't think there's anything like that, Pearls. Sorry. Water pot Pearl: Oh, the water in this hot water pot has run out! I'll go get more water for it! Phoenix: O-OK. Sounds good. (Looks like she's forgotten all about looking for the listening device...) Large bear near coffee machine Leads to: \"This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right?\" Air conditioner Phoenix: Well, the listening device isn't in the air conditioner. Pearl: Aah! Yuck! This air filter is covered in dust and dirt... Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Pearl: ... Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's wash it! Phoenix: (I wonder if being a neat freak makes even the tiniest dust bunny look colossal...?) Pearl: ...What? Phoenix: O-Oh, nothing. TV Phoenix: I don't really think the listening device is in the TV of all places. Pearl: Looks like the TV was left on, and it's now showing an old samurai movie. Phoenix: Yeah. This channel plays all sorts of international movies, as well as domestic ones. Pearl: You know, every time I watch one of these old movies, I always think, \"Wow, these Japanese stars are really good at English!\" Phoenix: ...Um, yeah. Pearl: When I grow up, I want to study Japanese! Phoenix: (I should probably keep my mouth shut here, and not destroy her dream...) Lamps Phoenix: Lamp, check. Listening device... nope. Pearl: There are a lot of lamps in this room, aren't there Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. Pearl: And they're all on. You shouldn't do that, Mr. Nick. Don't you know that's wasteful? Phoenix: ...Ah, yeah... I'll be more conscientious from now on. Sorry. Cell phone Phoenix: A cell phone... Nope, no bugs in here. Pearl: A \"cell phone\"...? Phoenix: Wh-What!? Don't tell me you don't know what a cell phone is! Pearl: ...I'm sorry. I've never seen one before... Phoenix: (Now that she mentions it, my cell phone couldn't get any reception while I was staying in Kurain Village... And Pearls has never lived outside of that village, so... Well, I guess I can't say it's impossible to live without one...) Landline phone Phoenix: Well, the phone is the most common place for a \"listening device\", I'd say. But, let's take the receiver apart first before we get ahead of ourselves here. Pearl: Wow, you know a lot about electronics, don't you Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, I know tons. Especially when it comes to taking them apart. It's my specialty. (I'll leave the fixing part up to Gumshoe...) Pearl: So...? Is there a \"listening device\" in there? Phoenix: ...No. (And I really thought it had to be in the phone too...) Bear between the two sofas Pearl: Ah, what a lovely bear... *GROOOOOOOOOOOOWL!* Pearl: AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! Phoenix: Ah, this must be one of those fancy bear-shaped toy robots. Pearl: I-It's a robot!? It's a REAL robot!? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, it's a real one. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Pearl: H-How many horse-powers is it? How many horsies!? Phoenix: Horsies...? ... Phoenix: Um... Well, look, it's a bear, so... uh... Pearl: Um... Radio Pearl: The radio is on and playing something. Oh! It's \"Kids' Question Corner\"! \"Professor! Professor! Why is the Earth round?\" Pearl: ... Yes, why is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... Why don't you listen to the radio program a little more, Pearls? Pearl: This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right? It's the biggest one I have ever seen! Gumshoe: Hey! So did you guys find it yet? The listening device, I mean... Pearl: No, not yet. But this bear's eye is... Gumshoe: Let's see, let's see... A perfectly normal stuffed bear with some really strong radio waves... Sounds like you found the device to me, pal. Let's dig this big fella's eye out and see what we've got. Pearl: N-No! You can't! Such... Such a violent act... Gumshoe: Oomph! *rip!* Pearl: Noooooooooo! Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Th-That's! Gumshoe: It's a miniature camera... And it looks like there's more. There's a... transmitter, and a timer. Phoenix: A whattawhatta-mitter? Gumshoe: A transmitter, pal. Pearl: Oh... Is this more of that \"high tech\" stuff...? Talk Camera Phoenix: So this tiny thing is a camera...? Gumshoe: Yup. It's a pinhole CCD camera, pal. It's a small, high-grade video camera mostly used in security systems. Phoenix: So it's a video camera... Gumshoe: It runs on a battery, which comes with it in a set. Phoenix: But... there's no video tape in this camera... Gumshoe: This is only the camera part here, pal. The tape recorder with the tape inside it is somewhere else. Pearl: Somewhere else? Gumshoe: The footage is changed into radio waves and then it's sent to that recorder. Pearl: So... It's sort of like a TV broadcast, isn't it? Gumshoe: Hey, you know, you're right! Spy Camera added to the Court Record. Camera (subsequent times) Phoenix: So this tiny thing is a camera...? Gumshoe: Yup. It's a pinhole CCD camera, pal.

Gumshoe: The footage is changed into radio waves and then it's sent to that recorder. Pearl: So... It's sort of like a TV broadcast, isn't it? Gumshoe: Hey, you know, you're right! Transmitter Phoenix: So... what is a \"transmitter\"? Gumshoe: It's a device that sends footage the camera took to a specific destination. It's like a video version of a listening device, pal. Phoenix: It looks like it's attached to a small, clock-like thing... Gumshoe: Oh, that's a timer, pal. You can set it to turn the camera on and record at a certain time with it. Pearl: You can set it for a certain time...? Gumshoe: Yup. Let's see... This looks like it was set to start at 8 PM and go for one hour. Phoenix: Eight PM? (That was the time the award ceremony ended!) Gumshoe: There's no date set, so it's been recording every night, I'd guess. Pearl: M-Mr. Detective! How long has this bear been here...? Gumshoe: Um, I'm pretty sure it's been here since the night of the murder. Pearl: Then... Then maybe... Gumshoe: Maybe this camera caught the murder on tape! Phoenix: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: And if you think about the angle the bear is at... It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal! Transmitter added to the Court Record. Transmitter (subsequent times) Phoenix: So... what is a \"transmitter\"? Gumshoe: It's a device that sends footage the camera took to a specific destination.

Gumshoe: And if you think about the angle the bear is at... It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal! Stuffed bear Pearl: So there was a camera... in this bear's eye... Phoenix: And it was disguised as a present. Gumshoe: And I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal. It's pretty big, so it stands out pretty well in my mind. Phoenix: But... who gave Mr. Corrida this present? Gumshoe: I, ah, don't know, pal. But! This means that someone out there's got a video of what happened here that night! Pearl: Isn't there any way we can find out who that person is? Gumshoe: It's impossible, pal. Radio waves can be sent almost anywhere, so there's no real way to find out... Pearl: Oh... *sniffle* Phoenix: (Is there really no way to find out...?) Stuffed Bear added to the Court Record. Stuffed bear (subsequent times) Pearl: So there was a camera... in this bear's eye... Phoenix: And it was disguised as a present. Gumshoe: And I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal. It's pretty big, so it stands out pretty well in my mind.

Pearl: Oh... *sniffle* Phoenix: (Is there really no way to find out...?) Present Picture Card Gumshoe: So... the assassin's name is Shelly de Killer? Phoenix: Yeah. Gumshoe: And because he's \"Shelly\", that's why he leaves a \"shell\" card? Phoenix: Yes. Gumshoe: ... Ho ho ho ho! Oh, that's great. But you know, no matter how strange I may seem, at least my jokes don't make you cringe. Right, pal? Phoenix: (Umm... Yeah, you keep on thinking that...) Spy Camera Pearl: It's a really tiiiiny camera. Gumshoe: A camera this size lasts about 3 hours with a fresh battery pack, pal. Phoenix: But what would something like this be doing in...? Gumshoe: Well, I'd say taking a secret video of the murder. Phoenix: (Which means... Someone knew there was going to be a murder here!) Transmitter Gumshoe: This device looks like it was made by the criminal themselves. If it's only sending images, then I'd say it'd last about 80 hours, pal. Pearl: You know a lot about these things, don't you Mr. Detective? Is spying on people a hobby of yours...? Gumshoe: Well, no... I mean... You're making me embarrassed, putting me on the spot like this. Phoenix: (Why should he be embarrassed? Is there something I'm not getting here...?) Stuffed Bear Pearl: The bear is really lovely, isn't it? It's so soft and fuzzy, and the face is really well-made... Phoenix: (Well, I guess when you compare it to all the other presents, it is well-made.) Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think the bear itself is a clue to this case at all. After clearing all Talk options: Gumshoe: ... ...I got it! Phoenix: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: Hey, pal. Let me borrow this mini camera for a bit! Phoenix: Wh-What are you going to do? Gumshoe: I'm going to go around to the electronic shops and see if I can find out who bought this! Phoenix: B-But that's impossible! I mean, it's already 9 PM! Gumshoe: Leave it to me! Even if I have to search all night, I'll find your man, pal! Spy Camera and Transmitter given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Oh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah! Pearl: ...He's gone. Phoenix: ...Yeah. Pearl: But Mr. Scruffy Detective sure is a nice man. He's pushing himself so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake... ???: It's a mystery how you always manage to do things in the most inefficient ways, Wright. (Changed from [...You always manage to do things in the most ineffective ways.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Ack!) Edgeworth: You'll have to excuse me. I heard your conversation just now. Phoenix: E-Edgeworth! What are you doing here!? Edgeworth: A rescue team has been created and deployed. I can't say I'm optimistic... but we have to move forward, one step at a time. Phoenix: I-I see... Thanks. Edgeworth: Don't thank me yet. We still have to find her. Pearl: ... Edgeworth: Hmm... So, there was a spy camera hidden inside this stuffed animal, huh? You are one lucky man, Wright. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: Do you know this stuffed bear, little girl? Pearl: Um... I have no idea! Edgeworth: Hmph... Of course not. The maker of this bear is a very expensive, luxury brand from overseas. It's completely hand-made, and only a small number of these are exported here. (Changed from [It's completely hand-made and there are very few that are exported here.] in the original release) Phoenix: Wh-What? Edgeworth: The camera and transmitter that scatterbrained detective took with him are dead ends. Things like those can be bought anywhere... However, this bear is different. By tracking how it got into this country, this bear can tell us who the buyer is. Pearl: C-Can you really do that!? Mr. Nick, can he really? Phoenix: W-Well, I guess so... Edgeworth: Hmm... It's 9 PM. I think I can still make it in time. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: I'll be taking this for now. I'm sure you have other things you have to do. Stuffed Bear snatched up by Edgeworth. Edgeworth: See you soon, Wright. Phoenix: W-Wait! Edgeworth: What? Phoenix: Why are you doing this...? Edgeworth: ... I have no interest in explaining myself to someone who cannot comprehend. But besides that, Wright. Until court reconvenes tomorrow, you should concern yourself with this question: \"Who was the person that murdered Juan Corrida?\" Phoenix: The \"real killer\"... Edgeworth: Do you really still think it was Adrian Andrews? Phoenix: To be honest... I don't know anymore. Edgeworth: ... You still have a little time left... Find the truth, Wright. Everything begins with the truth. Phoenix: (Juan Corrida's real killer... Ms. Andrews' past... The kidnapper whose sole condition is an acquittal for Mr. Engarde... And... this card. Shelly de Killer...) ...Maya. The only way I can save you now, is to find all the answers to this case tonight! I don't understand what your real intentions are, Edgeworth... but as you said, all I can do for now is find the truth! To be continued. March 22, 9:14 PMGatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room Pearl: It's past 9:00 PM already, isn't it? I wonder... I wonder if Mr. Edgeworth has already found Mystic Maya...? Phoenix: (These things take time. I'd say probably not...) The police are professionals, Pearls. They'll find her, so don't you worry. And if we can win a not guilty verdict tomorrow... then everything will be OK. Pearl: Y-You're right... ... Talk The real killer Phoenix: So the real person who killed Mr. Corrida was... Pearl: That assassin... Mr. Shelly de Killer, right? Phoenix: And the card Ms. Andrews found at the crime scene seems to be proof of that. But if that's the case, then a new question comes to mind. Who was the one that hired De Killer to begin with? Who is his client? Pearl: You mean... Who asked for the murder...? Phoenix: That person didn't want to dirty their own hands in blood, but whoever this client is, they're still a killer. Pearl: ... The assassin's client Pearl: Who... Who could have hired the assassin? Do you think it was Ms. Andrews...? Phoenix: (I wonder... But if she was the client... then why go through the effort to stab the knife into the corpse herself...?) Pearl: But if Ms. Andrews wasn't the client... Then... No, it can't be... Phoenix: (...Matt Engarde himself...?) Was it Matt? (appears after \"The real killer\" and \"The assassin's client\") Pearl: If Mr. Engarde really did hire the assassin... Phoenix: Then he is not innocent at all. Far from it, he would be guilty of the crime. Pearl: B-But it can't be Mr. Engarde, right!? I mean, when we first talked with him... Phoenix: ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida? Engarde: ... Alright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK? Phoenix: (I didn't see any Psyche-Locks at that time... Actually... That reminds me...) Pearl: Did you remember something, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, something Ms. Andrews said at the trial today. She said something interesting. Something interesting (appears after \"Was it Matt?\") Pearl: Um... So what is this \"interesting thing\"? Phoenix: Oh, that's right. You didn't hear it, did you Pearls? Andrews: Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway. Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed! Pearl: Mr. Engarde's \"secret\"...!? Wh-What is this secret...? Phoenix: I don't know yet. But for now, let's think about it this way. Mr. Corrida was going to reveal this \"secret\". That means... Mr. Engarde had plenty of motive to have Mr. Corrida silenced. ... (Which means we have to meet with Mr. Engarde. There's no way around it now.) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: I... I believe in your lawyer powers, Mr. Nick. I know you can bring us a miracle. Phoenix: (I'm guessing by \"miracle\", she means a not guilty verdict... And she wouldn't be wrong either. It will take a miracle to pull this one off.) Radio Transceiver Pearl: Why... Why did the kidnapper have to take Mystic Maya...? Why couldn't he have taken me instead!? Phoenix: Stop it, Pearls! Don't say things like that! If that had happened, then Maya would be hurting, I'm sure of it. Just like how you are hurting now, Pearls. Pearl: Y-You're right... Maya Fey profile Pearl: One more day... Phoenix: Yeah... If we can bring the trial to its end, she'll be back. Don't worry. Pearl: I decided I won't cry anymore, Mr. Nick. You're so brave and holding strong for Mystic Maya, so I have to do the same. Pearl Fey profile Pearl: If only I had studied harder during my training... I could be a bigger help to you, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Ah, don't worry about it. Really. Pearls, you're doing a great job... Pearl: Mr. Nick! Is there a waterfall around here!? I feel that I must be made new under the rushing spring waters! Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... The only body of water around here is a lake. Pearl: Oh... Thanks anyway... Dick Gumshoe profile Pearl: This is the first time I've ever met someone who loves to eat instant noodles. Phoenix: (Something tells me Gumshoe isn't eating them because he genuinely likes them, but...) Pearl: He's working so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake... I'm going to get him lots and lots of instant noodles as a thank your present! Juan Corrida profile Pearl: Um... Is it really that important to be the Master of all the Stars? So important that you try to find your friends' weaknesses, and then expose them...? Phoenix: I... I wouldn't know... Matt Engarde profile Pearl: I-Is it really alright for us to trust him? This person... Mr. Engarde...? Phoenix: ... (I-I don't know... I can't even answer that for myself. We have to go see him one more time! That's the only way to know for sure!) Security Lady profile Pearl: Um... I was wondering if that old lady is really a person from Earth. I mean, maybe she's really from waaaaaay out in outer space... Phoenix: Yeah, actually, I was thinking the same exact thing. She's too strange to be from Earth. Adrian Andrews profile Pearl: Why did Ms. Andrews... Why did she frame Mr. Engarde, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (She has some sort of grudge against Mr. Engarde... But why is that? That's something we still have to figure out...) Let's go ask her, OK? Celeste Inpax profile Pearl: This person was Ms. Andrews' mentor... And she... killed herself, right? Phoenix: (Right. And Mr. Corrida hid Ms. Inpax's suicide note... So to get it back, Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... But the thing is, where is that suicide note now?) March 22Gatewater HotelHallway Pearl: Wow, it's really getting late, isn't it Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. It's past 9:00 PM already. But we still have some things to prepare for tomorrow's trial. (There's still the matter of this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida held about Mr. Engarde... And Ms. Andrews' real intentions. These are two things I must know tonight!) Pearl: But aren't visiting hours over at the detention center? Phoenix: Hmm... I'm sure we'll think of something, Pearls. Don't you worry. March 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall Oldbag: ... Phoenix: Hey! Wait! Oldbag: What is it, whippersnapper!? All I know is nothing that has anything to do with you is ever good! Like just now. I was handed this strange device for who knows what reason. And I was told to use it to search the whole hotel. Phoenix: That's... the bug sweeper, isn't it? (The one Gumshoe made...) Oldbag: I don't know and frankly, I don't care. But the request came from Edgey-poo, so... Phoenix: Edgeworth...? Oldbag: And he said, Edgeworth: \"If you feel angry, direct your anger at that unsophisticated lawyer.\" Oldbag: So, I'm going to feel free to direct all my anger towards you! Phoenix: (Ugh... Gee, thanks a bundle, Edgeworth! What a pal you are!) Examine Tables at back Phoenix: They haven't cleaned up all the food yet. Oldbag: Don't you touch it without permission! I brought a lunch box today, so I could pack it. Pearl: Um... But... Hasn't the food been out for two days already? Oldbag: When it's in your stomach, it's all the same! Phoenix: (Wow, the digestive powers of an alien are wondrous...) Front table Pearl: I want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again... Phoenix: Yeah, me too... Pearl: Whenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot. Phoenix: Well, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast! Oldbag: My mind's like a steel trap, so I'm going to hold you to that! Phoenix: (I was NOT talking to you!) Talk Bug sweeper Oldbag: This is absolutely top secret, so you had better keep it to yourselves! I heard they found a spy camera hidden in one of the presents! Phoenix: Hmm, very interesting. Oldbag: I'm sure it was... you know... It was to catch poor Juan in the middle of a scandalous \"meeting\"! Pearl: \"Scandalous\"...? What's that? Oldbag: It means... Well, you know, that gossip that's been going around about my dear Juan. Phoenix: Oh... You mean that thing about Ms. Andrews. (But I'm sure she must've had some reason for getting close to Mr. Corrida...) Oldbag: I'll let you in on another secret, young'un. I know who planted that spy camera! It was that obnoxious, puffy-haired photographer girl! The nerve of some people! Spying on people by herself! As if I wouldn't want to see it for myself too! Phoenix: (Wow! The alien actually admitted her true intentions for a change!) Oldbag: I don't know what you're thinking exactly, but I can bet that it's nothing good!! Phoenix: (But I didn't say anything...) Juan and Adrian Oldbag: So you want to know about Juan and that manager, right? Actually, as I hear it, they were something of a refreshing pair, those two. Phoenix: Oh? Oldbag: I tell you, Juan really welcomed that manager with open arms, I heard. Pearl: That \"manager\"...? Who are you talking about? Oldbag: You don't know? That manager woman Juan had. It's a shame she killed herself, though... Phoenix: Oh, you're talking about Ms. Celeste Inpax... Ms. Andrews' mentor, right? Oldbag: Yes, yes, that's the one! That Celeste girl. She was supposed to get married, you know. Phoenix: M-Married? You mean... to Mr. Corrida? Oldbag: *sigh* Really, you young kids today don't know anything, do you? That girl Celeste killed herself three days after their marriage announcement! Phoenix: (Three days after their marriage announcement!? What in the...!?) Celeste's suicide (appears after \"Juan and Adrian\") Pearl: Why would Ms. Inpax want to kill herself!? She was going to get married! Oldbag: Well, that's because... she was thrown away, you see, by Juan. Phoenix: What!? Pearl: B-But... They were going to get married, right? They promised each other, right? Oldbag: They held a grand announcement session... But... Three days later... Juan suddenly cancelled their marriage. Phoenix: I-Is that true? Oldbag: It was in the weekly magazines. Pearl: B-But why!? Why did he do that!? Oldbag: That was not in the magazines, unfortunately. Phoenix: ...I see. Oldbag: That night after Juan called off the wedding, that manager, Celeste, killed herself. Phoenix: How terrible... Pearl: I wonder what happened between those two...? March 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby Phoenix: On that night, there must've been at least a few hundred people here. Hmm... I guess the police are done with their questioning and investigating. It looks like things here in the lobby have finally calmed down. Examine Second floor Phoenix: A lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. When the murder happened, it was abuzz with people running back and forth... But now since things have quieted down, it actually feels more eerie than before. March 22Engarde MansionLiving Room Phoenix: It looks like no one is around... Pearl: Um, what happened to that person with the stuffed teddy face...? Phoenix: (Oh, she must mean that butler with the stitches in his face.) Pearl: Shoooooe! Shoe: Meow. Pearl: Oh, there you are. I guess you're still awake, huh Shoe? Shoe: Meow. Pearl: Hee hee, come on, let's play. Phoenix: (I wonder if that butler, Mr. Doe, is already asleep or not...) March 22Wright & Co. Law Offices Pearl: It doesn't look like Mr. Scruffy Detective is here. Phoenix: Well, he's out there with that camera asking around at all the electronic stores. Pearl: Then, I'll make some salad for him for dinner. Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls really appreciates what Gumshoe is doing for us...) Pearl: ...Um, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Hm? Yes? Pearl: Where is the lettuce? Phoenix: ...I don't think I've ever bought lettuce before. Pearl: ... Aww, I guess I have to give up on making a salad, then. Phoenix: (Guess the lack of lettuce is kind of a problem.) Examine Charley the plant Pearl: Oh! I'll water it! Phoenix: Ah, it's OK... Gumshoe already gave it more than plenty earlier... Pearl: ...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...? Phoenix: (Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...) Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh, I'll wipe it some more and make it super shiny! ...The wiping cloth... Where are you, Mr. wiping cloth...? Phoenix: It's fine. Really. If you wipe it any more, it'll be so shiny I'll be using it as a mirror. March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Visiting hours ended a few hours ago. Looks like we're not going to get a chance to talk with Mr. Engarde tonight... Pearl: B-But... Isn't what we have to ask very important? Phoenix: (Yeah, but I don't think that matters to the guard...) Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Visiting hours ended hours ago, so what's the camera watching over now? Pearl: Maybe it's watching the Mr. Policeman who's standing over there. Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think that's it...) Guard Phoenix: Visiting hours ended hours ago, so what's he watching over now? Pearl: Maybe he did something bad and he's standing there as punishment. Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think that's it...) March 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Pearl: It feels sort of tense in here, doesn't it Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (Yeah, it does. I wonder if something happened...?) Chief: You're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, right? Phoenix: Ah, yes sir. Chief: Well, we've finally found just the person we've been looking for. A real decisive witness. Phoenix: A \"decisive witness\"? You mean for Mr. Engarde's case? Chief: We're taking the witness's statement right now. Gotta hand it to Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: (What's Edgeworth up to now...?) Pearl: Wh-Who is this witness? Chief: I think you know this person quite well, Mr. Lawyer. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: (Between the kidnapper's demand and now this... I can't see any way to win here!) Chief: Oh, yeah... Mr. Edgeworth wanted me to tell you something. Phoenix: He did? Chief: Even though visiting hours are long over at the detention center, he wanted me to grant you special permission, so there you go. Pearl: What!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release) Chief: I've already called them so they know. Go on, go talk to your heart's content. Phoenix: Thank you very much. Pearl: This is such good news, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (\"Go talk to your heart's content\"? It sounds like the police are pretty sure they have tomorrow's trial in the bag.) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"It seems as though my true face has been revealed... I was an elite businessman who made deals with the entire world! I was the young successor and CEO of a colossal corporate conglomeration! But my real self is that of a regular everyday policeman!\" Phoenix: ... Stop doing image training, and get yourself out there in the field!! Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: Whaaat!? \"The real killer in the Corrida murder is an assassin...\"!? This must be someone's idea of a joke. I can't believe this garbage! Phoenix: (Have a little more faith in your own subordinates!) Blue Badger Chief: This mascot here is the \"Blue Badger\". I made him, you know. I'm finally gonna show him off to the Chief of Police tomorrow. Phoenix: Wow, that's really something. Chief: You have no idea how much time and effort I invested into him to get this far... But my hopes for this little guy go far beyond just this precinct, yessiree. I'll get him deployed to every precinct in the nation. Just you wait. Pearl: I wish you luck, sir. After clearing \"Something interesting\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room, clearing \"Celeste's suicide\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Hotel Lobby, and visiting Criminal Affairs Dept.: March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (I'm sure they must have transferred Ms. Andrews here by now... So that means that both Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews are in this detention center. Now then, whose story do I want to hear?) Matt Engarde Engarde: Dude! It's Mr. Wright! I hope you can get me off the hook tomorrow. I'm counting on you! Phoenix: I... hope so too... (Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me by saying... (Changed from [Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me and said...] in the original release) that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that the assassin's client is... (Changed from [that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that assassin's client is...] in the original release) this man... Matt Engarde...) Engarde: What's wrong? Phoenix: ...Mr. Engarde. There is something I must know with one hundred percent certainty. Engarde: Hmm, you seem kinda different. You're totally not like your usual lawyer dude self. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitor's the visitor's room. He's sleeping standing up. The night's pretty long, and he probably got tired. Hmm... I hope he doesn't fall over... Talk Matt's secret Phoenix: Um, about the \"press conference\"... Engarde: You mean the one where Juan was gonna dress up as the Nickel Samurai? Phoenix: Yeah. I heard a little more about it from Ms. Andrews. Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed! Engarde: ... Phoenix: Could you please fill me in on what this \"secret\" is? Please? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew this was coming...) Pearl: Mr. Nick? D-Don't tell me... Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks...) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock...] in the original release) Engarde: You said a \"secret\", right? But I don't have any idea what it is. Do you dude...? (Changed from [You said a 'secret', right? But you don't have any idea what it is, do you dude...?] in the original release) Matt's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: This is a very important matter! Please! You must tell me! What is this \"secret\"!? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Engarde: Hmm... Well... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult my lawyer, OK? Phone: ............ ...*beep*... Phoenix: H-Hello? This is Phoenix Wright. Engarde: Oh, hey Mr. Lawyer dude. Sorry, but you know dude, you totally don't have any idea. And I really didn't care at all about what Juan was up to, OK? Phone: ...*beep*... Engarde: So, it's like that. Phoenix: ... (Looks like I have no choice but to remove those Psyche-Locks...) Juan and Adrian Phoenix: Did you know about Mr. Corrida and Ms. Andrews' relationship...? Engarde: Well, it's all over the tabloids, dude. Ah, but I don't know any of the details, if that's what you mean. Look, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't care what Juan did with his life. Phoenix: Ms. Andrews... She had a purpose in mind when she started seeing Mr. Corrida. Her mentor was Mr. Corrida's manager... and Ms. Andrews was going to get Ms. Celeste Inpax's suicide note from him. Engarde: Celeste... Phoenix: Does that jog any memories...? Engarde: ... Dude, I suddenly just got totally hungry. You up for a pizza? My treat. Engarde: ... ... Pearl: Um... Mr. Nick? What's a \"pea-za\"? Is it a kind of pea, like green peas? Phoenix: Let's go eat one later, OK? Engarde: ...Argh, I got cut off by the pizza dude at the shop. Phoenix: That's too bad... Engarde: Well, how about we get our minds off of this topic and talk about something else, OK? Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde... Are you connected to Ms. Inpax's suicide in some way...?) Present Press Conference Ticket Engarde: That Juan... Posing as someone else and trying to hold a press conference...! And the person who set it all up was Adrian, wasn't it? Phoenix: That's what I heard. Engarde: Argh... I can't believe... Why would she do such a thing, dude!? Radio Transceiver Engarde: That's a very nice transceiver, dude. I'm kind of an expert in gadgety things... Phoenix: (Why does what he just said give me a sinking feeling?) Pearl: ? Guitar Case Engarde: His signature item was a guitar. Hah! I mean, dude, what kind of ninja carries a guitar!? Phoenix: Um, I'm not someone who would know... Engarde: Dude, it's such a kid thing to do. I mean, just my opinion and all. Phoenix: (Isn't your show a kid's show too?) Crime Photo Engarde: He was a bit of a talentless hack when he was alive... But who knew he could play dead so well? Wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: W-Well, that's because he really IS dead! Engarde: And quite pitifully indeed, yes? Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo Engarde: That Adrian... I never thought she'd go this far to frame me for the crime... I mean, what does she have against me? Dude, I don't get it. Phoenix: That's something I would like to know too. Do you have any ideas at all? Even the slightest clue? Engarde: Huh!? What!? Me!? D-Don't be silly, Mr. Lawyer dude! How am I supposed to know something like that? Suicide Report or Celeste Inpax profile Engarde: ... Phoenix: ...Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Dude, I know I asked you to be my lawyer and all... But I don't think I have to tell you anything and everything. Phoenix: Um... What do you mean by that? Engarde: It just means I don't have to tell you anything and everything, dude. Pearl: ... Attempted Suicide Report Phoenix: Um, about this... Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! You can't! Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Ms. Andrews said she doesn't want anyone to know about that, remember? Engarde: What's that? Phoenix: Oh, this? Um... Nothing. It's nothing, really. Picture Card Phoenix: (... I'm kind of scared to show him this card...) Engarde: What's wrong, dude? Phoenix: Oh, um... So about this picture card... Have you ever seen this before? Engarde: ...? Nope, never saw it before in my life, dude. Phoenix: (I don't think he's lying... Or is he...? Then again, he looked like he gasped just now... Maybe I'm seeing things...?) Engarde: ? Juan Corrida profile Engarde: It's true we debuted at the same time... so that's why people were always comparing us. But I totally didn't care what people were saying because he wasn't even close, dude. I mean, I won every contest we ever had, hands down! Adrian Andrews profile Engarde: I don't get it... Why would she want to frame me...? I mean, I've never done anything to her, dude... Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde sounds pretty sincere and he seems trustworthy... So I have to find out what Ms. Andrews' real intentions are!) John Doe profile Phoenix: About this person... Engarde: ...H-He's... Pearl: He is your butler, Mr. Doe, right? We met him at your mansion. Engarde: Oh... Yes, that's right. He's a pretty cool dude who can do lots of things. He takes real good care of me. Anything else Phoenix: Could you please take a look at this...? I know it may not seem important to you... Engarde: Well, if it's not important, then I'd rather be in bed. If I don't get my 12 hours of beauty sleep, my skin's gonna wrinkle up like a prune, dude. Pearl: You know, he's right Mr. Nick. Your skin's kind of drying up here and there. Phoenix: (I swear... After this case is over, I'm going to get lots and lots of sleep...) Adrian Andrews Andrews: ..Oh, it's you. Phoenix: I'm sorry to be visiting at such a late hour. But there are a few questions I absolutely have to ask you tonight. Andrews: Me? I thought your client was Matt. Phoenix: (I'm sure Ms. Andrews knows something... She can't be clueless about this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida had on Mr. Engarde...) Andrews: ... Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: I'd like to ask you about Matt Engarde, if you don't mind... Andrews: Mr. Wright... You still don't know, do you? The real him, I mean... Phoenix: ... You seem to bear a lot of resentment towards Mr. Engarde. If that's the case, then why did you become his manager? And why would you become intimate with his rival? Andrews: ... That... has nothing to do with this case. Nothing. Celeste Inpax Phoenix: About Ms. Celeste Inpax... Andrews: I had finally put her death behind me... And now, thanks to you, it's all come back to the surface. Phoenix: I... I'm sorry. Andrews: Yes, I was shocked by her suicide. And it's true that when I heard the rumor that Juan was the one who had hidden her suicide note, I began to draw close to him. I wanted to get her suicide note back... and to burn it. Phoenix: You wanted to \"burn it\"? But why? Andrews: I didn't want it to spread like just another piece of gossip. But... I never held any murderous intent towards Juan. I would never do something so stupid. Phoenix: (The suicide note, huh...? I wonder what it said?) Why frame him? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Celeste Inpax\") Phoenix: Why did you try to frame Mr. Engarde? Andrews: That's simple. Because he's the killer, that's why. Isn't it the duty of every good citizen to inform the police? Pearl: B-But... there had to be another way. Phoenix: The police are excellent at doing their job, so they'd figure it out, right? Andrews: Yes, they're so good that they couldn't figure out the real truth behind Celeste's death. Pearl: Ms. Andrews... Phoenix: Well, um, I know you're not the type of person to do something without a reason, so please, tell me why you did what you did... Andrews: ...Revenge. Pearl: Huh...? Did you say something just now...? 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (A Psyche-Lock, huh...) Andrews: Don't you understand yet? You're not my lawyer. To be honest, you're more like my enemy. Pearl: But... Phoenix: (I'm sure I just heard Ms. Andrews say, \"Revenge\".) Why frame him? (subsequent times) Phoenix: Why did you frame Mr. Engarde...? 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Andrews: Hmm, I wonder why...? I don't really know myself. When I realized what I was doing, I had already stabbed the knife into the body. Phoenix: (I'm almost sure that just now... Ms. Andrews muttered, \"Revenge\" to herself.) Present Press Conference Ticket Andrews: I was the one who organized the whole press conference. Juan wanted to deal the most damage possible to Matt's career. And that's why he was killed. It's quite simply a story of cause and effect, yes? Magazine Clipping Andrews: It appears to me that rumor was started by Juan himself. Phoenix: Mr. Corrida...? But... Andrews: I'm Matt's manager, remember. I think he wanted to embarrass Matt through his relationship with me. Pearl: But... But didn't Mr. Corrida like you...!? Andrews: There weren't any feelings of love between us. For me, it was about getting Celeste's suicide note... For him, it was about wounding Matt's pride. That's all it was. Pearl: That's... That's... Phoenix: (Poor Pearls is in shock. She sees just how cruel the world can really be.) Guitar Case Phoenix: So there was a Nickel Samurai costume inside of this case, correct? Andrews: Yes, there was. I even personally carried it here from the studio. I always thought it was such a childish thing to dress up and wear a costume like that, but I never thought that I would wind up using it myself that night. Wine Glass Andrews: When I was pouring that glass of juice... I honestly had no idea that Juan was dead... Pearl: I see... Andrews: I really am a terrible woman, aren't I? One moment, I'm thinking of looking after him, and the next, I'm stabbing him in the chest with a knife. Crime Photo Phoenix: About this photo... Andrews: The person who stabbed the body and opened the guitar case was me. Phoenix: And that was so you could get the Nickel Samurai's costume out so you could wear it...? Andrews: I thought I had executed that part quite well. But you showed me differently. You are a formidable lawyer, Mr. Wright. Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo Andrews: You know... There was only one thought running through my head at that time. \"With this, I can finally expose Matt's true nature to the world.\" Phoenix: (His \"true nature\"...? I wonder why she's saying that, but not telling me what his true nature is? If it were me, I think I'd be happy to finally get that kind of thing off my chest.) Suicide Report Andrews: I don't care what the reason was... It's unforgivable that he hid Celeste's suicide note. Phoenix: But you don't have any proof that she left a suicide note behind, right? Andrews: Celeste... She always believed there was a right way and a wrong way to do anything. She would have left a note. I... I wholly believe that. Attempted Suicide Report Andrews: S-Stop it! I don't want to remember the hopelessness and the despair I felt back then! Pearl: Hurry up and put that away, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: I-I'm so sorry! Picture Card Andrews: It was near Juan's dead body. I... I noticed it when I went to fill the glass. And then when I realized that Juan was dead... I completely panicked. That's when I must have unconsciously picked this card up and put it into my pocket. As for why...? I simply don't know. Will Powers profile Andrews: That's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be. Phoenix: (Urk... What a horrible thing to say...) Andrews: ...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright. Juan Corrida profile Andrews: He is a very prideful man... Or rather, was. He absolutely had to compete with Matt in everything, no matter what it was. He really was such an idiot. Pearl: Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: Well, I guess maybe all stars are like that. Never giving any thought to other people's feelings. Matt Engarde profile Andrews: ... Pearl: Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: That things have come to this... I have nothing left to say about that man.

She was a strong woman... She wouldn't kill herself over any old trifling matter... Pearl: S-So... You have some ideas of why she killed herself...? Andrews: Yes, I suppose... Anything else Phoenix: Um, I'd like to ask you about this... Andrews: I told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me. Phoenix: (Wow...

Mr. Wright! Please, you have to help me! Phoenix: (Uh oh...) M-Mr. Powers! Pearl: What happened? Why are you here? Powers: I-I... Uh, you see, I got roped into this somehow... Pearl: What?? Powers: And now I'm going to testify at tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: (So the decisive witness... is Mr. Powers?) Powers: I was talking with a detective until a little while ago, and I was on my way home... When all of a sudden, \"You there! You're under arrest!\" And I was brought back here. Phoenix: O-Oh. Powers: They said my face and whole self in general looked \"suspicious\" or something. Phoenix: (Hmm... Well, I guess I can see how they thought you looked suspicious...) Powers: *sigh* I'm just a normal guy on an exercise show for kids... Is that a crime?? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"...I... I'm sorry, everyone. I've lied to you all... I... I'm not a detective. I'm really... I'm really... I'm really Global Hero Onyankopon!\" Phoenix: ... I think he's lost his grip on what's real and what isn't... Talk Tomorrow's testimony Phoenix: So, about this \"testimony\" you're giving. What are you going to talk about? Powers: Ah, I really don't know yet... But it sounds like I saw something pretty important from what they tell me. Phoenix: You saw something important? What was it? Powers: Ah, well, the detective told me not to talk about it. \"You can't tell anyone, and especially not that lawyer,\" he said. Pearl: Who do you think is \"that lawyer\" the detective was talking about...? Phoenix: I'm going to take a wild guess and say it's me. Powers: ...Y-Yeah, you got it. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya and myself are your only two allies in this whole world, but it's alright! Phoenix: (Ouch... I don't really have a lot of friends, do I...?) Matt Engarde Powers: This is going to do a lot of damage to Matt, you know. Because he's got that \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image going. Phoenix: But what is he really like? Powers: Well, let's see. Matt's always been kind of a \"player\" with women... He would never really turn a pretty face away, if you know what I mean... He'd always say, \"It's just a game\" to justify himself. Pearl: What!? H-How horrible! That's unforgivable! Powers: Oww. S-Sorry. Didn't mean to offend you. But you know, he said once that, \"There's only one person in the world who won't swoon over me.\" Phoenix: One person who wouldn't swoon over him? Powers: His manager, you know. Ms. Adrian Andrews. Phoenix: (Why is Mr. Powers suddenly looking kind of... energetic?) Gossip Powers: Ah, you see, I'm actually a sucker for gossip. I mean, celebrities and their world have this dazzling sort of image, right? Phoenix: A dazzling sort of image? But aren't you a part of that dazzle, Mr. Powers? Powers: No, I'm more of a hairy, sweaty, smelly, brutish kind of guy, you see. But it's OK, really. I get to hear plenty of gossip about a lot of the other stars around me as things happen. Phoenix: Well, that's true. Powers: Oh, hey! So did you hear about this yet? About Ms. Andrews' mentor and her suicide...? Phoenix: You mean Ms. Inpax? Pearl: We heard something about how her wedding was cancelled... Powers: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! I thought about it a little the other day! About that mysterious death! Hey, Mr. Wright! Why don't you ask me about that!? Go on, go ahead! Phoenix: (Mr. Powers is so charged up his skin is practically glowing with electricity...) Celeste's suicide (appears after \"Gossip\") Powers: Hey, so have you heard this? Celeste left a suicide note! And they say that Juan went and hid it... Phoenix: We heard about that in court today. (But there wasn't any actual proof that she had left a note...) Powers: Well, this is what I think. I think that something bad was written on that note. Something bad for Juan, that is. Pearl: Something bad for Mr. Corrida? Phoenix: Why do you figure so? Powers: Well, before she died, Celeste talked with a few of her friends. And she said, \"It looks like I got caught up with a truly insidious man...\" (Changed from [And she said, 'It looks like I may have been caught by an insidious man...'] in the original release) Phoenix: A \"truly insidious man\"...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that? (Changed from [An 'insidious man'...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that?] in the original release) Powers: Well, there's no one else that fits the bill, right? And that would be reason enough for him to hide the suicide note! Phoenix: I see... Well, that's some good info. Thank you. Powers: Y-You're welcome! Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews; they're both at the detention center right now. There are still things I don't understand or know about, I'm sure... I have to get the two of them to tell me everything!) Present Radio Transceiver Powers: Um... That kidnapper... Has he said anything since then...? Phoenix: Well... He tried, but there was a lot of interference. Powers: I see... Phoenix: (That radio interference... Who would've thought it was caused by a spy camera?) Magazine Clipping Powers: Hey! That article! Is that from \"Gossip Land\"? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I guess so. Powers: Ah, you too? I absolutely love this magazine! Phoenix: Um... \"You too\"...? Powers: Oh, they wrote a little something about me once! \"Steel Samurai's Midnight Dine and Dash\". Pearl: Dine and dash...? Powers: I bought ten copies of that issue, you know. Phoenix: (Do you think we could somehow get back to THIS article...?) Guitar Case Powers: The Jammin' Ninja made me want a bright red guitar, you know. I wanted to be cool like him, so I went out and bought one. Phoenix: Oh... That's nice... Powers: Ah, but you don't understand. I can't get a single sound to come out of it. Because I sort of tripped on it and crushed it... the day after I bought it. Wine Glass, Crime Photo, Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo Powers: I can't believe Ms. Andrews tried to frame Matt... Those two have such a strange relationship with each other, don't they? Phoenix: (Looks like Mr. Powers is just as in the dark about things as I am. I guess I don't have a choice other than to go talk to the two of them myself.) Adrian Andrews profile Powers: Hey, that's Ms. Andrews! She's Matt's manager. Actually, I was interested in her for a little bit. Just a little... Phoenix: (Hmm... So Mr. Powers likes this type of woman...) What do you know about Ms. Andrews...? Powers: Well, see... Here's the thing. I don't really KNOW her know her... you know? Ah! If you're interested, I can give you a little bit of the details! Phoenix: (He's so happy, he looks like a lion that's just found his next meal...) Celeste Inpax profile Powers: That's Juan's former manager, right? Celeste Inpax... She was with Global Studios for a while way back when... But some things happened and she ended up moving over to Worldwide Studios. Pearl: \"Some things\"? As in? Powers: Well, there's no one left around who knows the details, you know. Only rumors are left now. Any other profile Powers: Umm... I'm honored you're asking me, I don't know anything special about this person... Umm... Sorry... Phoenix: Ah, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much. Powers: S-Sorry.

Phoenix: The bear... Gumshoe: I figured it out, pal! I figured that we should've been looking into the bear instead of the camera! Pearl: Um... Wasn't that Mr. Edgeworth that figured... Phoenix: Shh, Pearls. ...And? Go on. Gumshoe: There's only one person who bought one of those bears who's related to this crime! Pearl: Wh-Who is it!? Who would be so rude as to spy on another person in their room...? Gumshoe: ...Matt Engarde. Pearl: Huh? Gumshoe: Matt Engarde. Your client, that's who, pal! Phoenix: (And here I thought things couldn't get any worse...) Talk Stuffed bear Phoenix: Are you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was... Gumshoe: I heard it from the department store clerk, pal. This is the credit card receipt for the purchase. It's for $3,800, pal. That's an exact match to the price of that stuffed bear. Phoenix: A receipt...? That's all you have? Gumshoe: Nah, it's not just the receipt, pal. The store clerk said so himself. He told me, \"I'm sure I sold the bear to Mr. Engarde.\" I mean, the clerk even got Mr. Engarde's autograph out of it, pal. So I'm sure the person that bought the stuffed bear was Mr. Engarde himself! Phoenix: (My... My sight is failing me... Th-This can't be!) Credit Card Receipt added to the Court Record. Stuffed bear (subsequent times) Phoenix: Are you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was... Gumshoe: I heard it from the department store clerk, pal.

Gumshoe: Ah, that was a dead end, pal. I mean, you can get this kind of thing from anywhere. But for now, I guess I can give these back to you for you to file away into evidence. Spy Camera, Transmitter, and Stuffed Bear refiled into the Court Record. Spy camera (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what about the spy camera we found...? Gumshoe: Ah, that was a dead end, pal. I mean, you can get this kind of thing from anywhere. But for now, I guess I can give these back to you for you to file away into evidence. Present Radio Transceiver Gumshoe: Have you heard anything from the kidnapper...? Phoenix: Nope. Not a word since we were cut off by the radio interference. Gumshoe: Well, we know his goal is to get an acquittal for Matt Engarde... So, I don't think he'll hurt Maya, because that's not going to help him at all. Come on! We can't lose hope, pal! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Transmitter, Stuffed Bear, or Spy Camera Gumshoe: That Engarde... What was he thinking? Phoenix: You mean setting the spy camera up in the victim's room...? Gumshoe: Yeah! And it was recording at the time of the murder too, pal. Don't you find that just a tad suspicious? It doesn't sound like a coincidence to me... Pearl: ... Gumshoe: Ah! I mean, don't mind me! I didn't mean it that way, pal... Phoenix: (Then what \"way\" did you mean it?) Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: My impression of her has totally changed, pal. Phoenix: Hmm... I wonder what she is doing right now...? Gumshoe: I'm sure she's still being questioned. She sure got herself into quite a big mess trying to frame Mr. Engarde. She'll probably be spending the night at the detention center... Phoenix: (Yeah, that's right. She's still at the detention center.) After clearing all Talk options: Gumshoe: I know you don't want to give up, pal... Phoenix: (I never thought... I didn't think it was possible... The person who put the spy camera in Juan Corrida's room was Matt Engarde!) Pearl: Why... Why would Mr. Engarde do something like this!? Gumshoe: I bet it was to catch Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida in one of their rendezvous. Phoenix: \"I bet\" is not good enough for me. I have to know the absolute truth behind this camera. Gumshoe: Are you going to see him? Mr. Engarde, I mean. Phoenix: Yes. Pearl: I'm... I'm scared, Mr. Nick. I wonder... I wonder what we will find out next... Phoenix: (I'm scared myself, but I have to put on a good face for Pearls... Matt Engarde! What in the world have you done!?) Corrida's Hotel Room Present Spy Camera or Transmitter Pearl: I've learned a lot of things during this case. For example, if you want to spy on someone, there are devices like this you can use. Phoenix: Well, it's not really a device for the purpose of spying. The way any device is used is decided by the people who use them. Pearl: ... Stuffed Bear Pearl: Poor teddy... I feel bad for it. Its eye was... It was... And all for the criminal's mean plan... Phoenix: (This bear... It's an expensive luxury brand from overseas.) But it's OK, Pearls. Now it's helping us by giving us a clue... It's telling us who the real culprit is so we can get some justice. Detention Center (after clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices) Engarde: You're working really late, you know. It's already past 10:00 PM, dude. Phoenix: I think it's time you told me the truth. Engarde: ... Relax. Don't you know that \"ignorance is bliss\"? But if you really want to know, let's talk. Talk Matt's secret (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Engarde: Well done, Mr. Wright. I bet it wasn't easy to gather as much information as you have. Phoenix: You really... So you were Shelly de Killer's client!? Engarde: You don't really think I would dirty my own hands in this, do you? Pearl: Wh-What do you mean!? Engarde: And that woman... Adrian was quite brave herself. Trying to stick the crime on me -- I didn't think she had it in her. But all I care about is that Juan is dead. Isn't that right, Mister Lawyer? Pearl: Th-That's... You're lying!! What a terrible...! Engarde: It's way past your bedtime... little girl. Go on, and let us grown-ups talk about more... adult things. Pearl: But why!? Why did you hide the video camera and... Engarde: ... A weakling soon believes the words of others... just like that pathetic Adrian. Phoenix: (He knew about Ms. Andrews' secret...?) Engarde: But I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all assassins. Phoenix: What...? Engarde: Oh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail. They turn their clients into cashcows by holding the sinful deed over their heads. And a superstar like me, how much do you think I'm worth? Care to guess? Pearl: And... And that's why...? Engarde: Yes, that's where the video comes in. It's got his face and the crime scene recorded on it, preserved for all time. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want. That's right. That video is my \"insurance\"... Isn't that what they call it, Mr. Wright? Pearl: Why would you do something so wrong...? Engarde: Because I'm a grown-up, and I can. Good enough of an answer for you, little girl? Motive for murder (appears after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: Why!? Why would you kill Mr. Corrida...? Engarde: Because he was about to sling so much dung onto my beautiful public image. Scandals are a little annoying, aren't they? Phoenix: This is all because of that press conference, isn't it...? Pearl: If Mr. Corrida had been able to give it, then Mr. Engarde's secret would've... Engarde: Ah, well, that's what we call \"taking advantage of the situation\", you know? I had no interest in doing it, really, but bit by bit, it crept up on me. And then the situation just presented itself perfectly... \"How beautiful,\" I thought. Pearl: And that's... That's how Mr. Corrida ended up dead... Engarde: Let me tell you something. I'm not like Adrian. I don't depend on anyone. People are simply things to be used. Used and thrown away. Put on a sweet, innocent face, and people will swallow anything you feed them. Adrian fell for it. The assassin too. Oh, and how can I forget. Even you fell for it, Mister Lawyer! Everyone, all working their butts off for me, Matt Engarde! Pearl: ... Engarde: Aww, did that leave you speechless? What a shame. Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Matt's Secret -- Phoenix: Now, let's hear what this \"secret\" of yours is. What if Mr. Corrida had been successful in his plan? What would he have disclosed...? Engarde: I told you before, dude. I don't know! I don't know anything about Juan, OK? Look, Mr. Wright. I can keep on saying it until I'm blue in the face, but... I totally didn't pay Juan any attention the whole time that night! I mean, come on! I was in the middle of a nap! Phoenix: Don't lie to me. Engarde: Huh? Phoenix: I know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night! Present Spy Camera or Transmitter Phoenix: Phoenix: Someone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder. Engarde: ...\"Secretly film\"...? What? Phoenix: And then sent the images the camera took with this transmitter. Engarde: Wow... But dude, where was this camera you're talking about hidden? Present Stuffed Bear Phoenix: Leads to: \"The spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: Mr. Lawyer dude, I'm really tired... Phoenix: I know... Engarde: But dude, you look even more tired than me. Why don't we call it quits for today and get some sleep? How does that sound? Phoenix: What made you say that all of a sudden? Engarde: Well, you're here showing me stuff that doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: Oh, oops. (I guess I really must be tired...) But I'm not giving up just yet. Leads back to: \"Someone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder.\" Phoenix: The spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye! Engarde: ... Phoenix: A bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan! 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"...Hmph.\" Present Stuffed Bear Phoenix: This bear was in Mr. Corrida's room on the night of the murder. A bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan! Engarde: So? It's a present, dude. It actually looks kinda classy, if you know what I mean. Phoenix: Yes, I hear it's quite expensive. Which is why it is very odd that this gadget was found inside this bear! Present Spy Camera or Transmitter Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is a very small video camera.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: Mr. Lawyer dude, I'm really tired... Phoenix: I know... Engarde: But dude, you look even more tired than me. Why don't we call it quits for today and get some sleep? How does that sound? Phoenix: What made you say that all of a sudden? Engarde: Well, you're here showing me stuff that doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: Oh, oops. (I guess I really must be tired...) But I'm not giving up just yet. Leads back to: \"This bear was in Mr. Corrida's room on the night of the murder.\" Phoenix: This is a very small video camera. And it was hidden inside this bear's eye. Engarde: ...Maybe it's a really curious bear...? Phoenix: Well, whatever this \"bear\" saw was sent somewhere using this transmitter. Which means... Someone, on the night of the murder, was secretly filming Mr. Corrida's room! 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"...Hmph.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult my friend, OK? ... ... He said I should snort while I give a good laugh. Phoenix: Um... Engarde: OK, here I go. ... Aha ha ha ha *snort!* Phoenix: (I can't believe he can be so flippant at a time like this...) Um, Mr. Engarde... I don't think you need to snort while you laugh. Really. Leads back to: \"I know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night!\" Engarde: ...Hmph. I guess Juan had a few of those kinds of fans too, huh dude? Phoenix: Actually, I wouldn't say this bear was a present from a \"fan\". Engarde: ... Hmm... You sure, dude? Who else could it be from? Phoenix: The person who gave this bear to Mr. Corrida was... Present Matt Engarde profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Engarde. Don't you know this bear from somewhere...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my mom, OK? ... ... She says that I can't be friends with someone like you. Phoenix: Um... Engarde: Go home! If you don't go away, I'm gonna call the police on you! Phoenix: (...That's strange. I thought the answer was right there in front of me...) Leads back to: \"Actually, I wouldn't say this bear was a present from a \"fan\".\" Phoenix: Mr. Engarde. Don't you know this bear from somewhere...? Engarde: I don't think I've ever met Mr. Bear before, dude. Phoenix: Aww, but he says he knows you. How could you forget such a great friend? Engarde: ... What else did the bear tell you? Phoenix: He says that the one who put the camera in his eye was you, Mr. Engarde. Engarde: ... If I didn't know how you work in court, I'd think I was in some serious trouble. Come on... This is all a joke, right dude? You're just pulling my leg. Phoenix: Looks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet. Engarde: Well, do you have any proof you want to show me first? Phoenix: Here is proof that it was you who put the camera inside the bear: Present Credit Card Receipt Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, come on, Mr. Engarde! Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my grandma, OK? ... ... Did you know? It's bad to whistle at night, dude... Because snakes will come out if you do. Phoenix: Um... Engarde: My grandma, she knows all sorts of stuff. I think you'd better learn from her example, OK? Phoenix: (Is he telling me to think carefully before I speak...? Argh! So close and yet so far!) Leads back to: \"Looks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet.\" Phoenix: I have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde. It's from when YOU bought that stuffed bear! Engarde: Dude, all you can tell from this is that I spent $3,800. I go to that department store all the time, OK? This $3,800... This could be the toothbrush I bought that one time. Phoenix: A-A THIRTY-EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR TOOTHBRUSH!? Engarde: ...It's ivory... And it's got elephant hair for bristles... Phoenix: (Eww... Elephant hair? Is that what rich people use nowadays...?) Anyway! The store clerk clearly remembers you and your purchase. After all, you even gave him an autograph, did you not!? Engarde: ... Dude... You should've said that earlier. 1 LOCK BROKEN Engarde: ... Um, so can I ask you one thing? Phoenix: Yes? Engarde: You're my lawyer, right dude? So, if you are, then why are you looking into stuff like that? Phoenix: Because if I don't know the truth, I can't help you. Engarde: Sounds more like stupid lawyer talk to me... Hey, let's stop talking about this, OK? Phoenix: No, not yet. I haven't asked why you set the camera up yet. Engarde: ... Phoenix: And what your \"secret\" is. Of course, it would be strictly confidential... Engarde: So...? What are you going to do now? Phoenix: I'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must. The reason you hid this camera in Mr. Corrida's room and filmed it in secret is... Present Picture Card Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wh-What is this card...?\" Present Magazine Clipping or Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Engarde: Adrian Andrews? Phoenix: There is a rumor going around... That Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida were having secret meetings. Engarde: ... Phoenix: You, who was keeping tabs on Mr. Corrida... You were going to reveal this as fact, and turn it into a scandal. Isn't that right!? Engarde: ... ...Dude, you can be such a moron. Phoenix: Huh? Engarde: Oh man, Mr. Lawyer dude, that kind of scandal... That's the good stuff! That's what we in the industry call \"juicy\"! Phoenix: ...The \"good stuff\"...? \"Juicy\"...? Engarde: Look, we can get publicity without spending a penny with that kind of stuff. I mean, if people stopped paying attention to us, then it'd be the end, dude. Phoenix: ... Too bad that wasn't your intention. Engarde: What are you talking about? Phoenix: I wish your reason for spying was something so innocent. But it wasn't. You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews... Then there's only one reason I can think of for you to do such a thing. Engarde: ...! Phoenix: The real reason you set up that camera in Mr. Corrida's room was... Present Picture Card Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wh-What is this card...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: ...If I really wanted to set up a spy camera... I wouldn't have set it up in Juan's room. It would be in your office, dude. Phoenix: Huh? My office...? Engarde: Well, dude, you're always saying really absurd things, right? It'd be like getting the comedy channel for free! Phoenix: (Argh! I'm so close! I can feel it!) I-If you're done laughing! Leads back to: \"You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Engarde: ... ... Phoenix: Mr. Engarde? Engarde: Dude, how about you take that bear home with you and talk to it? I'm sure Mr. Bear will talk with you about as much as I will, which is not at all. Phoenix: Um... (I have to somehow get it through his head I'm not giving up.) Engarde: So, is it time to throw in the towel yet, dude? Phoenix: Sorry, but no. Leads back to: \"I'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must.\" Engarde: Wh-What is this card...? Phoenix: (Maybe he doesn't know about this card...) This is a certain man's \"calling card\"... The man's name is Shelly de Killer... and I'm sure you know of him, don't you? Engarde: Shelly... de Killer... Th-Th-That's ridiculous! Wh-Why would I know some shady scumbag like him...? Phoenix: If you really don't know him, then why are you acting so jumpy all of a sudden? Engarde: Umm! Phoenix: (This is it! I'm finally starting to get to the truth! I can't afford to make any more mistakes now...) Mr. Matt Engarde. I know why you know Mr. de Killer. It's because... you're a hero of justice. Phoenix: It's because you're the great hero of justice, the Nickel Samurai! Engarde: Duuuuude!? Phoenix: You spied on that room to do one thing and one thing only! To expose Shelly de Killer's fiendish plot! Engarde: ...I... ...Okay... If that's what you think, then whatever, dude. Phoenix: ... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry. Slip of the tongue... Leads back to: \"Mr. Matt Engarde.\" you're his client. Leads to: \"Since you're the one who set up that camera...\" you're a star. Phoenix: It's because you're a star! Engarde: Duuuuude!? What in the world are you talking about!? Phoenix: Well, you're a star. And stars never need a logical, or sane reason for anything! Engarde: ...I... ...Okay... If that's what you think, then whatever, dude. Phoenix: ... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry. Slip of the tongue... Leads back to: \"Mr. Matt Engarde.\" Phoenix: Since you're the one who set up that camera... That means you knew... You knew exactly what was going to happen in that room! Engarde: ... Phoenix: So... How? How would you know something like that...? It's because you're his client. That's why. You hired Shelly de Killer to assassinate Mr. Juan Corrida! The real mastermind behind this whole murder is... You, Matt Engarde! Engarde: ... ... ... ...*sigh* And here I was, trying to be a good boy for you, dude. Phoenix: ...! Engarde: I thought if you didn't know, you'd be able to do your job without feeling bad. Well, that's what I thought, anyway... Phoenix: M-Mr. Engarde... You really did hire...!? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult myself, OK? ... ... Phoenix: (Consult... \"myself\"...??) Engarde: ...Well, I guess it's probably about time anyway. Phoenix: About time for what? Engarde: I think it's time for you to meet him now, Mr. Lawyer dude. 3 LOCKS BROKEN Engarde: How do you do... Mister Lawyer? I'm Matt Engarde. Unlock Successful Anything (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Engarde: I don't care what you show... I think you've gotten enough out of me, don't you? Enough freebies for today. The rest is up to you, isn't that right... Mister Lawyer? After breaking Matt Enguarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Engarde: What's wrong, Mister Lawyer? You've grown awfully quiet... Phoenix: H-How could I have been so deceived by you all this time? When we first met, I asked if you had killed Juan Corrida... And you answered very clearly that you hadn't killed anyone. Engarde: Hey now. I never told you any lies. The person who did the killing was that De Killer guy, right? All I'm guilty of is taking a catnap in my room. Phoenix: You... You... You killed Mr. Corrida! Engarde: Hahaha. I dare you to say that in court tomorrow. Phoenix: Grr... Engarde: Aww, but too bad. You can't. You're my lawyer, after all. Aren't you? Phoenix: ... Engarde: You could always drop my case and refuse to represent me. How does that sound? Aww, but you can't, can you? That would be the one thing you absolutely can't do. Pearl: M-Mystic Maya...! Engarde: You wouldn't want to test De Killer. He's a man of his word, or so I hear. You could end up getting a certain friend of yours rubbed out if you lose. Phoenix: ...Y...You... scoundrel... Engarde: So if I were you, Mr. Wright, esquire, I think I would give it my all tomorrow. Remember, everyone likes a happy win-win resolution. Phoenix: I... I'll get you for this! Engarde: That's such a clich\u00e9 phrase. Juan said something just like that, if memory serves. Of course... Well, we all know how well things turned out for him, don't we? Good night, Mister Lawyer. Phoenix: (Maya... Maya, what am I supposed to do!?) ???: ... And now... Now you've finally found it. Edgeworth: The starting line of this case. Phoenix: Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I don't care for the horrid atmosphere here. Let's return to the precinct. March 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Edgeworth: Well, Wright? What are you going to do? If you plan on changing your defense... Pearl: N...No! We can't do that... Edgeworth: That's right... He's holding Maya hostage... Phoenix: ... What... What should I do...? Edgeworth: ... That's not something I can answer for you. Pearl: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Wright... Only you can decide where to go from here. One year ago... At that time, I didn't truly understand what a \"prosecutor\" was. And that is why... I had to leave the Prosecutor's Office. I felt that I couldn't stand in a court of law until I knew what a prosecutor really was. And now, Wright... It's your turn. Phoenix: My... turn? Edgeworth: What is this thing called a \"lawyer\"? What can you do as one? You must find the answer... And you must find it on your own. Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: I'm a lawyer... But to fight for someone who is clearly a killer... Matt Engarde... That man is really... Argh! Edgeworth: It doesn't matter who, every person deserves a proper defense and a fair trial. Isn't that the basis of our judicial system? Phoenix: \"Proper defense\"? But what exactly is that? Is it where a lawyer forcibly and blindly gets an acquittal through shouting and trickery? Edgeworth: ...*sigh* Ironic that you of all people should say such a thing. Isn't that exactly how you have fought for your clients up until now? Phoenix: Uh... W-Well, that may be true, but... But that's... That's because I've believed my clients to be innocent from the bottom of my heart! But if I were to get Engarde an acquittal... That... That isn't a proper defense at all! Maya's situation Phoenix: I became a lawyer because I thought... I thought I could save people who were suffering and in pain... Pearl: ... Phoenix: But... When I look at this mess we're in... I can't even protect the person closest to me. Even if I win the case, I still lose in the end... I just don't know what to do! Edgeworth: ... Wright. Would you get a hold of yourself? You have it all wrong. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: We aren't some sort of heroes. We're only human, you and I. You want to \"save someone\"? That's something easier said than done, wouldn't you say? Pearl: Th-That's... Edgeworth: You are a defense lawyer. You can't run away from that. You can only fight. That's all you can do. Why fight? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Maya's situation\") Leads to: \"People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down.\" Present Anything Phoenix: (Now's not the time to talk about evidence...) Phoenix: People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down. You fight to the very end, even when you know the truth is not with you. But I'm not like you. I can't fight for a false verdict -- for a man I clearly know to be guilty! Edgeworth: ... Franziska... She fights for herself. The only thing she fights for is her perfect win record. That's all. Phoenix: And!? Isn't that the same as you!? Isn't that why you ran away a year ago? Because your precious win record was destroyed!? You are so petty! Edgeworth: ... I see... Now I understand why you despise me so. However, you are mistaken. Phoenix: What do you...? Edgeworth: Thanks to you, when you sealed off my path to a perfect win record... I began to realize the error of my ways. I realized that things such as a perfect record were meaningless. Pearl: What!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release) Phoenix: I don't believe you. Are you saying that is why you left the Prosecutor's Office? But then, why? Why are you here now? Edgeworth: The answer to that... is something you will find out on your own. I have faith you will see it before the verdict is read tomorrow. But if you can't, then you will be powerless to change the ending of this story. ...*beep beep beep*... Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! The transceiver! ...*beep*... ???: I'm sorry for what happened earlier. Well then, Mr. Attorney. Do you wager you can obtain an acquittal tomorrow? Phoenix: ... ???: My, my. What is the matter, Mr. Attorney? I don't sense your usual anger this time. Phoenix: ...Tell me. Please. Why are you holding Maya hostage for Mr. Engarde's sake? Why are you... Why are you doing this for that cold-blooded killer!? Edgeworth: Wright... ???: ... Please don't misunderstand things. He is my client. Phoenix: Don't toy with me! A man who hires an assassin is just as much of a killer himself! ???: ... ...I believe you were asking me for a reason as to why I am doing what I am... Phoenix: ...Y-Yeah. ???: This is what I like to call my \"aftercare\". Phoenix: Wh-What the heck is \"aftercare\"? ???: My name carries a certain amount of honor and dignity, Mr. Attorney. I take great care to insure that no suspicion falls upon my clients for my handiwork. That is what is called \"client relations\" and it is a part of an assassin's duty. Phoenix: An assassin's... \"duty\"...? ???: We were unlucky this time and my client was arrested as a suspect. As a result, I did what I had to do to enlist your expert help, Mr. Attorney. And to ensure that you would do everything in your power to the very end. Phoenix: Wh-What is your name!? ???: I believe I told you once before, however... Phoenix: You did... But... ???: My name is... De Killer. Shelly de Killer. Edgeworth: Y-You're Shelly de Killer!? de Killer: Please keep in mind you do not have much space to maneuver with me. As a De Killer, I always finish what I set out to do. If you fail to keep up your end of the bargain... Phoenix: M-Maya! de Killer: It would be my duty as an assassin to see to it she receives a nice long nap. Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaaah! Noooooooooooo! de Killer: Now then, if you'll excuse me. If someone were to trace this signal back to me, it would be quite troublesome. ...Meow. ...*beep*... Pearl: Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaa! Edgeworth: I... I don't know what to say... Phoenix: ...Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hm? Phoenix: Did you hear that? At the end of that transmission... ...Meow. Edgeworth: Huh? Oh, that... It sounded like a cat. Pearl: ...A cat? Phoenix: (It can't be... that cat... Can it...?) Pearl: What is it...? Phoenix: I think... I know where Shelly de Killer is holding Maya hostage! Edgeworth! Have all police units head for Engarde Mansion immediately! Edgeworth: ...! Alright. You hurry over as well, then! Phoenix: Don't lose hope yet, Pearls! The fight has only just begun! Pearl: Y-Yeah! Detention Center (after breaking Matt Engarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: (Now then, whose story do I want to hear?) Matt Engarde Jailer: I'm really sorry, but... Matt Engarde is refusing to meet with you. Phoenix: ...I see. Phoenix: (Well, I guess I don't really have anything left to talk to him about anyway...) Pearl: Shall we listen to what Ms. Andrews has to say...? March 22Engarde MansionLiving Room Phoenix: Maya! Pearl: Please answer us! Mystic Mayaaaa! Edgeworth: We have this area completely surrounded. There is no way for him to escape. Assuming he's still in the area... Phoenix: I can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer... Edgeworth: He and Engarde were working together all this time. I'm sure they had worked out a contingency plan ahead of time. Examine Fireplace Phoenix: This is the first time I've seen such a large fireplace. Edgeworth: I don't particularly care for large fireplaces. They remind me of my youth. Phoenix: (I wonder, if memory serves, if it's because of that rich aunt he had?) Don't tell me you're still stuck on that incident...? Edgeworth: Don't take this personally, but I really do not wish to remember anything from that time in my life. Motorcycle Edgeworth: It seems that Engarde was quite famous, even as a motorcycle racer. Phoenix: Generally when a star like him tries to do something like that, they fail, but... Edgeworth: It seems Engarde is no ordinary man. Lounge set Edgeworth: That Engarde... This is probably where he conducted business with De Killer. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: Shelly de Killer values his client relations more than anything else. So I'm sure he must meet with his clients in person to talk about any transactions. Masks Edgeworth: It's Engarde's personal collection. I'd say it's a hobby of his to collect prop masks of shows related to his own. Phoenix: You seem to know all sorts of details about Matt Engarde... Almost too many details... Edgeworth: He's the defendant in this case. Of course I would know about him. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... I guess that makes sense... Doorway behind railing Phoenix: It looks like there's another room in the back. Edgeworth: Leave that to us. I'm sure the investigation team is already doing its job in there. Door Pearl: There's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: I bet it's for the cat to use. Pearl: Oh, you mean Shoe. Bear figurine Leads to: \"Oh, it's a figurine of a bear!\" Pearl: Oh, it's a figurine of a bear! But there are a lot of cuts in it for some reason... Figurine added to the Court Record. Phoenix: A bear...? Isn't that more of a thing for Mr. Corrida? Why would something like this be here...? Edgeworth: Wright, look down. There's a little pet door installed here. Pearl: Ah, I'm sure that's for Shoe... Phoenix: Do you think that this... came through that little door...? Edgeworth: Umph! This door... It's locked! Phoenix: Well, I'm pretty used to breaking doors down by now. Let's go, Edgeworth! *SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!* Private Lounge Phoenix: Argh! There's no one here! Edgeworth: From the looks of this room, I would say this is Engarde's private lounge. ...Look at this, Wright! Phoenix: An antennae for sending and receiving radio signals and a VCR... Check inside the deck! If there's a tape, it would be an important piece of evidence! (If we're lucky, it'll have the moment the crime was committed recorded on it!) Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but... The tape deck is empty. There's no tape to be found. Pearl: No... Edgeworth: But there's no mistake that someone used this to record something. It looks like someone took the tape we're looking for, and escaped with it... Examine TV Phoenix: A huge television and speakers loom largely here. I'm sure if Maya saw this, she'd say, Maya: \"I would die a happy Samurai fan if I could see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this!\" Phoenix: Yeah, that's what she'd say... ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about Maya, all things considered... Satellite dish Phoenix: It's a VCR and an antennae. The footage that the spy camera took at the scene of the crime... was beamed here and recorded on tape. Pearl: If only we had that tape, it would have been really helpful... Computer Phoenix: It's Engarde's computer. Maya... Why couldn't you have used this to get help? Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! Where's... Where's the power switch!? Phoenix: ... (Oh, I get it... So that's what happened. She couldn't find the power switch...) Table Phoenix: It's a very small table. I bet we could barely squeeze 3 Pearls on there. Pearl: But I wouldn't sit on a table to begin with, Mr. Nick... Sofa Phoenix: What a spacious sofa. I bet 10 Pearls would fit on here. Pearl: Um, I don't think 10 of me would fit, Mr. Nick... Video tapes Phoenix: I can't read all the labels, but this is a very large collection of video tapes. Looks like Engarde taped all of his own shows... Door Pearl: There's a little door for Shoe in this big door. Phoenix: I'm sure Maya used this door to shove this out there... I'm sure it was her! (Every time you give me some piece of evidence, it's always the most crucial piece. This time too, I'm sure...) Wine Cellar Phoenix: ... (We've searched all over, but it looks like he got away...) Edgeworth: I'm sorry. It looks like he slipped out of our grasp this time. Phoenix: And now... we've lost our only lead. Edgeworth: Don't give up yet. That little girl is looking to you to be her pillar. Pearl: ... Phoenix: ...Yeah, you're right. Edgeworth: We're close, I can tell. We've already set up checkpoints along every route leading out of this district. Leave the rest to us. Phoenix: (Maya...) Examine Bottles Pearl: Wow... I've never seen so many bottles all in one place before. Phoenix: Well, I guess when you're a star, you have so much money you can buy anything you want. Boxes Phoenix: The light doesn't filter in all the way, so it's hard to see. It looks like there are crates and cardboard boxes tied up with wire here. Door Pearl: It's a pretty heavy door, isn't it? I can't open it by myself. Please don't shut me in here by accident, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (If I were locked in a place like this... I'd be plenty scared too. Trust me.) Photo frame Leads to: \"This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax...\" Phoenix: This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax... (\"With love... Celeste\") Pearl: Ms. Inpax? You mean...? Phoenix: Yes, Mr. Corrida's former manager. Pearl: Why would a picture of Ms. Inpax be here in Mr. Engarde's mansion? Phoenix: (And why does it say, \"With love\"...? Hmm, this might be a clue...) Celeste's Photo added to the Court Record. Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: What's wrong, Pearls? Pearl: P-Please let me see that picture frame! Phoenix: (Huh? What's so special about the frame?) Pearl: On the back... There's something written on the back of the frame! ...\"Maya\" It's Mystic Maya! She left us a message! Phoenix: Wh-What!? Maya: I thought you'd come. I knew you would. Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever! I'm fine, so you don't need to worry. ...There's so much I want to write, but I don't think I have a lot of time left. Pearly, you're there too, right? Make sure you help Nick, OK? Someone's gotta watch out for the helpless lunk. ... Um... That's it for now, Nick. I guess I'll talk to you guys later. Pearl: ...That's... I... Nooooooooo! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa... *sob* Edgeworth: Wright! Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: What's wrong? Why the blank stare? Phoenix: Oh, um, nothing. Edgeworth: We've searched the house, and this is the last room. It looks like he eluded us. Phoenix: ...Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Yes? Phoenix: As far as clues go, I think this is about all I'm going to get. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: But I'm still short one last thing... Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews' Psyche-Lock... If I could just find out what secret she's holding... Then I think I stand a chance in court tomorrow... To blow this case wide open and expose the truth.) Edgeworth: I think I know what you're thinking. I'll contact the detention center. Phoenix: Um... Thanks, Edgeworth. Well, let's go Pearls. It's time to open that last lock. March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room Andrews: Good evening, Mr. Wright. ... What's wrong? You look ill... Phoenix: Ms. Andrews. I have come to remove your Psyche-Lock. Andrews: Psyche-Lock...? Phoenix: I want to know, and you will tell me... ...your secret. Andrews: Fine, go ahead. Try to break me, if you can. Talk Why frame him? (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Andrews: Celeste... She was supposed to get married to Juan. Phoenix: Yes... But I heard that it didn't work out. Pearl: Because Mr. Corrida didn't want to get married to her anymore, right...? Andrews: Yes... Because of Matt. Pearl: B-Because of Mr. Engarde? What do you mean? Phoenix: (I think I can see where this is going.) Andrews: Celeste... She was Matt's manager a long time ago. She was the happiest woman in the world at that time. I was working part-time back then, and I often saw the two of them together. Phoenix: So that's why... \"With love... Celeste\" is written on the frame of that picture. Pearl: They were a couple, weren't they? Andrews: It wasn't anything as splendid as that. Celeste was being used; toyed with until she was... thrown away. Pearl: That's so horrible... Andrews: Matt's entire image is built around how nice and wonderful of a man he is. A scandal would have destroyed that. Which is why Celeste, in her kindness, moved over to Worldwide Studios. And that is where she met Juan. She seemed really happy with him; even happier than when she was with Matt. Celeste and Juan were such a good match that they were even planning to get married. And then it was suddenly called off. On the night Juan called their marriage off, Celeste... She killed herself. And that's why I framed Matt. It was revenge for Celeste and for myself. Revenge (appears after \"Why frame him?\") Leads to: \"I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right?\" Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- Why Frame Him? -- Phoenix: Can you please tell me why you framed Mr. Engarde for the murder? Andrews: I've already told you countless times. It's because I thought Matt was the killer. Phoenix: (No, that's not it! I know you have a personal reason to dislike Mr. Engarde.) Ms. Andrews. You may think I didn't hear it, but I know you said something earlier. You said, \"Revenge.\" Andrews: So you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why? Wh-What an absurd idea. I... I don't have anything I want to take revenge for. Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews... A woman who lives by being dependent on other people...) (Changed from [Ms. Andrews... A woman who lives by being dependant [sic] on another person...] in the original release) (There is something or someone in her past that would make her take revenge...) Present Suicide Report or Celeste Inpax profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"C-Celeste...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: Are you trying to help or hurt Matt with what you're doing...? Phoenix: What? What am I doing? Andrews: This random, haphazard throwing out of evidence you're so fond of doing. Phoenix: Th-That's not what I was trying to do at all! Andrews: Then refrain from doing it anymore. Phoenix: (I guess I screwed up big again...) Leads back to: \"So you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why?\" Andrews: C-Celeste... Phoenix: There is only one catalyst that could cause such strong feelings, and even revenge. And that is Ms. Inpax's suicide. Andrews: Wh-What are you trying to say? Celeste was Juan's manager. Phoenix: ... Andrews: On top of that, the one who hid her suicide note was also Juan. What does all this have to do with Matt? Phoenix: You're right. You haven't mentioned him... Yet. But for you to hate Mr. Engarde... It would mean that he must have had some relation to Ms. Inpax and her suicide. Andrews: Can you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!? Present Celeste's Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: That's it? Phoenix: Yes... Andrews: And what sort of relation is this supposed to explain? Phoenix: W-Well, Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde's... Andrews: Before you start, Mr. Wright, perhaps I should first request to see proof that your brain is wired correctly. Phoenix: (Argh. I can't afford to mess up something as big as this! I need evidence that clearly shows a connection between Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde. If I can find that, I can finally get the real story!) Andrews: I wonder if you'd like to try again, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"Can you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!?\" Phoenix: This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct? She looks younger than when she passed away though. Andrews: ...W... Phoenix: \"With love... Celeste\". This is Ms. Inpax's handwriting, isn't it? Andrews: ... Where did you find this...? No, that's alright. It was a rhetorical question... Phoenix: Yeah, it is. I found this at Mr. Engarde's mansion. Andrews: ... ...And after all this time... My last remaining secret has been revealed... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Andrews: I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right? Matt \"confessed\" to Juan... about his relationship with Celeste. Phoenix: I see... So that's what happened. Pearl: But... Then why did Mr. Corrida have to call off the wedding!? I don't understand at all... Andrews: It was probably because of his worthless male pride. Juan and Matt were always fierce rivals. Matt waited for the wedding announcement and then unleashed the truth on Juan. He was aiming for when it would hurt Juan the most. Pearl: Poor Ms. Inpax! Andrews: ...That wasn't the end of it. That day, I'm almost certain that Celeste left a suicide note behind. And in that note, she left a detailed account of Matt's various misdeeds, and... So that she would never again be hurt by Matt, she chose... to die. Then, when Juan discovered her body, he hid her note. Pearl: B-But why would he do that!? Andrews: It's simple. Juan realized that note was a powerful weapon against Matt. And it would be especially damaging to his \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image. In any case... With his pride hurt, Juan sought revenge. Phoenix: Revenge... There's that word again. Andrews: Juan wanted to publicly disclose the contents of that suicide note. At a time that would cause Matt the most damage, of course. Phoenix: And that was at the press conference after the stage show... Andrews: I know all about it, because I heard it all from Juan. It was so I could find out about all this that I drew close to Juan to begin with. They're quite a pair of hideous monsters, aren't they? Even Celeste's death was something for them to use in their game. That night, when I found Juan's body, it was only natural that I thought the murderer was Matt. Those two were always spying on one another, after all. As for me, I was frantically searching for Celeste's suicide note. I wanted to destroy it before it ever went public. I was going to burn it. I had even brought a lighter. But... I couldn't find the suicide note... And that's when revenge crossed my mind. Yes, I was going to bring to them my own kind of cruel revenge. Celeste was killed by those two monsters. So when I stabbed Juan's body with that knife... I didn't feel a single shred of guilt. Pearl: ...! Andrews: ... And that's all I have to say. Phoenix: ... Andrews: Well, Mr. Wright? Even knowing all this, are you still going to help that... \"man\"? Phoenix: ... I... I'm a lawyer... Andrews: I see. What a foul profession. Phoenix: ... Thank you very much for your time and for talking with me. Andrews: It was no big deal. I couldn't sleep anyway. Phoenix: (I can't sleep either... Not with Maya's situation... or with what I know now...) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Maya Fey) Maya: I can't see very well in this darkness, but it doesn't seem like there's anything there...

I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- Request Taking --de Killer: This request came to me... oh, about a week ago.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: One week ago? Are you sure? de Killer: Yes, I am quite sure. I, of course, had my own preparations... And I was barely able to finish. When you request my services, Mr. Attorney, I hope you will keep that in mind. Phoenix: Please... stop... de Killer: In any case, my client this time had a very specific date and time in mind. Phoenix: (A specific date and time...?)de Killer: It was a request for my services on the night of the awards ceremony.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you ask why on that specific night? de Killer: No. I try to fulfill all the conditions of my clients' request. But as for why, I only had my suspicions. Phoenix: (Your suspicions, huh?) Press further Phoenix: So what are these \"suspicions\" you had? Why did your client request that night...? de Killer: I'm sure it was all for the bear. Phoenix: The bear...? de Killer: My client spoke of it. \"I'm sure there will be a bear-shaped figurine in Juan Corrida's room. I would like you to retrieve that item for me.\" Phoenix: (He must be talking about this bear puzzle...) Edgeworth: Inside that figurine was a suicide note. Naturally, the victim brought it with him to his hotel room. He was planning to publicly disclose its contents at the press conference, after all. de Killer: That is correct. And if I had not done the job that night, I would not have known where that bear figurine was... Phoenix: (I see...) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Was the testimony just now of any importance? It was very important. Phoenix: The testimony just now has made one thing clear. And that is... The \"client\" knew the secret of the bear figurine! Edgeworth: ... Judge: ... Phoenix: Huh...? Why is everyone so quiet...? Judge: Mr. Wright. I think all of us already knew that. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Edgeworth: Witness, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination It was not important. Phoenix: (What De Killer said sounds plausible, but... In the end, it's just his conjecture...) No, Your Honor. I don't think it's very important. Judge: Hmm... Well then, witness, please continue. Leads back to cross-examination Let it go Phoenix: (Even if I ask about them, it would only be a guess.) I see... That's fine then. Leads back to cross-examinationde Killer: We met at a certain bar to discuss and finalize a few matters.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you physically met Adrian Andrews, right? de Killer: ... Of course I did. Phoenix: (What was that?? What was with the brief pause...?) Press further (before adding statement) Phoenix: Witness! I would like for you to give us a few more details. de Killer: I always meet my clients as a matter of principle. I have never taken a request by telephone or mail. Edgeworth: And why is that? de Killer: That's because I value the trust between a client and myself above all else. And the only way to establish that is to speak to the client while looking them in the eye. Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Was the testimony just now of any importance? It was very important. Phoenix: Of course, it was very important, Your Honor. If Mr. de Killer had met his client before the murder, then it's unlikely he is mistaken! Judge: Hmm... So you're saying that his client really was Adrian Andrews? Phoenix: Ah... um... I guess so... de Killer: You see. It is just as I said. Edgeworth: Gnngh! Phoenix: (I'm so lost... Who the heck am I supposed to be helping here...?) Mia: Calm down, Phoenix. Think carefully and relax. Judge: Now then, would the witness please continue? Leads back to cross-exmination It was not important. Phoenix: Why he meets his clients is not important. And that wasn't the point. Witness, please stop side-stepping my questions! de Killer: Wh-What do you mean by that? Phoenix: My question was \"Did you really meet Adrian Andrews in person?\" de Killer: I have already told you, Mr. Wright. I did. It was only through talking with him face to face that I began to trust him. That's when I thought, \"I can trust this person as a client.\" Judge: Hmm... It's true what they say about talking face to face. Well, Mr. Wright? Was the testimony just now of any importance? It was very important. Phoenix: (If I heard what I think I heard just now... Then I think I've got him.) Your Honor. I believe the testimony just now was of the utmost importance. Judge: Huh? Really? Edgeworth: If that's the case... Witness, please include the statement just now in your testimony. de Killer: Very well. Adds statement \"From the moment I saw him, I thought, \"I can trust this person as a client.\"\" It was not important. Phoenix: (I was so sure there was something, but I can't get a good grip on what it is...) Hmm, I guess it wasn't all that important. Judge: Very well. Mia: Phoenix. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: What did you hear just now? Phoenix: Um... Mia: Clean out your earwax and pay attention, Phoenix. You're letting his words slip by! Phoenix: (Um... I guess I missed something back there...?) Edgeworth: Witness, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press further (after adding statement) Phoenix: Witness! I would like for you to give us a few more details. de Killer: I always meet my clients as a matter of principle. I have never taken a request by telephone or mail. Edgeworth: And why is that? de Killer: That's because I value the trust between a client and myself above all else. And the only way to establish that is to speak to the client while looking them in the eye. Leads back to cross-examination Let it go Phoenix: (It's probably just my imagination... I need to find something more definitive to catch this guy on!) Can we believe that your testimony up to this point has been reliable? Leads back to cross-examinationde Killer: From the moment I saw him, I thought, \"I can trust this person as a client.\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But as we now know, that was not how it turned out, correct? de Killer: What do you mean? Phoenix: Adrian Andrews turned out to be a client who couldn't stick to the rules, right? de Killer: ...Well, yes. I suppose you are correct. Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: So I would like to check one last time. Are you sure your testimony is accurate?Present Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I would like to go over this one more time.\"de Killer: That is what occurred. I trust my memory, and I believe I have made no mistakes.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So your client was Adrian Andrews...? de Killer: That is correct. Phoenix: (Well, he says the two of them met... But if they did, then there shouldn't be anything wrong with De Killer's testimony...) Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: (Well, there doesn't seem to be anything strange this time around...)Mia: You have to draw more information from him, but you can't draw his suspicion. If you can do that, you should be able to find a flaw in his testimony somewhere.Phoenix: (Talk about a delicate balance...)Phoenix: I would like to go over this one more time. You met Adrian Andrews at a bar and took the request at that time?de Killer: Yes, that is correct.Phoenix: And that's when you thought \"he\" was trustworthy...de Killer: How many times must I repeat myself? Yes, that is correct.Phoenix: I'm sorry, but that is an impossible tale.de Killer: Wh-What!?Phoenix: Shelly de Killer. You have never met the real Adrian Andrews!de Killer: ...! Wh-Why would you say that...?Phoenix: Because you made one very big slip-up... ...about her.de Killer: So what is the issue... ...! Wh-What did you say just now...? About \"her\"...?Phoenix: If you had ever met Adrian Andrews in person... One look would have told you that she is a woman!de Killer: Ohoooooo!Judge: O-Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?Phoenix: This witness testified to the following: That he always meets face to face with his clients when taking their request.Judge: But he has never met Adrian Andrews in person...Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor! That is exactly the point! That means Mr. de Killer's client could not have been Ms. Adrian Andrews!de Killer: Ugnnn...Judge: Mr. Edgeworth... I understand your logic on this one... However... Why would the assassin make such a basic mistake?Edgeworth: I believe it has to do with her name, Your Honor.Judge: Her name?Edgeworth: Yes. Adrian Andrews is, without a doubt, a very androgynous name.Judge: Hmm... Yes, I see...Edgeworth: Unluckily for Mr. de Killer, the entire time he was on the stand, no one had stated Adrian Andrews' gender. And so, he simply picked the wrong gender to go with.Judge: Wh-What... What is going on...? Shelly de Killer! This court demands an explanation!de Killer: Umm... I-I think somehow... I must have mixed up this client with another.Edgeworth: So does that mean you remember something different now?de Killer: Yes, of course. Please, if you would allow me to testify once more...Phoenix: (Argh! I know he's just going to spit out more lies.)Judge: Very well. But this time, please give us the truth, and nothing but the truth!Witness Testimony-- Request Taking, Pt. 2 --de Killer: Yes, now I remember. I took that request by mail. There have been times when I took a job without having met my client. The request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things. When I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.Judge: Hmm... So you took this job through a letter...Phoenix: (He didn't mention anything about a letter in his earlier testimony... Which means he is definitely lying!)Mia: Be careful, Phoenix. If you break the assassin's testimony completely, it's over for us.Phoenix: I know... I can't make him suspicious. But... I think we're OK -- like we can do this. (As long as he's standing there across from me... No matter how strong of a punch I throw, he'll counter it...)Judge: Now then, let's begin the cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Request Taking, Pt. 2 --de Killer: Yes, now I remember. I took that request by mail.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But didn't you just say that you always meet your clients? de Killer: Yes, I suppose I did say that. However, there are some clients for whom a meeting is simply not possible. Phoenix: But didn't you meet your client this time? de Killer: No, I did not. Phoenix: Oh, come now. Let's stop with this game of cat and mouse. de Killer: Using your silkiest voice is not going to work on me. Phoenix: Alright then, just cough it up and confess! Judge: Mr. Wright! You can't badger a witness with such harsh words! Phoenix: Um... Judge: You're a lawyer, so behave like one and present evidence instead of mindlessly yelling. Now then, do you have any proof that Mr. de Killer met with his client? I have proof. Phoenix: (We've come this far! I have to try to prove something here!) Very well, I will show you proof. Mia: Are you sure about this, Phoenix? Phoenix: Here is the proof that the witness met with his client, who wished Mr. Corrida dead! Present anything Phoenix: Phoenix: So! What do you think!? de Killer: ... You may say, \"What do you think?\"... However, I am for all intents and purposes, a transceiver radio. Phoenix: Oh... That's right, you can't actually see the evidence... de Killer: Well, I don't think this was one I needed to see. I can hear the pure silence in the air there. Phoenix: (Argh! How could I have picked the wrong piece at a time like this!?) Judge: Hmm... In any case, let's continue with the testimony. Leads back to cross-examination I don't have any proof. Phoenix: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Unfortunately, I don't have any proof. Judge: Hmm, I see. Then your line of questioning was just another waste of time. Edgeworth: Sadly for us, Your Honor, that is the nature of Wright and wrong. Leads back to cross-examinationde Killer: There have been times when I took a job without having met my client.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why could you not meet certain clients? de Killer: Recently, I have been receiving more requests. If I met each and every client, I would lose some nice business opportunities. Judge: Nice business opportunities? de Killer: On top of which, the times have changed. It is now the age of information and computers, correct? Well I have joined the times, and now take requests via electronic mail. Judge: Electronic mail? Do you have to mail that in a special insulated envelope? de Killer: Ah, I'm very sorry. I despise the shortening of words. What I meant by electronic mail is what is commonly referred to as \"e-mail\". Judge: ... E-mail...? Phoenix: (In a contest of mimicry, the judge would beat a parrot, hands down...) Edgeworth: *ahem* Anyway, so you took this job without having met your client, and...?de Killer: The request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Two or three other things...? de Killer: Yes. Phoenix: And what were these \"other things\"? de Killer: A few other things that have nothing to do with this case. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (What should I do...? Should I let him slide with that...? It'd be really bad if I push his buttons the wrong way and he gets mad...) Press further Phoenix: Whether or not they're related to this case is for the court to decide. de Killer: ...Mr. Attorney. Phoenix: Y-Yes? de Killer: Everything I have said from the beginning has been nothing but beneficial to your client. Which is why I wonder what is pushing you to continue with this cross-examination. Phoenix: ...! de Killer: Could it be... That you are planning to betray your own client...? Phoenix: Th-That's... de Killer: I smell the stench of a backstabber. And should you turn out to be one... Phoenix: W-W-Wait! (Uh oh... This is looking really bad! I shouldn't press my luck. Alright, I have to think. Is this worth pursuing...?) Press further Phoenix: Witness, this is a very important matter. Please cooperate and tell us what these other \"jobs\" your client requested were... de Killer: ... If it's truly that important, I suppose I don't have much of a choice. The bear figurine. Phoenix: The bear figurine...? de Killer: After the assassination of the target, I was to find that figurine. I was told that this job was just as important as the actual killing. Phoenix: And... Where was that figurine...? de Killer: It was inside Mr. Corrida's suitcase. Phoenix: And then... what did you do next? de Killer: I handed it over to my client right away. Phoenix: You gave it to your \"client\"... Interesting. Judge: Hmm... This information certainly sounds important to me. Witness, please include what you just stated in your testimony. de Killer: As you wish. Adds statement \"One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews.\" Let it go Phoenix: (De Killer sounds like one sharp man... I should try to find a better way to do this without making him suspicious.) Judge: Let's continue with the testimony. Witness, if you please. Leads back to cross-examination Let it go Phoenix: (De Killer sounds like one sharp man... I should try to find a better way to do this without making him suspicious.) Judge: Let's continue with the testimony. Witness, if you please. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: Two or three other things...? de Killer: Yes. Phoenix: And what were these \"other things\"? de Killer: A few other things that have nothing to do with this case. Judge: Hmm...de Killer: One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I found this figurine at Mr. Engarde's mansion. If you gave it to Ms. Andrews, then what was it doing there? de Killer: I was waiting for her there. That was also part of the plan to frame Mr. Engarde, I'm sure... Judge: Hmm... That makes a lot of sense. Well, Mr. Wright? Do you have any problems with this piece of testimony? There is a contradiction Phoenix: (So De Killer says he gave the figurine to Ms. Andrews. But I know somewhere in that statement there is a contradiction... And yet... I know that if I present something trivial here...) Mia: ...He will cut the connection on his end. If you want to make a strong point, Phoenix... You have to present strong evidence. Phoenix: (She's right. So now what, Dr. Wright!?) Present evidence Phoenix: Witness, let's go over this one more time. You gave Ms. Andrews the bear figurine. And she told you to take the bear and wait for her at Engarde Mansion. Is that correct? de Killer: Yes... Where are you going with this...? Phoenix: Well, I think maybe you might have remembered a few things incorrectly. Judge: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (This is a battle of wits! I can't let up on him!) I don't think it is possible for Ms. Andrews to have been the recipient of this bear! Present Figurine or Celeste's Suicide Note Phoenix: Leads to: \"Shelly de Killer.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: So! What do you think!? de Killer: ... Phoenix: Witness! de Killer: ... Phoenix: Mr. de Killer! de Killer: Oh, I'm sorry. I went to visit the water closet for a second. Phoenix: ...Huh? de Killer: Mr. Attorney, I think it's time I stated this in terms even you can comprehend. Phoenix: ! de Killer: If you ask me any more of these pointless questions... There will be no mercy! Phoenix: Urk! de Killer: Now, I would like to move on with my testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Think it over again Phoenix: (It's no use... As long as I can't put my finger on the central problem here, pressing this witness any more would be extremely dangerous!) Judge: Hmm... It appears that Mr. Wright has no problems. Well then, witness. Please continue. Leads back to cross-examination No objections Phoenix: (It's no use... As long as I can't put my finger on the central problem here, pressing this witness any more would be extremely dangerous!) Judge: Hmm... It appears that Mr. Wright has no problems. Well then, witness. Please continue. Leads back to cross-examinationPresent Figurine or Celeste's Suicide Note Phoenix: Leads to: \"Shelly de Killer.\"de Killer: When I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're saying that you never saw your client's face. Not even once? de Killer: ... I did... Once. It was when I went to give my client the figurine. Judge: Hmm. Yes, I see. de Killer: But Ms. Andrews was wearing a mask at the time. Judge: A mask? Phoenix: (The Nickel Samurai mask, I'm guessing...?) Judge: Mr. Wright... What do you have to say about this? Do you have any problems with this piece of testimony? There is a contradiction Phoenix: One thing does sort of stick out at me, Your Honor. Witness. I think you most definitely saw your client's face. de Killer: ... Phoenix: Let's recall Mr. Powers' testimony. Powers: After the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room. Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume. Matt gave the bellboy a tip. Phoenix: You received quite a large roll of cash from Mr. Engarde! And at the time, he was not wearing his Nickel Samurai mask! de Killer: Ohoooooo! Judge: Order! Order! Yes, now that you mention it, I do remember that... Judge: Witness! de Killer: ... Yes, that night I did wander the floor as a bellboy. I received plenty of tips that night for carrying juice to the various rooms. Is that so wrong? Phoenix: Huh? de Killer: The man who gave me that tip was not my client. He was probably just a very generous person. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but sadly, we are not nearly so generous here. If I could receive large rolls of cash by simply bringing people things on trays... Then why on Earth would I stand around here prosecuting!? Phoenix: (Oh, the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu... And isn't his salary more than enough for one man...?) Judge: Hmm... And where is your evidence that the large roll of cash was not in fact, a tip...? Come, Mr. Edgeworth. Show me the money! Edgeworth: Whaaaat!? de Killer: Mr. Attorney. Phoenix: Y-Yes? de Killer: You know, I think your line of questioning has been a little strange... In fact, I would say you don't seem to believe Ms. Andrews is my client. Phoenix: Oh, no, it's not like that at all. I just think lies aren't a good thing, you know...? de Killer: Oh, I know and agree. Lies are not a good thing at all... Phoenix: Urk. de Killer: I think we are on the same page now, aren't we Mr. Attorney? Remember. If I feel threatened in any way... I am free to cut contact at any time... Phoenix: I'm sorry! Please forgive my foolishness! Judge: Hmm... If only you were this apologetic all the time... Anyway, I do not see a huge contradiction here. Therefore, you may continue, witness. Leads back to cross-examination No objections Phoenix: (I think I can pull something out of what he said... But it would be real bad if I did something and made him mad over something trivial!) There are no problems with the testimony, Your Honor. Judge: Hmm... Leads back to cross-examinationMia: We've pretty much reached the end of our rope here...Phoenix: Huh? Seems like we're still OK to me.Mia: And that's exactly what is so bad. At the rate we're going, we will end up completely destroying De Killer's lie. If we do that... You already know how serious of a situation that will put us in.Phoenix: O-Oh yeah...

    "cot": "Alright, let's break this down. We need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies given by Shelly de Killer. The testimonies are:\n\n0. Took the request by mail.\n1. Sometimes takes jobs without meeting clients.\n2. Request included murder and other tasks.\n3. One task was to give the bear figurine to Adrian Andrews.\n4. Thought the client was a man based on the name.\n\nThe relevant evidence includes the figurine (25) and Celeste's suicide note (27), among others. \n\nDe Killer's third testimony states he gave the figurine to Adrian Andrews. However, evidence 25 (Figurine) was found at Engarde's mansion, not with Andrews. If de Killer had given it to Andrews, why was it in Engarde's possession? This contradiction suggests that de Killer didn't actually give the figurine to Andrews, implying his client was someone else (Engarde). Therefore, testimony 3 is contradicted by evidence 25."

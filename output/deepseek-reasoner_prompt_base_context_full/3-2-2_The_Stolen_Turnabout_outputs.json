Gumshoe: Do you think you can swing by the detention center sometime? Phoenix: The detention center...? (Changed from [Detention center...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: He wants to talk to you... Mask\u2606DeMasque, that is. Maya: Whaaaat!? He wants to talk to Nick? Gumshoe: I'll be waiting for you, pal. So get over here soon. Phone: ...*beep*... Phoenix: (The detention center, huh?) October 12Atmey Detective Agency Phoenix: This is a detective agency? Looks like more like the set of some B-grade horror movie. Maya: H-Hello? Is anyone here...? ... Phoenix: It looks like nobody's home. Maya: Hmph. What a waste of time. Hey! I know! Let's take that framed picture back with us as a memento! Phoenix: Don't you dare, Maya! (Guess we'll have to try back later...) Examine Gramophone Maya: Hey, Nick. What's this thing here? Phoenix: It's called a \"gramophone\". In the old days, people used them to listen to music. Maya: You can't be serious! I think it's probably for purifying the air or something. I'll bet you 50 cents! Come on, what do you say? Phoenix: Forget it. You never pay up when you lose. Luke Atmey painting Phoenix: What a creepy painting. It's like he's looking right at me. Maya: Maybe we should put up a big portrait of you in the office, Nick! I can even paint it for you. Maybe you can pose while cleaning the toilet? Phoenix: ...I think I'd prefer something a bit more dignified. Fireplace Maya: Whoa! It's a huge hearth! Phoenix: That's a fireplace. Maya: So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick! Phoenix: R-Right... sorry. Bookshelf Phoenix: That's one impressive bookshelf filled with some very impressive books! Maya: \"My Life as an Ace Detective: Unabridged Edition\" by Luke Atmey, Ace Detective. Phoenix: Hey, he's even got one of those ships in a bottle thingies. Maya: Ah! Would you look at that! There's a little Luke Atmey doll at the helm! How cute! Phoenix: There's a microscope here, too. I wonder if he was researching something. The glass slides have different names on them. Maya: This one says... \"Atmey Virus\", ...Hmm. This guy is just dying to make a name for himself, huh. Phoenix: It's getting kind of irritating, actually. Desk Phoenix: This desk is literally covered with all sorts of chemistry equipment. Maya: Oh, I just love chemistry! Say, Nick, I bet you didn't know this, but... Water is made up of carbon and hydrogen! Phoenix: No, no, no. Not carbon! Oxygen! Oxygen and hydrogen! Maya: Oh? Well, there are always alternative theories, I guess. Phoenix: (If by \"alternative theories\" you mean the ones you make up inside that head of yours.) October 12 Detention CenterVisitor's Room Gumshoe: Hey, pal! Welcome to the detention center! Phoenix: You're sure in a happy mood, aren't you? Gumshoe: Yup. After all, we got Mask\u2606DeMasq-- Maya: Right, but... Um... So where's the Sacred Urn? Gumshoe: Oh, Sorry about that, pal... I guess I didn't really think about it before... But you're the \"victim\" in this case. Maya: Huh? Gumshoe: Well, I guess I should let you guys hear the story straight from the horse's mouth. Maya: You know, he's right, Nick! Phoenix: He is? Maya: If you think about it reeeeal hard, we are the victims! Phoenix: Well... I guess so... In a way... ???: Umm... Maya: I'm so used to thinking of the victim as a dead person 'cause we're always on murder cases. ???: Ex-Excuse me... Maya: But anyway! I have to get the Sacred Urn back! ???: Pleeeeease! Don't just ignore meeeeee! ...Err. Maya: ...Um, who are you? ???: ...I, err, umm. I-I-I... I-I'm Ma-Ma-Ma... Mask\u2606DeMasque...? ...O-OK? Maya: ... Hey, Nick... Doesn't he look kind of... well, gangly? Ron: I'm Ron DeLite... Th-The famous Mask\u2606DeMasque. Phoenix: (...I don't think this guy could punch his way out of a wet paper bag.) Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He looks nervous being this close to an alleged thief. Talk Mask\u2606DeMasque Phoenix: So, you're the Masque DeMask guy? Ron: Y-Yes! You bet! ... No... Err, that's wrong. You see... it's complicated. Sort of yes, and sort of no. If you know what I mean Pearl: Hm? What's wrong? Ron: Well when I say \"wrong\", what I really mean to say is that it's \"not right\", per se. You see it's not spelled \"Masque DeMask\", it's actually \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\"... Maya: ...What's with this guy? Phoenix: (Well, he's a timid little weakling, we know that much.) Ron: D-Don't do that... Don't look at me like that! I don't need your pityyyyy! Phoenix: (And a major crybaby, too.) So... Why did you give yourself up? Ron: Well, you see... It's because... Well... Maya: I know why! It's because you stole such a priceless treasure! And now you're overwhelmed with guilt. Am I right!? Phoenix: (\"Priceless treasure\"? That broken old urn...?) Ron: Umm... I have a little favor to ask... Phoenix: Y-Yes? What is it? Ron: Could you... go and talk to Dessie? Maya: ...D-Dessie? Sacred Urn Maya: Look, we really want our urn back, so where is it? Ron: I'm sorry! I'll give it back! I really will! ...Err, maybe not. No, I can't... I can't make promises I can't keep... I'll just end up hurting people Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick...? I couldn't hear what he just said... Especially the last part. Phoenix: Um, Mr. DeMasque? Do you think you could speak up a little? Ron: Y-Y-Y-Yes, sir! I will... I promise! ...Err, maybe not. You see, I'm already speaking in my normal voice, so I really can't do anything Maya: Mr. DeMasque? About the urn... Ron: Oh! Yes! The urn! Right away! ...Err, actually no. I wouldn't mind telling you, but actually I'm afraid you wouldn't believe me anyway Maya: Enough already! Just tell it to us straight! Ron: Please... Please don't yell at meeee! *huff huff huff* I... I... I'm sorry... That urn... I... I-I lost it! Maya: Wh-Wha-What!? Lost it? (appears after \"Sacred Urn\") Phoenix: What did you just say? Did you say you \"lost it\"? Ron: Yes... Er, no. Umm... Maybe so. I mean, yes, I lost it! Maya: Wh-What do you mean...? Ron: Well, you know... I lost it, like I said... These things just happen... You're on the train and you get distracted and you forgot your bag. You know... Maya: What!? You forgot our Sacred Urn on a train!? Phoenix: Wait a minute! You went on the train dressed like that!? Ron: N-No! I... I... I was just speaking hypothetically, that's all. A-Anyway... I'm sooooorry! I just lost it somewhere! I don't know where! Phoenix: ... (This guy's story is more surreal than a Dali painting.) Maya: Are you really sure this creep is Mask\u2606DeMasque? Phoenix: Maya, don't call him a \"creep\". (Although I do have to admit, I understand your doubts about this guy...) Dessie (appears after \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\") Phoenix: So who is this Dessie person? Ron: ...! Pleeeease don't talk about my wife like that! Maya: ...I-I guess she must be his wife... Ron: *huff huff huff* I'm sorry! The truth is... It was my wife that told me to have you all come here... Um... Do you think you could go and visit her at my hideout? Phoenix: H... Hideout? Pearl: Mr. Nick! What does he mean by \"hideout\"...? Ron: Oh, sorry. Naturally, I meant to say my \"secret base\". Phoenix: S-Secret base? Ron: Well, my apartment actually. Palazzo Pelpepe, 3rd floor... Maya: Let's go have a look, Nick! To Mask\u2606DeMasque's hideout! Phoenix: (Something tells me she just likes the sound of the word \"hideout\".) Present Treasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn Ron: I'm really sorry I caused so much trouble. Maya: If you're so sorry, then you shouldn't have stolen it in the first place! Ron: B-But... The only thing I did wrong was lose it! ...Err, that's not right. I was wrong either way. I'm sure the owners of the other treasures fell the same Maya: ...He sure seems sorry. Pearl: Who would have imagined that such a famous thief would have such a pure heart... DeMasque's Calling Card Ron: Oh! That's Mask\u2606DeMasque's calling card! Pretty nice-looking, huh!? Maya: He looks so happy... Ron: I'm not very good at writing, you see... So I bought a book called \"How to Write Business Letters\" and studied hard! Phoenix: (Well, I guess you could call thievery a type of business...) Mask\u2606DeMasque profile Ron: Ever since I was a little boy, I've always been interested in mysterious masked men! Phoenix: So that's what you wanted to be when you grew up? Ron: Yes! ...Err, no. Sort of, but not exactly... I never imagined I'd feel as bad as I do now about the treasures being stolen... Phoenix: (...People sure can be complicated, can't they.) Luke Atmey profile Ron: H-Him...! Phoenix: Do you know him? He claims to be your arch-enemy and rival. Ron: Th-That person... He... He's not my arch-enemy OR my rival! ...Well, actually, no. Now that I think about it, the terms arch-enemy and rival are the same thing Maya: They ARE rivals! Only people who have it out for each other would disagree like this! Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this? Ron: Hmm... I don't really think I can help you with that. Err, no, that's not it... Well... The thing is... I don't really know if I can say one way or the other Maya: I didn't really catch that. Phoenix: Don't worry, you didn't miss anything. After clearing \"Dessie\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: October 12 Mask\u2606DeMasque's Hideout Phoenix: ... Wow, check this place out! Maya: No doubt about it, this is Mask\u2606DeMasque's hideout alright. ???: Who is it? Is that you, Ronnie? Huh? Who are you people? Phoenix: Err, umm... Are you \"Dessie\" DeLite? (Changed from [Err, umm... Are you Desir\u00e9e DeLite?] in the original release) Desir\u00e9e: That's right. I'm Desir\u00e9e. ... Ah! Oh! You must be the lawyer... and the victim! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, that's us. Your husband told us to stop by and speak with you. (Changed from [Y-Yeah, that's us. Your husband told us that you wanted us to stop by.] in the original release) Maya: I'm Maya Fey, and this is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Desir\u00e9e: \"Nicky boy\" and Maya, huh? I can't tell you how grateful I am that you decided to help my Ronnie. Maya: Well, um... Aha ha... You're welcome. Phoenix: (Did she really call me \"Nicky boy\"?) Examine Hot air balloon Maya: Oh, that's so cute! It's called a hot air balloon, you know! Phoenix: ...Wow! There's no fooling you! Maya: I want to make my own balloon now! I'll even let you ride in it, Nick! Phoenix: (That emblem on the balloon is supposed to be top-secret. That's proof enough that Ron DeLite really is Mask\u2606DeMasque. I'd better not tell Maya. She gets kinda... scary when it comes to \"celebrities\"...) Piled stuff on left Phoenix: There's a whole bunch of stuff piled up over here. Maya: Duck and cover! It-It's a missile! Did you know there's d-dynamite in missiles!? Phoenix: But they're not heavy enough to be real... Oh wait. They're just really well-made toys. Maya: What are these rolls of paper stuck in the trash can? \"Theft of the Mazarin Stone: The Great Albatross Strategy\" \"Theft of the Immortal Goddess Statue: The Great Knucklebomber Strategy\" Phoenix: ... (Did the police even investigate this place...?) Green envelope Maya: Hey, Nick! Look on top of the chair! Phoenix: Looks like an envelope... And a letter. Maya: Well, don't just stand there! Come on, let's read it! Phoenix: Maya, you know we shouldn't do that! Maya: What are you talking about? That letter could be an important clue! Phoenix: No way. You can't just go reading a private letter because you feel like it. Maya: ...Hmph! It's not just because I \"feel like it\". It really could be important! Phoenix: (If I was sure it was a clue, I guess I wouldn't mind...) Masks and beard Phoenix: It's a bunch of cheap costume pieces arranged inside a nice frame. Maya: L-Look, Nick! It's a fake beard! Phoenix: There's also a mask made out of cardboard... Maya: Hey, Nick! Try on this fake beard! Come on! Try it on! Phoenix: H-Hey! Cut it out... Maya: Now put on the mask! ... Aha ha ha ha ha ha! It's Phoenix\u2606DeMasque! Let's borrow it for a while. Phoenix: (No way! I'm not stealing from a thief! I have enough bad karma as is!) Helmet and transceiver Phoenix: (Hmmm... This thing looks vaguely familiar.) Maya: Oh, I know! It's a fishbowl! Well, an upside-down one, anyway... Phoenix: I think it's a helmet. ...An alien helmet. Maya: And that looks like a tape recorder or something next to it. Phoenix: I think it's a transceiver. ...An alien transceiver. Maya: Nick... Do you think maybe you could act like a grown-up for a little bit? Phoenix: (Getting lectured by Maya to be more of an adult. That's a new low...) Mask\u2606DeMasque model Maya: It's Mask\u2606DeMasque! Phoenix: There's a tape recorder hanging from his neck. Maya: Let me see that! ...click... DeMasque: Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... I'll be taking this crown now! Better luck next time, gentlemen! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... Maya: ... I don't get it... What's this supposed to be, Nick? Torpedo Maya: Nick! It-It's a torpedo! Phoenix: ...It's hard to believe, but it sure looks real. Maya: Where could he have picked up something like this? Phoenix: Please don't say that torpedoes are things people just leave lying around. Books Phoenix: There are a bunch of books lying here. They're all romantic-sounding novels about famous heists and fantastic thieves. Maya: Wow! Look at all the bookmarks and notes stuck into them! Phoenix: Let's see here... \"Note: Must remember this thief's way of laughing. Very useful.\" \"Note: A calling card is an important part of any good thief's modus operandi!\" Maya: ... Phoenix: W-Wow, Ron really studied his stuff! Talk Ron DeLite Phoenix: Umm, about your husband... Desir\u00e9e: Hee hee, isn't he cutest? A bit weak sometimes though... Phoenix: ...\"A bit\"? Desir\u00e9e: By the way, did you know they mentioned Maya on TV? Maya: Huh? Really!? Desir\u00e9e: They said you own the urn and that you're doing some shady training at a law office now. Phoenix: (Remind me not to watch that channel's news program.) Desir\u00e9e: After I saw that, I thought it might be a good idea to meet the lawyer they mentioned. Phoenix: ...I see. Desir\u00e9e: My Ronnie... He has a powerful imagination and gets deluded easily. He kept insisting he was going to surrender to the police. I didn't know what to do! \"It was me! I stole that urn!\" he kept saying! As if it was even possible! Maya: Huh...? B-But... Are you saying he didn't? Desir\u00e9e: Ha ha ha. Of course he didn't! Why would my Ronnie ever do something like that? Maya: W-Well, you know... It's a p-priceless treasure! And-And he's... You know... Phoenix: (...Is it possible his own wife doesn't know his secret identity?) Desir\u00e9e DeLite Desir\u00e9e: Me? I'm the kind of woman that needs excitement in her life! Maya: Oh... Excitement, huh? Desir\u00e9e: Yes. I'm at my happiest when I'm racing along with my bike going at full throttle. Riding a motorcycle is like putting your life on the line. You know what I mean? Phoenix: (Well, I think that depends on how you ride it...) Desir\u00e9e: I'm the type that can't stand living a boring, dreary old life with no action. Maya: No offense, but your husband, Ron, doesn't exactly look like the risk-taking type himself. Desir\u00e9e: You're right about that. He's definitely not one for thrills and danger. But I do have to say that he makes up for it in other ways. Phoenix: Other ways...? Desir\u00e9e: Yes, money... Ronnie is incredibly rich... And super generous. He bought me a bike that's so fast it would make your head spin. And shopping? I like to shop so much it makes Ron's head spin. The other day, it actually happened. His head actually started to spin. Phoenix: (Man, talk about a high maintenance wife...) Maya: So where does Mr. DeLite get all this money from? Desir\u00e9e: Ronnie is a security guard. They put their lives on the line, right? So they get paid tons of money in return. Tons of it. Phoenix: (He's a security guard...? I think it's my turn for my head to spin...) The night of the crime (appears after \"Desir\u00e9e DeLite\") Phoenix: Can you tell us about what happened last night? Desir\u00e9e: Hmm, what time did that incident take place again? Phoenix: What time was it again, Maya? Maya: Well, according to Detective Gumshoe, it was around 1:30 in the morning. Desir\u00e9e: Ah, last night was horrible. I got pulled over! Maya: P-Pulled over? Desir\u00e9e: Yes... I always do my best flying at night! Phoenix: \"Flying\"...? Um, you're talking about your motorcycle, right? Desir\u00e9e: Yes. Anyway, last night I got pulled over. By a policeman. I can't believe he caught up to me! It was a great chase, let me tell you! When he finally caught me, the poor man was as white as a sheet. It was about three in the morning when I finally got home. Phoenix: (Sounds like she's got an airtight alibi...) Maya: Well, what about Mr. DeLite? Desir\u00e9e: I don't really know... We weren't together at that time of the night. But when I got home, he was already fast asleep. Phoenix: (So basically he's got no alibi...) Delusions (appears after presenting Mask\u2606DeMasque profile) Phoenix: So... When did Ron first become Mask\u2606DeMasque? Desir\u00e9e: What are you talking about? He's not Mask\u2606DeMasque! Phoenix: Huh? But... W-Wait a second! Look around at this room! This place is obviously Mask\u2606DeMasque's hideout... Desir\u00e9e: No no, you're totally wrong. A real thief's hideout wouldn't look like this! It's because Ronnie is so timid himself that he looks up to heroic figures. Maya: Heroic figures? But Mask\u2606DeMasque is a bad guy. Phoenix: (So he's \"deluded\", huh... Could that really be true?) Desir\u00e9e: Anyway, if he really had stolen the urn, wouldn't he still have it? Phoenix: W-Well, I suppose so... Desir\u00e9e: Then why don't you ask him if he has the urn or not? Phoenix: (She has a point. Mr. DeLite isn't exactly the criminal type... But something about Ron's behavior bothers me.) Maya: Maybe it's true... Maybe Mr. DeLite isn't Mask\u2606DeMasque after all. Present Treasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue, Sacred Urn, or Shichishito Desir\u00e9e: Ooh! That's so mysterious looking... I love old stuff like this! Maya: Really!? That's one of our most treasured possessions! There's going to be a whole exhibit at Lordly Tailor with these types of things! Phoenix: (Maya looks so happy. She's lit up like a 1,000 watt bulb.) Desir\u00e9e: Terrific! You can count on Ronnie and me to be there! Sounds like fun! Maya: Huh! ...Oh, err, yeah... Ha ha ha... Phoenix: (Oops, looks like that light bulb is starting to flicker.) DeMasque's Calling Card Phoenix: Umm, so what do you know about this...? Maya: No! You can't show her that, Nick! That emblem is top-secret! Don't you remember!? Phoenix: ...Doh! Oops, sorry about that. (But the way she just said \"top-secret\" was a worse giveaway than what I did...) Desir\u00e9e: Ooh! When I hear the word \"top-secret\", it just piques my interest like nothing else! Phoenix Wright profile Desir\u00e9e: So, Nicky boy, you're a lawyer, huh? Phoenix: Well, yeah. Desir\u00e9e: How do you like it? I bet it's SO exciting! Phoenix: ...Yeah, sometimes. Actually, a little too exciting at times. Desir\u00e9e: Oooh! I just love a good thrill. Hmm... Nicky boy... It sounds like you have it so nice... Phoenix: (Um... This is starting to get awkward.) Maya Fey profile Desir\u00e9e: That's really amazing! A \"Master\" at your age! Maya: Oh no, you've got it wrong. It's my mother that's the current Master! Desir\u00e9e: Oh, I see... So what exactly is she the master of anyway? Maya: Well, you see, it's li- Phoenix: Don't say it, Maya. If you say \"spirit channeling\", she'll laugh. Maya: Ouch... That hurt. Mask\u2606DeMasque profile Phoenix: ...Um, Ms. DeLite. You must know, right? About your husband and Mask\u2606DeMasque... Desir\u00e9e: Mask\u2606DeMasque? Of course. I know all about it. My husband is his biggest fan. Maya: Yup... Wha...? ...Huh? Phoenix: B-Biggest fan? Desir\u00e9e: Yes, and Ronnie can be pretty delusional sometimes. That's how this whole misunderstanding happened. Phoenix: W-Wait a minute! Did you say \"delusional\"!? Desir\u00e9e: Yes, that's right. I just don't know what I'm going to do with him... You see, Ronnie actually believes that HE is Mask\u2606DeMasque! Maya: WH-WHAAAAT!? What are you talking about!? Ron DeLite profile Desir\u00e9e: I know he doesn't look it... But he can really get things done when he puts his mind to it. Maya: Really? So when exactly does he put his mind to it? Desir\u00e9e: ...Well. Not very often, I admit. Phoenix: (What exactly does Ms. DeLite see in her husband anyway?) Maya: Wow, you must've really seen skyrockets when you first met to love him so much! Phoenix: Skyrockets...? I didn't know people still used that word. Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile Desir\u00e9e: As long as I've got my motorcycle and my Ronnie, I'm happy. Maya: Oh! That's so sweet! Desir\u00e9e: Oh, that plus a little excitement and a little shopping money! ...THEN I'm happy. Maya: Now she's starting to sound a bit greedy... Don't you think, Nick? Anything else Phoenix: Excuse me, but would you take a look at this...? Desir\u00e9e: Oh, I'm sorry... I haven't the faintest idea. I guess I just don't get out enough. After clearing all Talk options: Desir\u00e9e: Say... Can I ask you something, Nicky boy? Phoenix: What is it? Desir\u00e9e: I know I may seem like a \"bad girl\" on the outside... But the one thing I won't stand for is illegal activity. Maya: I had the feeling you wouldn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart. (Changed from [I had the feeling you didn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart.] in the original release) Desir\u00e9e: Somebody framed my poor Ronnie, I just know it. Umm... Could you give this to Ronnie for me? Maya: A letter? Desir\u00e9e: Yes, for Ronnie. I want him to fight back. Maya: Ms. DeLite... OK, you've got it! Just relax and leave it all to us! Desir\u00e9e's Letter added to the Court Record. Present Desir\u00e9e's Letter Desir\u00e9e: Could you please give that to my Ronnie? The contents are very important. Phoenix: (*sigh* Back to the detention center I go...) Detention Center Present Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile Ron: That's my lovely wife! Isn't she beautiful? Phoenix: Yeah, she sure is... Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: (Whoo boy. The one topic I didn't want to get into in front of Pearls...) Ron: But... Dessie doesn't approve of my... \"interests\". So I'm afraid she doesn't like me anymore... What should I do? If I want to win her back, I'm really going to have to be super honest. Phoenix: (Oh boy. he's gone back into his own little world again...) Desir\u00e9e's Letter Phoenix: ...Oh, that's right! Here. This is from your wife. Ron: Oh? From Dessie!? Thank you! Letter given to Mask\u2606DeMasque. ... Actually, more like \"taken\". Ron: \"My dear Ronnie, how are you? I'm doing fine...\" ... Phoenix: (He's clutching onto that letter so hard, the ink is going to be squeezed out...) Maya: He looks so happy... Pearl: You should write a letter to Mystic Maya too, Mr. Nick! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Desir\u00e9e's Letter: Ron: ... Umm... Mr. Lawyer? Phoenix: Yes? Ron: In the letter that Dessie wrote, she said... \"Ask this guy to be your lawyer!\" Maya: Huh...? Ron: Err, umm... I know this would be asking a lot, but... Could you please take my case? My trial starts tomorrow... Maya: Hey, hang on a second! He can't be your lawyer! Phoenix: Why not? Maya: What do you mean, \"why not\"!? We're the victims in this case, right!? Victims of this DeMasque guy! Phoenix: Well, yeah... But according to Desir\u00e9e, he didn't do it... Pearl: She said, \"Poor man, he's deluded himself into thinking he did it.\" Right, Mr. Nick? Maya: Come on! She could be lying to protect her husband! Phoenix: W-Well, that's true. ...Err, no actually not. Actually it's hard to say (...Oh no, it's spreading!) Ron: Oh, please! I'll give you the treasure of your choice in return... Phoenix: (Hmm... What should I do?) Take his case Phoenix: ...Well, Mr. DeLite, I've decided to give it a try. I'll defend you. Ron: Really? You will? Maya: Hey! What're you doing, Nick!? Pearl: He... He's a thief! You can't trust him! Phoenix: Well, he may be a thief... But I think there's more to this case than meets the eye. Leads to: \"M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\" Refuse his case Maya: Don't do it, Nick! He's a thief! Pearl: Mr. Nick! I agree with Mystic Maya! Phoenix: (Well, I admit something about this guy stinks like last week's sushi. I guess I really should say no. But... If I do that, this poor guy will have nobody on his side!) ...Well, Mr. DeLite, I've decided to take your case. Ron: Really? You will? Leads to: \"M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\" Pearl: M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you! Phoenix: P-Pearls...? Pearl: I can't believe you'd defend this person after what he did to Mystic Maya...! I-I... I'll never forgive you... EVER! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! Maya: P-! Pearly...! Wait! Phoenix: (This is going to be ugly...) Maya: I-I'll go after her! Ron: Umm... Sorry about that. I didn't mean to cause any trouble... Phoenix: Well... You couldn't have known she'd react like that. (I guess I might as well start investigating...) Oh, Maya... Where's Pearls? Maya: She said she's going back to the office. Go check in on her later, would you? Phoenix: And what about you...? Are you OK with me taking Mr. DeLite's case...? Maya: Y-Yeah... I'm fine, Nick. I believe in you. Phoenix: ... *sniffle* (I think I'm going to cry.) Ron: Umm... I, err... I know you have a lot of work to do... I... I really appreciate it. Maya: OK, Nick! Let's get this show on the road! Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. The camera doesn't seem to have a lot to tape right now. The only thing it's watching now is that guard over there. Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. It looks like he doesn't have much to do right now. I can tell because he's looking at the camera and making funny faces. October 12Wright & Co. Law Offices Pearl: Ah... Mr. Nick! W-Welcome back! Phoenix: Oh, hey Pearls. You're back too, I see. Pearl: I, um... I went and bought us a strawberry cake! I'll go make some tea to go with it! Phoenix: Hey, uh Pearls... ... Maya: It looks like she feels really bad about what happened at the detention center... Pearl: M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you! Pearl: I-I... I'll never forgive you... EVER! Pearl: Mystic Maya! The tea is ready! Maya: Oh... Thanks... Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Please have some of this cake! Phoenix: Yeah... Thanks. Umm, Pearls? Pearl: Oh! Ex-Excuse me... I was in the middle of cleaning the toilet...! Phoenix: Hey, it's OK! I just cleaned it this morning... Maya: Too late... Phoenix: (...This might be a good time for me to ask about her.) Examine Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. When she was alive, Mia really loved it. She even went so far as to make it our mascot. No matter how busy I get, I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so the dust bunnies are starting to mount their assault. Hm? Today it's sparkly clean. I guess Pearls must've wiped them out for me. Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. These were all Mia's... Wow, I just realized I didn't buy a single one of these. Talk Pearl Phoenix: (I first met Pearls a year ago... It was when that murder happened at Kurain Village. I still remember what she said to me when we first met...) Pearl: You... You're Mr. Nick, right? You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"... Phoenix: ...Hey, Maya. I've always thought it was because she was young, but... Maya: But what...? Phoenix: Pearls... I think she's got the wrong idea. About... you and me. (Changed from [About... you and I.] in the original release) Maya: Huh!? Err, I... ...Umm...There's something you need to understand... Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Maya: Umm... It's kind of like a Kurain Village custom... Sort of. Maya Phoenix: Pearls seems to love you a lot. Maya: Well, it's because I'm her only cousin. And... well... Because of the murder case last year, Pearly's mother is... Phoenix: Oh yeah... Phoenix: (I remember now... Pearls's mother, Morgan Fey... She's serving a prison term in isolation right now...) Maya: So you see? I'm the only family Pearly has right now... But... It's the same for me, too. Phoenix: Maya... Maya: My mother's gone, too... Kurain Village Custom (appears after \"Pearl\") Maya: There are hardly any men in Kurain Village. Phoenix: Now that you mention it, I never actually saw any men there when I visited. Maya: I'm pretty sure I told you about it a long time ago... About how spiritual powers run very strong in the Fey family. Phoenix: Yeah, you did. And that's why you're undergoing training to be a spirit medium, right? Maya: Yeah... The thing is, only women can actually inherit the spiritual power. That's why the whole culture of Kurain Village kinda revolves around its women. Phoenix: Well, that's understandable... Nothing wrong with that. Maya: Yeah, but because of that... There tends to be a lot of unsuccessful marriages. Phoenix: Oh? Maya: Well, men start to feel left out after a while, and then they just start leaving. ...Especially if the man has a daughter. Phoenix: Are you saying that Pearls's father...? Maya: ...He's gone. He left the village when she was very young. Phoenix: Boy, that's tough... Maya: Yeah, and she grew up seeing nothing but unhappy marriages all around her. That's why she's so sensitive to things like that. Maya's mother (appears after \"Maya\") Phoenix: So your mother's still missing...? Maya: Yeah... And no one has any idea where she is. Phoenix: (Maya's mother... Misty Fey. The current Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She disappeared 17 years ago after getting involved in a certain police case.) Phoenix: ...But you're sure she's still alive, right? Maya: Yeah... I know she is... It's sort of a spirit medium thing... Phoenix: And if your mother doesn't come back, then what...? Maya: Then according to the laws of the village, I'll become the next Master. Phoenix: Mystic Maya... The Master of the Kurain Technique... Sounds like a heavy responsibility. Maya: Yeah, but there's no one else with the blood of the Fey main family who's a spirit medium. Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Treasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn Maya: You know, I thought we'd finally found the urn. Phoenix: Yeah, if only Ron DeLite were Mask\u2606DeMasque, we'd have figured it all out. Maya: Huh? You mean he's NOT Mask\u2606DeMasque? Phoenix: Well, Desir\u00e9e says he isn't and I believe her. Maya: Hmm... The mystery gets deeper and deeper. Phoenix: Yeah, and the trial starts tomorrow... as usual. DeMasque's Calling Card Phoenix: So this was made by the real Mask\u2606DeMasque, huh? Maya: Yup, Detective Gumshoe said it was the real thing. \"One look at this mark and you know it's the real deal, pal.\" Phoenix: Yeah, but you do realize whose deductive reasoning skills we're talking about, right...? Shichishito Maya: This sword... It has a strange aura surrounding it. It's like it's infused with a spirit of both anger and tragedy. Phoenix: Well, I'd be mad too if somebody bent me the way they bent this sword. Maya: ...Yeah, I guess that could be it. Phoenix Wright profile Maya: When did you first get that porcupine cut? Phoenix: ...Um, it's been like this ever since I was a little kid. Maya: What!? You mean that's the way your hair is naturally? I thought you had some sort of special \"Phoenix Cut\" deal with the barber. I mean... You usually only see hair like that in a video game. Mia Fey profile Phoenix: If it wasn't for Mia, I wouldn't be the person I am today. Maya: Yeah, she told me you used to really be useless. Compared to how unreliable you were then, you actually seem responsible now. ...Actually, you haven't changed that much, I guess. Phoenix: (Maya praised me for a change! ...Hey, wait a second...) Pearl Fey profile Maya: I'm so sorry that Pearly said what she did. Phoenix: Oh, It's fine... It-It was nothing... (I'm going to have to smooth things over with Pearls later somehow...) Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Detective Gumshoe's on this case too, huh. Phoenix: He seems to show up during all of our cases. It can't be a coincidence. Maya: Maybe it's a sign that our fates are destined to be woven together for all time! Phoenix: Yeah, that'd be a real Beauty and the Beast kind of fairy tale, wouldn't it. Mask\u2606DeMasque or Ron DeLite profile Maya: So the real identity of Mask\u2606DeMasque is... ...Ron DeLite, right? Phoenix: That's what Mr. DeLite claims. ...But I'm not too convinced about something he said. Maya: Huh? About what? Phoenix: About the Sacred Urn. Didn't he sound a little vague on the subject? Maya: Yeah, now that you mention it, he said that he simply \"lost it\", right? Phoenix: (I have this distinct feeling that he's hiding something. I just know it...) Luke Atmey profile Maya: That Detective Atmey guy really surprised me. There was this certain something about the way he said, \"Zvarri!\" Phoenix: Well he did manage to get back the treasure that the Mask guy stole last time, right? And he did it by himself, too. Maya: Yeah, I guess. ...That case has certainly made him famous. Phoenix: It looks like he does deserve to be called \"Ace Detective\" after all. Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile Maya: That Desir\u00e9e sure is cool! I love that whole motorcycle thing! The way she laughs in the face of death... I want to try it myself! Phoenix: I thought you only knew how to ride a bike... Maya: Hey! Don't forget, Nick, that it's an electric bike! Phoenix: ...E-Electric? So young and already so lazy. Whatever happened to good old exercise? Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this? Maya: Hmmm... It seems like it has something to do with this case... But I'm not really sure... After clearing all Talk options: Maya: Well, Nick! Why don't we go out and start investigating? We're not going to learn anything just sitting around the office! Phoenix: Yeah, I know... But... First I want to talk to Pearls... Pearl: ...Umm, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah...? Pearl: I... I acted like a baby. Phoenix: Pearls... Pearl: I doubted you... Even though Mystic Maya trusted you completely... I guess I still have a lot of training to do. Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Pearl: I... From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for what I said! Phoenix: Aww, it's OK! I'm the one that should be apologizing! Pearl: Well, I'm going out now for a little bit. Phoenix: Huh!? Wh-Where are you going...? Pearl: I may be small, but I still have a lot of spirit channeling power! So I'm going to show you I can be useful too... By finding some evidence! Phoenix: Hey! W-Wait a...! (Ack! She sure runs fast...) Maya: Nick... Let's back off and give her some room, OK? Phoenix: ...Yeah. October 12Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall Andrews: M-Maya...! Maya: Oh, Ms. Andrews... Andrews: I'm so sorry! It's my fault! ...Your precious urn! Your... precious... UUUUURNNN!!! Phoenix: Please! C-Calm down! What's wrong? Andrews: *sniffle* It never ends! Everything I touch ends in failure! Maya, I'm sorry...! I'll do anything to make it up to you! Maya: N-No, it's okay, don-- Andrews: I know I don't look it, but I'm good with my hands. I could make you another urn. Maya: Hold on, just wait, OK? Breathe, calm down and talk to us. Andrews: F-Forgive me! Forgive me! Examine Cushion Phoenix: That's probably where the Sacred Urn was going to be displayed. Maya: Yeah, I guess so... Phoenix: Should I put my attorney's badge there? You know, as a replacement? Maya: Hmm... I think it's a little too small for that. What about my Magatama? Phoenix: Now you're being silly... That's definitely too small. Folding screen Maya: It's the folding screen of Kurain Sacred Writings. But I can't read what it says on it. Phoenix: Really? But I thought it was some kind of important spell! Maya: Ahh, yeah. My mother read it and taught me to memorize it. I'll be in trouble if I ever forget it. Phoenix: (Looks like the Kurain Channeling School is teetering dangerously on the edge...) Kurain Village diorama Maya: Wow, this is incredible! It's a tiny version of my Kurain Village! Hey! I've got a great idea! We can make a miniature of your office, Nick! Phoenix: I don't know about that. The whole place is overflowing with junk. You'd die before you finish painstakingly recreating that mess. Maya: Well, we could always clean it up first. Phoenix: *shrug* True. Talk DeMasque's calling card Phoenix: Umm... So when did you get the calling card from Mask\u2606DeMasque? Andrews: Let's see... Exactly 10 days ago. I was going to show it to the police... But that detective stopped me. Maya: Um, so you asked Detective Atmey to help with security? Andrews: Yes. In fact, it was about 20 days ago that I hired him. He seemed to know much more about Mask\u2606DeMasque than the police. Phoenix: So you hired him for security even before the calling card arrived? Andrews: Well, yes. I had a premonition that something bad might happen... I've learned to trust my hunches! Phoenix: So that's why there are security cameras, even in the basement warehouse? Andrews: Yes. Lordly Tailor is very serious about their security measures. It was their way of saying, \"Bring it on!\" to any potential thieves... Phoenix: (Well, he sure \"brought it\" last night... And even left with a nice souvenir.) The security Maya: Um, can you tell us a bit about the security for the Treasure Exhibit? Andrews: It was all my fault! I never should have called this paltry little collection a \"treasure exhibit\" anyway... Phoenix: Why do you say that? The urn that was stolen is a pretty important object... Andrews: Maybe, but it's actual value after appraisal was... well, practically zero. Maya: Zero!? Andrews: I polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it look more valuable! Maya: B-But that urn contains the soul of Mystic Ami... Andrews: Anyway, I left all the security arrangements to Detective Atmey. But... Five days ago, I began receiving all sorts of other exhibit items from Kurain. Lots of people started going in and out of the warehouse down there. Maya: So maybe one of them was actually Mask\u2606DeMasque in disguise...! Andrews: No, I personally checked out everyone that came through here, so that's not possible. Phoenix: (Knowing Adrian, she probably even checked out what they ate for breakfast that morning.) Present Anything Phoenix: Umm... Ms. Andrews? Andrews: I know, I know! It's all my fault! But what's done is done... I'll make it up by making a new urn for you... Phoenix: (I'm just wasting my time. She's too far gone...) Basement Warehouse Examine Security camera Phoenix: I wonder if that detective brought this camera in with him? Maya: Good question! Let's take a look at it. ...Huh? It says \"Property of Lordly Tailor\" on it. Phoenix: So it's borrowed...? Maya: Kind of strange for an \"Ace Detective\", don't you think? Computer Phoenix: According to the computer data... ...someone did in fact go through those big doors last night, right? Maya: Yeah, I guess so. The shutter did go off once, you know. Wooden box Phoenix: That pathetic-looking wooden box... Maya: Ahh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it! Phoenix: Don't touch it! There may be clues to the thief's identity on there! Maya: Grr... I worked so hard to make that box! Phoenix: Huh!? You MADE that poor excuse for a box, Maya? Maya: What's that supposed to mean!? And I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle* Phoenix: (Poor Maya. Maybe it'd have been better if Mask\u2606DeMasque had taken the box, too...) Shichishito Maya: I'm really starting to like this thing. It's so cool-looking. I'd like to strap it to my waist and walk around town like a samurai. Phoenix: Careful. Gumshoe will lock you up and throw away the key if you're caught. Door to the storeroom Maya: Our precious urn was right there on the other side of these doors. Phoenix: Yeah. and according to the security computer data... Maya: Someone was in there last night. Grrr... What I'd like to do to him...! Spilled paint Phoenix: It looks to me like it's been dry for several days. Maya: There's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink. Phoenix: ...I don't see how the color of the paint is in any way important. Ami Fey statue Phoenix: When we were here with Ms. Andrews last night, the statue wasn't there it is now. Maya: Yeah, it was right next to the door, wasn't it? Phoenix: Well, if someone moved it, it was probably the criminal. Maya: Maybe he didn't like being watched by Mystic Ami while he stole the urn. Phoenix: ...Hey! Cut it out! You're giving me the creeps with that kind of talk! After clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices and clearing \"The security\" Talk option in Lordly Tailor - Main Exhibition Hall: October 12Atmey Detective Agency Maya: Hello? ...Well, well. How lovely it is to see you again, my dear. Atmey: Welcome to my abode! Relax! and soak up the atmosphere... Phoenix: Err, umm... We're actually kind of... Atmey: SHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Precisely as I expected. Maya: Wh-What is? Atmey: ...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. ...Am I correct? Maya: ...Umm. I think we've already been through this. Atmey: Ha! So my estimation was correct! Zvarri! ...How truly elegant. Now then, what can I do for you? Examine Gramophone Maya: Aaah! So the music in this room is coming from here! Atmey: \"Luke Atmey Elegy\" composed by Luke Atmey. This lovely device is called a \"gramophone\". In days of yore, people listened to music on them. Maya: Aha! That's just what I thought! I told you so, Nick! Phoenix: ... Luke Atmey painting Maya: That's quite a large portrait of yourself you have there... Atmey: Yes. I wanted it to say to everyone who saw it, \"Look at me, Luke Atmey!\" With a model so fine, I knew the portrait would also be aesthetically pleasing! Maya: ...Um, that's nice. Fireplace Maya: Aaah! There's a cold breeze coming from this hearth! Atmey: Hee hee hee hee... It seems you've fallen for my little deception. You see, this fireplace conceals a rather unexpected device. ...Yes! A high-tech air conditioner! Maya: Wh-Why would you put an air conditioner in there? Atmey: In the summer it acts as an air conditioner and in the winter, it's a heater. Clever? Talk The night of the crime Phoenix: You mentioned before that you were on guard all alone last night. Atmey: Precisely. This is my fifth encounter with my arch-enemy. I refuse to allow anyone to interfere with the rightful pursuit of my prey. Maya: I heard you've been after Mask\u2606DeMasque since his very first theft? Atmey: Yes, my dear. I see you've done your homework. In his very first heist, that vile thief pilfered the famous jewel, the \"Tear of Emanon\"! I first encountered him in the museum's sacred hall. The crime scene itself! Maya: So... that's why you were hired as security for the Treasure Exhibit? Phoenix: (I'm pretty sure he said that Adrian Andrews hired him...) Atmey: Yes, I borrowed some equipment from Lordly Tailor and set the perfect trap. Phoenix: You must mean the security camera... Maya: But I thought you were watching the area yourself, too. So how did Mask\u2606DeMasque manage to steal the urn? Phoenix: That's the million dollar question... What is DeMasque's modus operandi? Sacred Urn Maya: Umm... Mr. Atmey? Did you know about the Sacred Urn? Atmey: I'm interested in only one thing my dear, and that is Mask\u2606DeMasque! Sacred Urn...? Pfft! That has nothing to do with this case. Phoenix: But... wasn't that what Mask\u2606DeMasque stole this time? Atmey: I am a hunter, sir! That urn was nothing more than a lure to catch my prey. Do you yourselves remember the shape of the individual peanuts you throw to pigeons? Maya: ...I don't think I like this guy's attitude, Nick. Phoenix: Well anyway, it looks like he doesn't know about the urn. DeMasque's M.O. (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Maya: Umm... There's something that's kind of bothering me. Atmey: Please, my dear, ask me anything you like. After all, we are all but seekers, wandering alone in the dark. Maya: Well, I was wondering how Mask\u2606DeMasque managed to steal the urn. I mean, isn't it strange that you don't seem to know? Atmey: ... Phoenix: Yeah, now that you mention it, it is strange. After all, you were on guard that night at the scene of the crime. Unless you were sound asleep, you should have at least seen Mask\u2606DeMasque. Atmey: ... 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: Wh-What the!? It's a Psyche-Lock... Maya: Ps-Psyche Lock...? DeMasque's M.O. (subsequent times) Phoenix: Mr. Atmey... You must know more than you're letting on. How did Mask\u2606DeMasque manage to steal the Sacred Urn...? 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Atmey: In order for a secret to remain a secret, it must be kept secret. Phoenix: (Last night Luke Atmey must have encountered Mask\u2606DeMasque... But why would he be trying to hide it...?) Maya: Nick! Go for it! Let's break that Psyche-Lock of his! Phoenix: (...I don't really think she understands what she's talking about. Well, it's been a while, but let's give this a shot...) Psyche-Lock (appears after \"DeMasque's M.O.\", before breaking Psyche-Lock) Maya: Hey, Nick, what is this Psyche-Lock thing? Phoenix: Well, your magatama lets me see when people are keeping secrets. By breaking their mental \"locks\", I can find out what those secrets are. Maya: Whaaaaat!? This Magatama has THAT kind of power!? Phoenix: ... Maya, you're the one who gave me this Magatama last year... Maya: ...Well, it's true that this Magatama is a prized Fey family heirloom, but... Pearly was the one that actually imbued it with spiritual powers, right? That's why I don't really know much about what it can do. Phoenix: (This is the woman that's going to take over the Kurain Channeling School someday!?) Maya: So how do you do it? How do you break the Psyche-Lock thing? Phoenix: ...Well, you present the Magatama to the person with the secret. Maya: ...Cool! I can't wait to see it in action! Come on! Try it out! Phoenix: (Oh boy... I think the future Master still needs to learn how to be patient...) DeMasque's M.O. (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Atmey: I can't deny that there may be a small hint of \"truth\" in what you say. Maya: So, you were knocked out when the thief first clobbered you? Atmey: Clobber... What an ugly way of saying it. But I suppose you could put it that way. The coward struck at the precise moment that I turned to look at the computer. Maya: So you never noticed that the thief had entered the warehouse? Atmey: No, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Perhaps the air ducts or the sewer pipes... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here! Maya: Ouch. Mr. Atmey should have his poor head examined. (Changed from [Ouch. He should have his poor head examined.] in the original release) Phoenix: You can say that again. How could he have underestimated the thief that badly? Shichishito updated in the Court Record. DeMasque's M.O. (subsequent times) Atmey: I can't deny that there may be a small hint of \"truth\" in what you say. Maya: So, you were knocked out when the thief first clobbered you? Atmey: Clobber... What an ugly way of saying it. But I suppose you could put it that way. The coward struck at the precise moment that I turned to look at the computer.

(Changed from [Ouch. He should have his poor head examined.] in the original release) Phoenix: You can say that again. How could he have underestimated the thief that badly? Present Magatama (after clearing \"DeMasque's M.O.\" Talk option) Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- Mask\u2606DeMasque's M. O.  -- Phoenix: Detective Atmey, you were standing guard at the scene of the crime... There's no way you didn't see Mask\u2606DeMasque commit the crime. Atmey: Well now, I can hardly see why you're so positive about that. Yes, indeed I was guarding the warehouse. That much is true. But I can tell you for certain that not a single person passed through that door. Phoenix: (I'm not sure why... But this Atmey guy is lying through his teeth. ...I know. I'll show him some proof!) Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night! Present Camera Data Phoenix: Leads to: \"There was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Atmey: How very interesting that you would present such a thing to me, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective. Unfortunately... It is meaningless. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer. Phoenix: (I guess that's a miss...) Atmey: Well then...? Is there something else I can do for you? Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe I don't have enough evidence yet. If that's true, it could be dangerous for me to push on. But I need to break him!) Leads back to: \"Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night!\" Phoenix: There was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime. It should have automatically taken a photo of anyone that went through that door. Atmey: ...Precisely. Phoenix: I hope you don't mind, but we've already gotten our hands on the camera data. As you can see, the camera went off exactly once last night. Atmey: Wha...! B-But my monocle didn't catch anyone in its flash! It must be some kind of computer malfunction... It-It must be...! Phoenix: Maybe it was your monocle that malfunctioned. Atmey: Wh-What!? Are you saying that I didn't do my duty properly? Phoenix: Detective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night. The question is why are you trying to hide it! (If he's hiding it, there must be some reason! Some reason that he desperately wants to keep hidden... And I've got just the piece of evidence that should prove it!) OK, let's suppose you didn't manage to see Mask\u2606DeMasque. In that case, the reason you didn't at that time was because you were... fast asleep. Atmey: ...I'm afraid that making a guess is not enough. Time to put your money where your mouth is. Show me your evidence! Present anything Phoenix: Atmey: ...May I give you a piece of good advice, Sir Lawyer? Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Atmey: ...A guess is not the same as a theory. Not scientifically, anyway. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer. Phoenix: (Argh! I guess I need to think this over again!) Leads back to: \"Detective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night.\" using the bathroom. Atmey: ...I'm afraid that making a guess is not enough. Time to put your money where your mouth is. Show me your evidence! Present anything Phoenix: Atmey: ...May I give you a piece of good advice, Sir Lawyer? Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Atmey: ...A guess is not the same as a theory.

Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Atmey: ...A guess is not the same as a theory. Not scientifically, anyway. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer. Phoenix: (Argh! I guess I need to think this over again!) Leads back to: \"Detective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night.\" Phoenix: Detective Atmey... You were knocked unconscious by the thief, weren't you!? Atmey: Ha ha ha! Surely you must be joking... You think that I, Luke Atmey, could be knocked unconscious so easily!? Phoenix: This sword proves it! Atmey: ...! Th-That's... Phoenix: Before the theft, this sword was in the hand of the statue of Ami Fey. Furthermore... at that time, it was not bent. Atmey: Aaah... Err... Phoenix: ...There's only one explanation. You were struck on the head and knocked unconscious by this sword! Well, Detective!? How about it!? (Changed from [Well, Detective!? What about it!?] in the original release) Atmey: ...I'm impressed. You truly are an \"Ace Attorney\"... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Ron DeLite profile Atmey: This man surrendered to the police, admitting that he was Mask\u2606DeMasque. Phoenix: Maybe so... But I'm not convinced that he's really behind the thefts. Atmey: He is. Maya: ...He sounds pretty sure. Atmey: Just look at his forehead. It's all in the shape of his mouth and eyes... This is the classic face of a thief. It is unmistakable! Maya: Is there anything that isn't \"unmistakable\" to you... Any other profile Phoenix: What about this person here, Detective Atmey? Atmey: ... Maya: Is something wrong? Did the cat get your tongue or something? Atmey: That photo leaves me with a distinctly indistinct feeling. Phoenix: Ummm... Atmey: In this case, I'm afraid my perspicacity has been left wanting. Phoenix: (I think he's trying to say that he doesn't have any information...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Well it looks like we got one thing cleared up anyway. Maya: Huh? What? That Atmey is the greatest Ace Detective in the world? Phoenix: No, that he never actually saw the thief. Maya: Oh... that's right! So the thief may not even be Mask\u2606DeMasque... Atmey: Just one moment, Sir Lawyer! The thief was unquestionably Mask\u2606DeMasque! Maya: But you never actually saw him! Atmey: Perhaps so, but I installed a security camera for just such a contingency. Maya: Oh... Atmey: Last night, the camera went off exactly once. Behold! This is a photo of the dastardly thief, taken by the security camera! Phoenix: ...Th-That's him! Maya: M-Mask\u2606DeMasque...! Security Camera Photo added to the Court Record. Atmey: The thief can be none other than the arch-criminal, Mask\u2606DeMasque. After all, he has a very good reason for committing such brazen crimes. Phoenix: Wh-What are you talking about? Talk DeMasque's reason Phoenix: So... What did you mean by he had a \"very good reason\"? Atmey: Exactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate. Maya: B-But how would you know about that...? Atmey: Hmph. Have you forgotten? You're speaking to the finest Ace Detective ever to walk on the face of the earth! The most brilliant mind since ...well, EVER! Luke Atmey! Phoenix: (*sigh* Well, I guess we'd better go take a look, just in case...) DeMasque's Hideout (after clearing \"DeMasque's reason\" Talk option in Atmey Detective Agency) Examine Green envelope Leads to: \"Hey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?\" Maya: Hey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!? Atmey: Exactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate. Phoenix: A green envelope, huh... Looks like this is it. Maya: OK! Let's have a look! \"If you don't want your true identity revealed to the world... ...come to KB Security at 1:00 AM on October 12th and bring $50,000.\" F-F-F-Fifty thousand...! Phoenix: Th-Th... This is a... B-B-Blackmail letter... (It sure looks like a major clue alright!) Blackmail Letter added to the Court Record. ...*ding-dong*... Desir\u00e9e: Oh! Someone's at the door! I'll be right back. Won't take but a second, I promise. (Oh, thank you for coming! That's so nice of you!) ???: (When I see a damsel in distress, I just can't help myself!) Desir\u00e9e: (Please, come on in! I'll make some coffee.) ???: (Really? OK, I guess I'll make myself at home, pretty lady!) Phoenix: (...Wait a minute. I know that voice...) Desir\u00e9e: Oh, Nicky boy, I'm so sorry, but I've got another guest! ???: Aaaaaaaaaaaah!! You... You're... Nick, it's you! And Maya, too! What a fluke! Maya: Ah...! Larry! Long time no see! Desir\u00e9e: What? You know each other? Butz: Ni... \"Nicky boy\"!? Nick, do you and this girl have... you know... something going on? Phoenix: \"S-Something\"? If you mean what I thin-- Butz: I underestimated you, Nick! A gorgeous lady like this? ...And married, too? Way to go, dude! Phoenix: (I knew it. Just when things can't get any worse, it's time to cue in the Butz.) Larry Butz... Ever since grade school, he's been... Not exactly a close friend, but yeah, we know each other. Butz: Hey, man, that wasn't nice! I was your very first client! Phoenix: We've got quite the... storied history, he and I. (Changed from [It's been 25 years since I first met Larry.] in the original release) And what we used to say still rings true. When something smells, it's usually the Butz. Butz: Hey, come on now! You're embarrassing me! And in front of this pretty little thing here... Desir\u00e9e: So you two are old childhood friends, I see. That's so sweet! You two go ahead and catch up on old times. I'm going to go check on my bike. Butz: Nice girl, that Dessie... So how have ya been, Nick? Phoenix: (Too busy if you really want to know...) Examine Green envelope Phoenix: So Ron received a blackmail letter, huh? Maya: Do you think Ms. DeLite knows about this? Phoenix: Well if she did, I don't think she would've been smiling like that. Maya: I wonder if we should tell her about it... Phoenix: I think it'd be smarter if we didn't. Talk Larry Butz Phoenix: So what have you been up to this whole time? It's been two years since I heard from you. And what's with these clothes? You look... well, weird. Butz: Hey man, that's uncalled for. This is my uniform, from a my part-time job! But I can't believe it's been two years. They say time flies when you're having fun. Ha ha ha ha... Ah ha... Ha... ...ha? Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong? Butz: Nick... I gotta tell you. Women. ...I don't trust'em anymore. Phoenix: You got dumped again? Butz: Well, you know Bennifer? I followed her all the way to Tibet 2 years ago. That's where I met the famous Katty Tom, and my whole life changed. Phoenix: \"Bennifer\"? \"Katty Tom\"? I never heard of either of them. Butz: Anyway... Dude! Katty Tom chose Hollywood over me! Can you believe it? Maya: Well, actually... Anyway sounds like you had quite the adventure. Butz: Women! They're so... so... Aaaah! Oh... B-But you're different, Maya. You're not like the rest. Phoenix: (...Looks like he's still the same old Larry.) Why are you here? (Changed from [Why you came here] in the original release) Phoenix: So what are you doing here anyway? Butz: Huh...? What do you mean by that? I'm just a natural-born nice guy, that's all. Well, actually... I picked this up last night while I was working. Phoenix: ...A wallet? You say you found this last night? Butz: Yeah, it had a driver's license in it, so I figured I'd just return it myself. Ron's Wallet added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Hang on... Let me see that for a minute. ... I know it. Dessie's picture is in here. Butz: Yeah, I guess he really digs his wife, huh? ... Hey, Nick... It's not what you're thinking at all! Phoenix: No, I'm pretty sure it is. You haven't changed a bit. Butz: Aw, no way man! I mean, she's a married woman! That's just bad news! Phoenix: (He really IS here just to check out Ms. DeLite...) Maya: So you said you found it at your job, right? Butz: Yeah! I'm working for a private security company as a guard! Chicks just love a guy in uniform, you know! Phoenix: (A security guard, huh. So that's what that uniform is all about...) Why are you here? (Changed from [Why you came here] in the original release) (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what are you doing here anyway? Butz: Huh...? What do you mean by that? I'm just a natural-born nice guy, that's all. Well, actually... I picked this up last night while I was working. Phoenix: ...A wallet? You say you found this last night? Butz: Yeah, it had a driver's license in it, so I figured I'd just return it myself. Wallet (appears after \"Why are you here?\") Phoenix: So what time was it when you found this last night? Butz: Huh? Why are you asking that!? Trying to see if I've got an \"alibi\"!? Phoenix: (Umm... You're not the one on the hook for a crime this time, buddy.) Butz: I guess it was around 1:00 in the morning on the first floor of our company building. Phoenix: (What was Mr. DeLite's wallet doing there...?) Butz: ...Anyway, there's nothing weird about that. After all, he works there. Maya: He... works there? You mean... Mr. DeLite? Butz: Sure. Here, take a look at this. It's right there in his wallet. Maya: What's this card? Butz: It's a key card for the security company. See! It's got a serial number on it right there. There's no mistake about it. (Changed form [Hey! It's got a serial number on it right there. There's no mistake about it.] in the original release) Phoenix: You said you were working part-time at a \"security company\", right? Butz: That's right. ...Wh-Why are you making that scary face? Phoenix: (\"Security company\", huh... Something's not quite secure about Larry working there... I need to find out as much as I can about this key card...) Key Card added to the Court Record. Wallet (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what time was it when you found this last night? Butz: Huh? Why are you asking that!? Trying to see if I've got an \"alibi\"!? Phoenix: (Umm... You're not the one on the hook for a crime this time, buddy.) Butz: I guess it was around 1:00 in the morning on the first floor of our company building.

Phoenix: (\"Security company\", huh... Something's not quite secure about Larry working there... I need to find out as much as I can about this key card...) Key Card added to the Court Record. KB Security (appears after presenting Blackmail Letter) Phoenix: KB Security, the company in the blackmail letter! You know about it!? Butz: That's where I work, yeah. In fact, I'm on the job right now. Maya: Huh...? So what are you doing here then? Butz: Well, the boss is away right now, and you know what mice do when the cat's away... Phoenix: ...Yes, yes. *sigh* Anyway, how far away is this company? Butz: Lemme see... About 30 minutes by car, I guess... Well, if you fly down the road, anyway. Phoenix: Hmm. Well, this apartment building is pretty close to Lordly Tailor, right? Maya: And it would take roughly an hour to go from here to KB Security and back. Phoenix: If Ron DeLite was at KB Security when the robbery occurred, then... Maya: Whoa...! Then he couldn't have stolen Sacred Urn! Present Treasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue, Sacred Urn, or Shichishito Phoenix: Larry, this is one of the treasures from Kurain Village... Butz: Be serious, Nick! I couldn't care less about mystic mumbo jumbo stuff! Maya: ... Butz: Ah! Of course Maya is a different story! Phoenix: (Talk about your mixed messages...) Blackmail Letter Phoenix: Hey Larry, what about this? Butz: What? If you've got something to say, then say it already! ... Huh...? A blackmail letter!? Phoenix: Do you know anything about this? Butz: Wh-Wha-What? I don't know anything about Alexis! And that's the truth! Phoenix: ... Huh? What? Butz: I-I can't believe you'd do this to me! I thought you were my friend! Fifty thousand dollars! I don't have that kind of money! Phoenix: No, no, you don't understand! This blackmail letter was sent to Ron DeLite! Butz: Wheeeew! Man, you scared me!! I almost had a heart attack, you idiot! Phoenix: Wait, I'm the idiot!? Butz: Man, I was totally confused because it says, \"KB Security\" right on the envelope. Maya: Um, yeah... So what? Butz: That's where I've got a part-time job! At KB Security! Maya: Wh... Whaaaat! Phoenix: (Sounds like I should really find out some more about this KB Security company!) Ron's Wallet Phoenix: You didn't touch anything in the wallet, did you? Butz: Hey man, be serious! You know what I was interested in! Phoenix: (If Mask\u2606DeMasque doesn't look out, he's gonna be the victim of a robbery himself!) Key Card Phoenix: So you're sure about this key card? Butz: Yup. That's the key card we use at the building I work in. (Changed from [Yup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in.] in the original release) According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a record. Maya: It leaves a record? Butz: Yeah, it tells you exactly who entered the room and when. Phoenix: Larry! I need that data...! Butz: Whoa! Slow down, man! Sorry, but that data is off limits to outsiders. If I lost this job, I'd never have a chance with Dessie... Phoenix: (It's times like these when I wish lawyers weren't so powerless...) Key Card updated in the Court Record. Key Card (subsequent times) Phoenix: So you're sure about this key card? Butz: Yup.

Phoenix: (It's times like these when I wish lawyers weren't so powerless...) Phoenix Wright profile Butz: You're 26 years old, right? Don't you think it's about time you took a long, hard look at your life? Phoenix: ... Coming from a guy who can only brag about how many times he's been rejected... I find that kind of... ironic. Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You've even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look totally different than two years ago. Don't you think Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh! What a cutie! Hey, Nick! So what's the deal between you and this girl? Maya: Hey! That's my cousin! Her name is Pearl Fey. Butz: Pearl, huh... Too bad. Never date two girls with the same name... That's one rule I can't break. Phoenix: (...I'd think the fact that she's only 9 years old would break some rule somewhere!) Adrian Andrews profile Butz: WHOA! WHO is this! Come on, man, don't hold out on me! Phoenix: Forget about it. It's on a need to know basis and you don't need to kn-- Butz: Hey now! I thought we were pals! I got a MAJOR thing for girls with black sleeveless shirts and glasses! Phoenix: How do you know that!? Butz: And if they have an orange-colored memo pad, I really lose my cool! Phoenix: (He has to be making that up... He can't really know Adrian... Can he...?) Mask\u2606DeMasque profile Butz: I just thought of something! What if it's actually a hot chick under that costume! Phoenix: Forget about it. It's a guy, trust me. Butz: Man! You're killin' my buzz, dude! Maya: Boy, talk about someone who has a one track mind... Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile Butz: That Dessie is one awesome lady alright! It's been a long time since I've felt this way... I think I'm really in love this time! Maya: A long time, huh? Butz: Yeah! Well, err... Except for what I feel for you, Maya! Phoenix: (I don't think even HE knows what he's saying anymore.) Larry Butz profile Butz: Even you could learn a few tricks from me, Nick! Phoenix: ...Yeah? Like what? Butz: Look at my hair for example. It points up straight, right? But your hair, on the other hand, points backwards. That's no good at all, man! It's defeatist! You gotta aim high... for the stars! Phoenix: (I... I can't find a counter-argument to that...) Any other evidence Phoenix: ...What about this? Does anything come to mind? Butz: Listen, I'm a security guard. I'm not here to sell you juicy bits of info and chew the fat, man. Phoenix: (Funny, you had no qualms about selling Samurai Dogs just 2 years ago.) Any other profile Phoenix: Larry, what about this person...? Butz: Beats me. Phoenix: (What the...? All of a sudden, he's got nothing to say...?) After clearing \"Wallet\" and \"KB Security\" Talk options and presenting Key Card: Phone: ... Maya: Hey, Nick! Your phone! (Changed from [Oh, Nick! Your phone!] in the original release) Phone: ...*beep*... Pearl: H-Hello? Is this the Wright residence? Phoenix: Ah! Pearls! Where are you!? Pearl: I-I thought I'd go to Lordly Tailor to try to find some more clues, but... ...I'm afraid I've gotten lost. Maya: Whaaaat!? Give me that phone, Nick! P-Pearly! Where are you right now!? Pearl: Um... I was walking along and I found myself in front of that person's office. Maya: \"That person\"...? Who!? Pearl: Um, the person who doesn't act his age and always says, \"Zvarri!\" when he's excited... Phoenix: (Luke Atmey, Ace Detective...) OK, stay right there! We're coming to get you! Pearl: A-Alright... I-I'm a little scared... Phone: ...*beep*... Phoenix: Alright! Let's go, Maya! Butz: Wait a second, Nick! Phoenix: Wh-What? Butz: That phone call just now... Sounded like real cutie... Another one of your, ahem, ...\"special friends\"? Phoenix: .......... Say goodbye to Ms. DeLite for me, would you Larry? October 12Atmey Detective Agency Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya! Maya: Pearly! Pearl: I never thought I'd see the two of you again! Phoenix: ...So is Mr. Ace Detective out of the office? Pearl: Yes, when I arrived here... ...there wasn't a single soul in sight. Maya: Say, Nick... Doesn't look like something's changed since we were here last? Phoenix: (Now that you mention it...) Examine Bag Leads to: \"This bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before.\" Maya: This bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before. Pearl: It looks quite full... I wonder what could be in here? Maya: Hey, Nick! Come on! Open it up! Phoenix: Hey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property! Maya: Don't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Phoenix: (That's true... And truth be told, I have to admit I am kind of curious...) Maya: Well? What's in there? Phoenix: H-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...) Atmey: ...Well, hello there!! Maya: EEEEEEK! H-He's here! Atmey: ...What are you doing, Sir Lawyer? I'm shocked to see a servant of the court ignoring the law so flagrantly! Phoenix: I-I'm really sorry! M-Maya made me do it! Maya: Nick! I can't believe you! Atmey: A gentlemen never uses a lady as an excuse for his own poor behavior... The real question is... Can you afford to waste time lollygagging about here? Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean by that? Atmey: Perhaps I should make myself more clear? Tomorrow's trial... Zvarri! Shall we say the figurative Sir William will be dropping his panties before lunchtime? Maya: Wow, Nick! Sounds like it's gonna be really exciting. Examine Bag Maya: So what's in there, Nick? What's in the bag? Phoenix: The way Atmey barged in like that, I never actually got the chance to look! Pearl: I know. I thought I was going to collapse of shock, too! Phoenix: (But from the feel of it, it was something hard...) Talk Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: Umm... What's going to happen at the trial tomorrow that's so dramatic? Atmey: Do you know what your biggest mistake so far has been, Sir Lawyer? ...It was becoming a lawyer in the first place. Pearl: ...That certainly does sound like a big mistake, Mr. Nick. Atmey: Tomorrow will be a day to remember. I, Luke Atmey, will take the stand! And then... Zvarri! My testimony will prove to be the undoing of the lot of you! Yes! All of you! I will unmask you as the thief's co-conspirators! Maya: C-C-Conspirators!? Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... You're quick on the defensive, I see! However! It is not I that is your greatest enemy! There is a far more dangerous threat that you will face during the trial. Maya: Wh-What are you talking about...? Atmey: Sir Lawyer... If you truly are who you say, I'm sure you've heard of him. ...His name is \"Godot\". Phoenix: G-Godot...? DeMasque's identity Atmey: You have taken a step down the path of foolishness. To try to defend a career criminal who deserves nothing less than the death penalt-- Maya: Hey! Last time I checked, no one knows for sure that Mr. DeLite really is DeMasque! Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... My dear lady... Times may change, but people, sadly, do not... ...Well. You will understand this when you are more mature. Godot (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\") Maya: Um... Who is this \"Godot\" person...? Atmey: ...It's not surprising that a spirit medium has not heard the name. Godot. The prosecutor whose equal cannot be found in this country, but in heaven. Godot. A legend or myth... Men pin a lifetime of hopes on the chance to simply meet him. Pearl: Prosecutor Godot... (Changed from [Prosecutor...] in the original release) Maya: But the best prosecutor in the country isn't Godot, it's Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right, Nick!? Atmey: ...It's no surprise that a spirit medium such as yourself would know nothing of this. But Ace Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth is currently traveling abroad. Maya: Huh...? Atmey: In fact, it was Mr. Edgeworth who acknowledged Godot as the best in this country. Pearl: And you agree with that? Atmey: Most certainly. In fact, you could call him the Luke Atmey of the Prosecutor's Office. Maya: Well, that's good to hear! The prosecution has a fighting chance tomorrow! Pearl: Mr. Nick, is this \"Godot\" really that strong? Phoenix: Hmm... I seem to remember hearing about something like that... Atmey: Not surprising... Some people spend their entire lives idly waiting for his appearance. Present Anything Maya: Ummm, Mr. Atmey...? Could you take a look at this? Atmey: Oh please. You can drop the pretense already. Maya: Huh...? Atmey: You and I are already fated to fight each other... And the only true weapon for warriors in a court of law is information! Surely you don't expect me to sharpen your sword for you! Maya: ...Creep. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: (It looks like we're done investigating for the day.) Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... Sir Lawyer... The stage has been set and all the pieces are finally in place. All that remains now... is for the dance to begin! Phoenix: (A new prosecutor, an Ace Detective and a thief... This will be one tough trial.) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\nThe Stolen Turnabout TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4October 13, 9:36 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4Maya: Hey, Nick!Phoenix: What is it?

I bought this Mask\u2606DeMasque publicity photo!] in the original release)Phoenix: You bought this... where? (Changed from [You bought that...?

He's at it again.Ron: I sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor! I admit iiiit!!Phoenix: But... You don't have the Sacred Urn, right?Ron: Well, that's true, but... That doesn't mean that I didn't commit the crime.Phoenix: (Normally, when I say \"Of course you didn't\" I'm being sarcastic, but you... Yikes!)Ron: Anyway, I admit that I'm guilty... So make sure they give me a guilty verdict! Pleeeeease!?Desir\u00e9e: Oh, there you are Ronnie! Bonjour, sweetie!Ron: Oh! D-Dessie honey! B-Bonjour! ...Well, actually...

I'm counting on you, Nicky boy! Good luck!Phoenix: (To be honest, I really don't know whether Ron is Mask\u2606DeMasque or not. But there's only one thing I AM sure of. He doesn't have the Sacred Urn right now...)Bailiff: Mr. DeLite!

Are you prepared to...???: ...What a stupid question!Judge: Wh-What did you say!???: Fine. Let me ask you then, Your Honor. Are YOU ready? Are you ready to pass judgement?Judge: Wh...! N-No, I... I'm not! I will pass judgement after I hear arguments from both sides.???: Well, if you're not ready yourself, you shouldn't expect others to be. That's a rule to live by.Judge: ...Um, wh-who are you?Godot: I am Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.Maya: Ah! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...Judge: Yes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?Godot: Ha...! None.Judge: What did you say...?Godot: I've never prosecuted a case before.Judge: N-Never? But you said you've never lost before.Godot: ...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.Judge: Quite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?Godot: Even the mightiest of redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.Judge: Yes, but... A mask? In a court of law?Godot: Ha...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.Judge: ...!Maya: This guy is the real deal alright, Nick...Phoenix: (Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the \"real deal\"...?)Godot: So we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!Phoenix: ...?Maya: N-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?Phoenix: No. I don't have any friends that call me \"Trite\".

Your Honor.Judge: In any case, please give your opening statement.Godot: Opening statement? Those things are not fit for even dogs to consume. I have only one thing to say before we start. To you... Mr. Trite.Phoenix: Wh-What is it?Godot: Are you familiar with the saying, \"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link\"? I wonder... how much you can withstand before you and your case break in two...?Phoenix: ...Judge: Hmm... Well then, let's hear from the first witness!Gumshoe: Um, my name is...Godot: No one asked for your name, witness.Gumshoe: ...Urk.Godot: The important thing is what you know... That's all. Start talking. ...We're listening.Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir.Judge: Alright, witness. First, let's hear about... What you know about the thief that stole the urn.Gumshoe: Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Crimes --Gumshoe: Mask\u2606DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago. He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime! This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor. His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces. That's why we're sure it was Mask\u2606DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!Judge: Hmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask\u2606DeMasque is... M-Mr. Godot! W-What are you--!? (Changed from [M-Mr. Godot! Y-You!] in the original release) W-We're in the middle of a trial here, Mr. Godot!Godot: Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee. I'm sure you can grant me at least this much... Your Honor. Oh, please. Proceed.Judge: ... Very well. It's only coffee, after all.Phoenix: (What!? You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)Judge: Proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Maya: Well, Nick? What are you going to do?Phoenix: As long as they haven't brought up Mr. DeLite's identity... ...all we can do is show that it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque who stole the urn.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Crimes --Gumshoe: Mask\u2606DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Have you been involved in the investigation from the beginning? Gumshoe: Yup! Nobody knows more about the thief than me, pal! It's true! I'm a... Zvarri...! \"Author on thieves\"! Phoenix: ... Maya: An \"author\"...? He's written books about thieves? Phoenix: Um, I think he probably meant to say \"authority\". Gumshoe: The fact that this guy can slip through even my fingers shows how good he is, pal! Phoenix: (It's easy when those fingers happen to be \"butter fingers\"...) Press harder Phoenix: So nobody knows more about the thief than you, huh...? Gumshoe: You got it, pal! Except maybe for the thief's mom, that is! Phoenix: But isn't there someone who knows even more about him than the police? Gumshoe: You don't mean... \"Detective Zvarri\", do you? Judge: Hmm... Who is this person? Zvarri? He sounds German... Gumshoe: His name is Luke Atmey, sir. I guess I shouldn't have made up such a silly name for him. Phoenix: (What the heck? I guess he's not all that famous after all...) Gumshoe: Anyway, it's true that he did manage to retrieve the last item the thief stole. Judge: ...Oh, I see. It seems you're not the expert you claim to be. Gumshoe: ...Urk! I-It looks like the thief is playing with me, even now! Leads back to cross-examination Leave it Phoenix: (The real \"authority\" on the thief is the other detective. I don't need to ask this one any more questions...) Leads back to cross-examinationGumshoe: He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Have you seen all of these so-called \"calling cards\"? Gumshoe: Of course I have. Except... The person in charge of the Treasure Exhibit never brought their card to the police... So I didn't see this one until after the crime occurred. Maya: That's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police. Judge: Was the calling card that Lordly Tailor received authentic? Gumshoe: Well, all the cards have one common, identifying feature. But we're not releasing that information to the general public... Judge: But you're absolutely certain that this card is real? Phoenix: (Gumshoe can't say it out loud but I bet he's talking about Mask\u2606DeMasque's emblem...)Gumshoe: This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: His fifth heist... And your fifth screw up, huh? Gumshoe: Objection, pal! That ain't fair! Maybe you could say I screwed up four times! But this last time wasn't my fault! I didn't know about the calling card this time! Phoenix: (You of all people shouldn't be chuckling about this, Detective Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: I just want everyone here in the courtroom to know something! If you ever get a calling card from this guy, don't call some stupid private eye! Call your local police right away. Got me? Maya: Wow, it looks like he's really got it in for Detective Atmey.Gumshoe: His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Art pieces? Like what, for example? Gumshoe: Well, his first target was the famous \"Tear of Emanon\". Judge: What's that? Some kind of especially salty teardrop? Gumshoe: N-No, sir. It's a blue diamond. A single, rare diamond. Next was the \"Crown of Bongora\"... You know, the thing you put on your head. After that was the \"Left Hand of Hades\" and then the \"Portrait of Mejeena\", sir. Detective Atmey retrieved the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" and returned it to the museum. Phoenix: And the target of his fifth and last robbery was the \"Sacred Urn\"... right? Judge: But isn't it difficult for him to dispose of such famous art pieces...? Gumshoe: Well, we assume he must have some underworld connections. Maya: Somehow, Mr. DeLite doesn't look the type... Phoenix: (Yeah, he's a little too sunny to be hanging out in the underworld...)Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"Gumshoe: That's why we're sure it was Mask\u2606DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean when you say, \"it fits his M. O. to a T\"? Judge: I was thinking of asking the same thing myself. Gumshoe: Ugh... I wish you would listen a little more closely, pal. First of all, there's the calling card. We're 100% certain it's authentic. Then there's the fact that he seemed to know all about the security system. And finally, his target was an art piece. These are all part of the thief's modus operandi. Judge: And so, since this robbery seems to fit all those conditions...? Gumshoe: That's right! It means that Mask\u2606DeMasque is behind it!Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"Maya: Nick! It definitely looks like it was Mask\u2606DeMasque who stole the urn!Phoenix: But there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask\u2606DeMasque.Maya: But... But...Phoenix: Also, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.Maya: So even though we know it was Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it...Phoenix: (Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Phoenix Wright\nDescription: Me.

The Sacred Urn is supposed to be one of these, but according to the evidence, the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) was appraised as having practically no monetary value. So if the thief only steals precious art, but the urn isn't valuable, that's a contradiction. Therefore, presenting the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) against Testimony 3 would show the contradiction."

Phoenix: So you hired him for security even before the calling card arrived? Andrews: Well, yes. I had a premonition that something bad might happen... I've learned to trust my hunches! Phoenix: So that's why there are security cameras, even in the basement warehouse? Andrews: Yes. Lordly Tailor is very serious about their security measures. It was their way of saying, \"Bring it on!\" to any potential thieves... Phoenix: (Well, he sure \"brought it\" last night... And even left with a nice souvenir.) The security Maya: Um, can you tell us a bit about the security for the Treasure Exhibit? Andrews: It was all my fault! I never should have called this paltry little collection a \"treasure exhibit\" anyway... Phoenix: Why do you say that? The urn that was stolen is a pretty important object... Andrews: Maybe, but it's actual value after appraisal was... well, practically zero. Maya: Zero!? Andrews: I polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it look more valuable! Maya: B-But that urn contains the soul of Mystic Ami... Andrews: Anyway, I left all the security arrangements to Detective Atmey. But... Five days ago, I began receiving all sorts of other exhibit items from Kurain. Lots of people started going in and out of the warehouse down there. Maya: So maybe one of them was actually Mask\u2606DeMasque in disguise...! Andrews: No, I personally checked out everyone that came through here, so that's not possible. Phoenix: (Knowing Adrian, she probably even checked out what they ate for breakfast that morning.) Present Anything Phoenix: Umm... Ms. Andrews? Andrews: I know, I know! It's all my fault! But what's done is done... I'll make it up by making a new urn for you... Phoenix: (I'm just wasting my time. She's too far gone...) Basement Warehouse Examine Security camera Phoenix: I wonder if that detective brought this camera in with him? Maya: Good question! Let's take a look at it. ...Huh? It says \"Property of Lordly Tailor\" on it. Phoenix: So it's borrowed...? Maya: Kind of strange for an \"Ace Detective\", don't you think? Computer Phoenix: According to the computer data... ...someone did in fact go through those big doors last night, right? Maya: Yeah, I guess so. The shutter did go off once, you know. Wooden box Phoenix: That pathetic-looking wooden box... Maya: Ahh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it! Phoenix: Don't touch it! There may be clues to the thief's identity on there! Maya: Grr... I worked so hard to make that box! Phoenix: Huh!? You MADE that poor excuse for a box, Maya? Maya: What's that supposed to mean!? And I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle* Phoenix: (Poor Maya. Maybe it'd have been better if Mask\u2606DeMasque had taken the box, too...) Shichishito Maya: I'm really starting to like this thing. It's so cool-looking. I'd like to strap it to my waist and walk around town like a samurai. Phoenix: Careful. Gumshoe will lock you up and throw away the key if you're caught. Door to the storeroom Maya: Our precious urn was right there on the other side of these doors. Phoenix: Yeah. and according to the security computer data... Maya: Someone was in there last night. Grrr... What I'd like to do to him...! Spilled paint Phoenix: It looks to me like it's been dry for several days. Maya: There's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink. Phoenix: ...I don't see how the color of the paint is in any way important. Ami Fey statue Phoenix: When we were here with Ms. Andrews last night, the statue wasn't there it is now. Maya: Yeah, it was right next to the door, wasn't it? Phoenix: Well, if someone moved it, it was probably the criminal. Maya: Maybe he didn't like being watched by Mystic Ami while he stole the urn. Phoenix: ...Hey! Cut it out! You're giving me the creeps with that kind of talk! After clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices and clearing \"The security\" Talk option in Lordly Tailor - Main Exhibition Hall: October 12Atmey Detective Agency Maya: Hello? ...Well, well. How lovely it is to see you again, my dear. Atmey: Welcome to my abode! Relax! and soak up the atmosphere... Phoenix: Err, umm... We're actually kind of... Atmey: SHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Precisely as I expected. Maya: Wh-What is? Atmey: ...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. ...Am I correct? Maya: ...Umm. I think we've already been through this. Atmey: Ha! So my estimation was correct! Zvarri! ...How truly elegant. Now then, what can I do for you? Examine Gramophone Maya: Aaah! So the music in this room is coming from here! Atmey: \"Luke Atmey Elegy\" composed by Luke Atmey. This lovely device is called a \"gramophone\". In days of yore, people listened to music on them. Maya: Aha! That's just what I thought! I told you so, Nick! Phoenix: ... Luke Atmey painting Maya: That's quite a large portrait of yourself you have there... Atmey: Yes. I wanted it to say to everyone who saw it, \"Look at me, Luke Atmey!\" With a model so fine, I knew the portrait would also be aesthetically pleasing! Maya: ...Um, that's nice. Fireplace Maya: Aaah! There's a cold breeze coming from this hearth! Atmey: Hee hee hee hee... It seems you've fallen for my little deception. You see, this fireplace conceals a rather unexpected device. ...Yes! A high-tech air conditioner! Maya: Wh-Why would you put an air conditioner in there? Atmey: In the summer it acts as an air conditioner and in the winter, it's a heater. Clever? Talk The night of the crime Phoenix: You mentioned before that you were on guard all alone last night. Atmey: Precisely. This is my fifth encounter with my arch-enemy. I refuse to allow anyone to interfere with the rightful pursuit of my prey. Maya: I heard you've been after Mask\u2606DeMasque since his very first theft? Atmey: Yes, my dear. I see you've done your homework. In his very first heist, that vile thief pilfered the famous jewel, the \"Tear of Emanon\"! I first encountered him in the museum's sacred hall. The crime scene itself! Maya: So... that's why you were hired as security for the Treasure Exhibit? Phoenix: (I'm pretty sure he said that Adrian Andrews hired him...) Atmey: Yes, I borrowed some equipment from Lordly Tailor and set the perfect trap. Phoenix: You must mean the security camera... Maya: But I thought you were watching the area yourself, too. So how did Mask\u2606DeMasque manage to steal the urn? Phoenix: That's the million dollar question... What is DeMasque's modus operandi? Sacred Urn Maya: Umm... Mr. Atmey? Did you know about the Sacred Urn? Atmey: I'm interested in only one thing my dear, and that is Mask\u2606DeMasque! Sacred Urn...? Pfft! That has nothing to do with this case. Phoenix: But... wasn't that what Mask\u2606DeMasque stole this time? Atmey: I am a hunter, sir! That urn was nothing more than a lure to catch my prey. Do you yourselves remember the shape of the individual peanuts you throw to pigeons? Maya: ...I don't think I like this guy's attitude, Nick. Phoenix: Well anyway, it looks like he doesn't know about the urn. DeMasque's M.O. (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Maya: Umm... There's something that's kind of bothering me. Atmey: Please, my dear, ask me anything you like. After all, we are all but seekers, wandering alone in the dark. Maya: Well, I was wondering how Mask\u2606DeMasque managed to steal the urn. I mean, isn't it strange that you don't seem to know? Atmey: ... Phoenix: Yeah, now that you mention it, it is strange. After all, you were on guard that night at the scene of the crime. Unless you were sound asleep, you should have at least seen Mask\u2606DeMasque. Atmey: ... 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: Wh-What the!? It's a Psyche-Lock... Maya: Ps-Psyche Lock...? DeMasque's M.O. (subsequent times) Phoenix: Mr. Atmey... You must know more than you're letting on. How did Mask\u2606DeMasque manage to steal the Sacred Urn...? 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Atmey: In order for a secret to remain a secret, it must be kept secret. Phoenix: (Last night Luke Atmey must have encountered Mask\u2606DeMasque... But why would he be trying to hide it...?) Maya: Nick! Go for it! Let's break that Psyche-Lock of his! Phoenix: (...I don't really think she understands what she's talking about. Well, it's been a while, but let's give this a shot...) Psyche-Lock (appears after \"DeMasque's M.O.\", before breaking Psyche-Lock) Maya: Hey, Nick, what is this Psyche-Lock thing? Phoenix: Well, your magatama lets me see when people are keeping secrets. By breaking their mental \"locks\", I can find out what those secrets are. Maya: Whaaaaat!? This Magatama has THAT kind of power!? Phoenix: ... Maya, you're the one who gave me this Magatama last year... Maya: ...Well, it's true that this Magatama is a prized Fey family heirloom, but... Pearly was the one that actually imbued it with spiritual powers, right? That's why I don't really know much about what it can do. Phoenix: (This is the woman that's going to take over the Kurain Channeling School someday!?) Maya: So how do you do it? How do you break the Psyche-Lock thing? Phoenix: ...Well, you present the Magatama to the person with the secret. Maya: ...Cool! I can't wait to see it in action! Come on! Try it out! Phoenix: (Oh boy... I think the future Master still needs to learn how to be patient...) DeMasque's M.O. (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Atmey: I can't deny that there may be a small hint of \"truth\" in what you say. Maya: So, you were knocked out when the thief first clobbered you? Atmey: Clobber... What an ugly way of saying it. But I suppose you could put it that way. The coward struck at the precise moment that I turned to look at the computer. Maya: So you never noticed that the thief had entered the warehouse? Atmey: No, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Perhaps the air ducts or the sewer pipes... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here! Maya: Ouch. Mr. Atmey should have his poor head examined. (Changed from [Ouch. He should have his poor head examined.] in the original release) Phoenix: You can say that again. How could he have underestimated the thief that badly? Shichishito updated in the Court Record. DeMasque's M.O. (subsequent times) Atmey: I can't deny that there may be a small hint of \"truth\" in what you say. Maya: So, you were knocked out when the thief first clobbered you?

Present Magatama (after clearing \"DeMasque's M.O.\" Talk option) Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- Mask\u2606DeMasque's M. O.  -- Phoenix: Detective Atmey, you were standing guard at the scene of the crime... There's no way you didn't see Mask\u2606DeMasque commit the crime. Atmey: Well now, I can hardly see why you're so positive about that. Yes, indeed I was guarding the warehouse. That much is true. But I can tell you for certain that not a single person passed through that door. Phoenix: (I'm not sure why... But this Atmey guy is lying through his teeth. ...I know. I'll show him some proof!) Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night! Present Camera Data Phoenix: Leads to: \"There was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Atmey: How very interesting that you would present such a thing to me, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective. Unfortunately... It is meaningless. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer. Phoenix: (I guess that's a miss...) Atmey: Well then...? Is there something else I can do for you? Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe I don't have enough evidence yet. If that's true, it could be dangerous for me to push on. But I need to break him!) Leads back to: \"Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night!\" Phoenix: There was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime. It should have automatically taken a photo of anyone that went through that door. Atmey: ...Precisely. Phoenix: I hope you don't mind, but we've already gotten our hands on the camera data. As you can see, the camera went off exactly once last night. Atmey: Wha...! B-But my monocle didn't catch anyone in its flash! It must be some kind of computer malfunction... It-It must be...! Phoenix: Maybe it was your monocle that malfunctioned. Atmey: Wh-What!? Are you saying that I didn't do my duty properly? Phoenix: Detective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night. The question is why are you trying to hide it! (If he's hiding it, there must be some reason! Some reason that he desperately wants to keep hidden... And I've got just the piece of evidence that should prove it!) OK, let's suppose you didn't manage to see Mask\u2606DeMasque. In that case, the reason you didn't at that time was because you were... fast asleep. Atmey: ...I'm afraid that making a guess is not enough. Time to put your money where your mouth is. Show me your evidence! Present anything Phoenix: Atmey: ...May I give you a piece of good advice, Sir Lawyer? Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Atmey: ...A guess is not the same as a theory. Not scientifically, anyway. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer. Phoenix: (Argh! I guess I need to think this over again!) Leads back to: \"Detective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night.\" using the bathroom. Atmey: ...I'm afraid that making a guess is not enough. Time to put your money where your mouth is.

Phoenix: (Argh! I guess I need to think this over again!) Leads back to: \"Detective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night.\" Phoenix: Detective Atmey... You were knocked unconscious by the thief, weren't you!? Atmey: Ha ha ha! Surely you must be joking... You think that I, Luke Atmey, could be knocked unconscious so easily!? Phoenix: This sword proves it! Atmey: ...! Th-That's... Phoenix: Before the theft, this sword was in the hand of the statue of Ami Fey. Furthermore... at that time, it was not bent. Atmey: Aaah... Err... Phoenix: ...There's only one explanation. You were struck on the head and knocked unconscious by this sword! Well, Detective!? How about it!? (Changed from [Well, Detective!? What about it!?] in the original release) Atmey: ...I'm impressed. You truly are an \"Ace Attorney\"... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Ron DeLite profile Atmey: This man surrendered to the police, admitting that he was Mask\u2606DeMasque. Phoenix: Maybe so... But I'm not convinced that he's really behind the thefts. Atmey: He is. Maya: ...He sounds pretty sure. Atmey: Just look at his forehead. It's all in the shape of his mouth and eyes... This is the classic face of a thief. It is unmistakable! Maya: Is there anything that isn't \"unmistakable\" to you... Any other profile Phoenix: What about this person here, Detective Atmey? Atmey: ... Maya: Is something wrong? Did the cat get your tongue or something? Atmey: That photo leaves me with a distinctly indistinct feeling. Phoenix: Ummm... Atmey: In this case, I'm afraid my perspicacity has been left wanting. Phoenix: (I think he's trying to say that he doesn't have any information...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Well it looks like we got one thing cleared up anyway. Maya: Huh? What? That Atmey is the greatest Ace Detective in the world? Phoenix: No, that he never actually saw the thief. Maya: Oh... that's right! So the thief may not even be Mask\u2606DeMasque... Atmey: Just one moment, Sir Lawyer! The thief was unquestionably Mask\u2606DeMasque! Maya: But you never actually saw him! Atmey: Perhaps so, but I installed a security camera for just such a contingency. Maya: Oh... Atmey: Last night, the camera went off exactly once. Behold! This is a photo of the dastardly thief, taken by the security camera! Phoenix: ...Th-That's him! Maya: M-Mask\u2606DeMasque...! Security Camera Photo added to the Court Record. Atmey: The thief can be none other than the arch-criminal, Mask\u2606DeMasque. After all, he has a very good reason for committing such brazen crimes. Phoenix: Wh-What are you talking about? Talk DeMasque's reason Phoenix: So... What did you mean by he had a \"very good reason\"? Atmey: Exactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate. Maya: B-But how would you know about that...? Atmey: Hmph. Have you forgotten? You're speaking to the finest Ace Detective ever to walk on the face of the earth! The most brilliant mind since ...well, EVER! Luke Atmey! Phoenix: (*sigh* Well, I guess we'd better go take a look, just in case...) DeMasque's Hideout (after clearing \"DeMasque's reason\" Talk option in Atmey Detective Agency) Examine Green envelope Leads to: \"Hey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?\" Maya: Hey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!? Atmey: Exactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate. Phoenix: A green envelope, huh... Looks like this is it. Maya: OK! Let's have a look! \"If you don't want your true identity revealed to the world... ...come to KB Security at 1:00 AM on October 12th and bring $50,000.\" F-F-F-Fifty thousand...! Phoenix: Th-Th... This is a... B-B-Blackmail letter... (It sure looks like a major clue alright!) Blackmail Letter added to the Court Record. ...*ding-dong*... Desir\u00e9e: Oh! Someone's at the door! I'll be right back. Won't take but a second, I promise. (Oh, thank you for coming! That's so nice of you!) ???: (When I see a damsel in distress, I just can't help myself!) Desir\u00e9e: (Please, come on in! I'll make some coffee.) ???: (Really? OK, I guess I'll make myself at home, pretty lady!) Phoenix: (...Wait a minute. I know that voice...) Desir\u00e9e: Oh, Nicky boy, I'm so sorry, but I've got another guest! ???: Aaaaaaaaaaaah!! You... You're... Nick, it's you! And Maya, too! What a fluke! Maya: Ah...! Larry! Long time no see! Desir\u00e9e: What? You know each other? Butz: Ni... \"Nicky boy\"!? Nick, do you and this girl have... you know... something going on? Phoenix: \"S-Something\"? If you mean what I thin-- Butz: I underestimated you, Nick! A gorgeous lady like this? ...And married, too? Way to go, dude! Phoenix: (I knew it. Just when things can't get any worse, it's time to cue in the Butz.) Larry Butz... Ever since grade school, he's been... Not exactly a close friend, but yeah, we know each other. Butz: Hey, man, that wasn't nice! I was your very first client! Phoenix: We've got quite the... storied history, he and I. (Changed from [It's been 25 years since I first met Larry.] in the original release) And what we used to say still rings true. When something smells, it's usually the Butz. Butz: Hey, come on now! You're embarrassing me! And in front of this pretty little thing here... Desir\u00e9e: So you two are old childhood friends, I see. That's so sweet! You two go ahead and catch up on old times. I'm going to go check on my bike. Butz: Nice girl, that Dessie... So how have ya been, Nick? Phoenix: (Too busy if you really want to know...) Examine Green envelope Phoenix: So Ron received a blackmail letter, huh? Maya: Do you think Ms. DeLite knows about this? Phoenix: Well if she did, I don't think she would've been smiling like that. Maya: I wonder if we should tell her about it... Phoenix: I think it'd be smarter if we didn't. Talk Larry Butz Phoenix: So what have you been up to this whole time? It's been two years since I heard from you. And what's with these clothes? You look... well, weird. Butz: Hey man, that's uncalled for. This is my uniform, from a my part-time job! But I can't believe it's been two years. They say time flies when you're having fun. Ha ha ha ha... Ah ha... Ha... ...ha? Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong? Butz: Nick... I gotta tell you. Women. ...I don't trust'em anymore. Phoenix: You got dumped again? Butz: Well, you know Bennifer? I followed her all the way to Tibet 2 years ago. That's where I met the famous Katty Tom, and my whole life changed. Phoenix: \"Bennifer\"? \"Katty Tom\"? I never heard of either of them. Butz: Anyway... Dude! Katty Tom chose Hollywood over me! Can you believe it? Maya: Well, actually... Anyway sounds like you had quite the adventure. Butz: Women! They're so... so... Aaaah! Oh... B-But you're different, Maya. You're not like the rest. Phoenix: (...Looks like he's still the same old Larry.) Why are you here? (Changed from [Why you came here] in the original release) Phoenix: So what are you doing here anyway? Butz: Huh...? What do you mean by that? I'm just a natural-born nice guy, that's all. Well, actually... I picked this up last night while I was working. Phoenix: ...A wallet? You say you found this last night? Butz: Yeah, it had a driver's license in it, so I figured I'd just return it myself. Ron's Wallet added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Hang on... Let me see that for a minute. ... I know it. Dessie's picture is in here. Butz: Yeah, I guess he really digs his wife, huh? ... Hey, Nick... It's not what you're thinking at all! Phoenix: No, I'm pretty sure it is. You haven't changed a bit. Butz: Aw, no way man! I mean, she's a married woman! That's just bad news! Phoenix: (He really IS here just to check out Ms. DeLite...) Maya: So you said you found it at your job, right? Butz: Yeah! I'm working for a private security company as a guard! Chicks just love a guy in uniform, you know! Phoenix: (A security guard, huh. So that's what that uniform is all about...) Why are you here? (Changed from [Why you came here] in the original release) (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what are you doing here anyway? Butz: Huh...? What do you mean by that? I'm just a natural-born nice guy, that's all. Well, actually... I picked this up last night while I was working. Phoenix: ...A wallet? You say you found this last night? Butz: Yeah, it had a driver's license in it, so I figured I'd just return it myself. Wallet (appears after \"Why are you here?\") Phoenix: So what time was it when you found this last night? Butz: Huh? Why are you asking that!? Trying to see if I've got an \"alibi\"!? Phoenix: (Umm... You're not the one on the hook for a crime this time, buddy.) Butz: I guess it was around 1:00 in the morning on the first floor of our company building. Phoenix: (What was Mr. DeLite's wallet doing there...?) Butz: ...Anyway, there's nothing weird about that. After all, he works there. Maya: He... works there? You mean... Mr. DeLite? Butz: Sure. Here, take a look at this. It's right there in his wallet. Maya: What's this card? Butz: It's a key card for the security company. See! It's got a serial number on it right there. There's no mistake about it. (Changed form [Hey! It's got a serial number on it right there. There's no mistake about it.] in the original release) Phoenix: You said you were working part-time at a \"security company\", right? Butz: That's right. ...Wh-Why are you making that scary face? Phoenix: (\"Security company\", huh... Something's not quite secure about Larry working there... I need to find out as much as I can about this key card...) Key Card added to the Court Record. Wallet (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what time was it when you found this last night? Butz: Huh? Why are you asking that!? Trying to see if I've got an \"alibi\"!? Phoenix: (Umm...

Phoenix: (\"Security company\", huh... Something's not quite secure about Larry working there... I need to find out as much as I can about this key card...) Key Card added to the Court Record. KB Security (appears after presenting Blackmail Letter) Phoenix: KB Security, the company in the blackmail letter! You know about it!? Butz: That's where I work, yeah. In fact, I'm on the job right now. Maya: Huh...? So what are you doing here then? Butz: Well, the boss is away right now, and you know what mice do when the cat's away... Phoenix: ...Yes, yes. *sigh* Anyway, how far away is this company? Butz: Lemme see... About 30 minutes by car, I guess... Well, if you fly down the road, anyway. Phoenix: Hmm. Well, this apartment building is pretty close to Lordly Tailor, right? Maya: And it would take roughly an hour to go from here to KB Security and back. Phoenix: If Ron DeLite was at KB Security when the robbery occurred, then... Maya: Whoa...! Then he couldn't have stolen Sacred Urn! Present Treasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue, Sacred Urn, or Shichishito Phoenix: Larry, this is one of the treasures from Kurain Village... Butz: Be serious, Nick! I couldn't care less about mystic mumbo jumbo stuff! Maya: ... Butz: Ah! Of course Maya is a different story! Phoenix: (Talk about your mixed messages...) Blackmail Letter Phoenix: Hey Larry, what about this? Butz: What? If you've got something to say, then say it already! ... Huh...? A blackmail letter!? Phoenix: Do you know anything about this? Butz: Wh-Wha-What? I don't know anything about Alexis! And that's the truth! Phoenix: ... Huh? What? Butz: I-I can't believe you'd do this to me! I thought you were my friend! Fifty thousand dollars! I don't have that kind of money! Phoenix: No, no, you don't understand! This blackmail letter was sent to Ron DeLite! Butz: Wheeeew! Man, you scared me!! I almost had a heart attack, you idiot! Phoenix: Wait, I'm the idiot!? Butz: Man, I was totally confused because it says, \"KB Security\" right on the envelope. Maya: Um, yeah... So what? Butz: That's where I've got a part-time job! At KB Security! Maya: Wh... Whaaaat! Phoenix: (Sounds like I should really find out some more about this KB Security company!) Ron's Wallet Phoenix: You didn't touch anything in the wallet, did you? Butz: Hey man, be serious! You know what I was interested in! Phoenix: (If Mask\u2606DeMasque doesn't look out, he's gonna be the victim of a robbery himself!) Key Card Phoenix: So you're sure about this key card? Butz: Yup. That's the key card we use at the building I work in. (Changed from [Yup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in.] in the original release) According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a record. Maya: It leaves a record? Butz: Yeah, it tells you exactly who entered the room and when. Phoenix: Larry! I need that data...! Butz: Whoa! Slow down, man! Sorry, but that data is off limits to outsiders. If I lost this job, I'd never have a chance with Dessie... Phoenix: (It's times like these when I wish lawyers weren't so powerless...) Key Card updated in the Court Record. Key Card (subsequent times) Phoenix: So you're sure about this key card? Butz: Yup.

Phoenix: (It's times like these when I wish lawyers weren't so powerless...) Phoenix Wright profile Butz: You're 26 years old, right? Don't you think it's about time you took a long, hard look at your life? Phoenix: ... Coming from a guy who can only brag about how many times he's been rejected... I find that kind of... ironic. Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You've even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look totally different than two years ago. Don't you think Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh! What a cutie! Hey, Nick! So what's the deal between you and this girl? Maya: Hey! That's my cousin! Her name is Pearl Fey. Butz: Pearl, huh... Too bad. Never date two girls with the same name... That's one rule I can't break. Phoenix: (...I'd think the fact that she's only 9 years old would break some rule somewhere!) Adrian Andrews profile Butz: WHOA! WHO is this! Come on, man, don't hold out on me! Phoenix: Forget about it. It's on a need to know basis and you don't need to kn-- Butz: Hey now! I thought we were pals! I got a MAJOR thing for girls with black sleeveless shirts and glasses! Phoenix: How do you know that!? Butz: And if they have an orange-colored memo pad, I really lose my cool! Phoenix: (He has to be making that up... He can't really know Adrian... Can he...?) Mask\u2606DeMasque profile Butz: I just thought of something! What if it's actually a hot chick under that costume! Phoenix: Forget about it. It's a guy, trust me. Butz: Man! You're killin' my buzz, dude! Maya: Boy, talk about someone who has a one track mind... Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile Butz: That Dessie is one awesome lady alright! It's been a long time since I've felt this way... I think I'm really in love this time! Maya: A long time, huh? Butz: Yeah! Well, err... Except for what I feel for you, Maya! Phoenix: (I don't think even HE knows what he's saying anymore.) Larry Butz profile Butz: Even you could learn a few tricks from me, Nick! Phoenix: ...Yeah? Like what? Butz: Look at my hair for example. It points up straight, right? But your hair, on the other hand, points backwards. That's no good at all, man! It's defeatist! You gotta aim high... for the stars! Phoenix: (I... I can't find a counter-argument to that...) Any other evidence Phoenix: ...What about this? Does anything come to mind? Butz: Listen, I'm a security guard. I'm not here to sell you juicy bits of info and chew the fat, man. Phoenix: (Funny, you had no qualms about selling Samurai Dogs just 2 years ago.) Any other profile Phoenix: Larry, what about this person...? Butz: Beats me. Phoenix: (What the...? All of a sudden, he's got nothing to say...?) After clearing \"Wallet\" and \"KB Security\" Talk options and presenting Key Card: Phone: ... Maya: Hey, Nick! Your phone! (Changed from [Oh, Nick! Your phone!] in the original release) Phone: ...*beep*... Pearl: H-Hello? Is this the Wright residence? Phoenix: Ah! Pearls! Where are you!? Pearl: I-I thought I'd go to Lordly Tailor to try to find some more clues, but... ...I'm afraid I've gotten lost. Maya: Whaaaat!? Give me that phone, Nick! P-Pearly! Where are you right now!? Pearl: Um... I was walking along and I found myself in front of that person's office. Maya: \"That person\"...? Who!? Pearl: Um, the person who doesn't act his age and always says, \"Zvarri!\" when he's excited... Phoenix: (Luke Atmey, Ace Detective...) OK, stay right there! We're coming to get you! Pearl: A-Alright... I-I'm a little scared... Phone: ...*beep*... Phoenix: Alright! Let's go, Maya! Butz: Wait a second, Nick! Phoenix: Wh-What? Butz: That phone call just now... Sounded like real cutie... Another one of your, ahem, ...\"special friends\"? Phoenix: .......... Say goodbye to Ms. DeLite for me, would you Larry? October 12Atmey Detective Agency Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya! Maya: Pearly! Pearl: I never thought I'd see the two of you again! Phoenix: ...So is Mr. Ace Detective out of the office? Pearl: Yes, when I arrived here... ...there wasn't a single soul in sight. Maya: Say, Nick... Doesn't look like something's changed since we were here last? Phoenix: (Now that you mention it...) Examine Bag Leads to: \"This bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before.\" Maya: This bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before. Pearl: It looks quite full... I wonder what could be in here? Maya: Hey, Nick! Come on! Open it up! Phoenix: Hey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property! Maya: Don't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Phoenix: (That's true... And truth be told, I have to admit I am kind of curious...) Maya: Well? What's in there? Phoenix: H-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...) Atmey: ...Well, hello there!! Maya: EEEEEEK! H-He's here! Atmey: ...What are you doing, Sir Lawyer? I'm shocked to see a servant of the court ignoring the law so flagrantly! Phoenix: I-I'm really sorry! M-Maya made me do it! Maya: Nick! I can't believe you! Atmey: A gentlemen never uses a lady as an excuse for his own poor behavior... The real question is... Can you afford to waste time lollygagging about here? Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean by that? Atmey: Perhaps I should make myself more clear? Tomorrow's trial... Zvarri! Shall we say the figurative Sir William will be dropping his panties before lunchtime? Maya: Wow, Nick! Sounds like it's gonna be really exciting. Examine Bag Maya: So what's in there, Nick? What's in the bag? Phoenix: The way Atmey barged in like that, I never actually got the chance to look! Pearl: I know. I thought I was going to collapse of shock, too! Phoenix: (But from the feel of it, it was something hard...) Talk Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: Umm... What's going to happen at the trial tomorrow that's so dramatic? Atmey: Do you know what your biggest mistake so far has been, Sir Lawyer? ...It was becoming a lawyer in the first place. Pearl: ...That certainly does sound like a big mistake, Mr. Nick. Atmey: Tomorrow will be a day to remember. I, Luke Atmey, will take the stand! And then... Zvarri! My testimony will prove to be the undoing of the lot of you! Yes! All of you! I will unmask you as the thief's co-conspirators! Maya: C-C-Conspirators!? Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... You're quick on the defensive, I see! However! It is not I that is your greatest enemy! There is a far more dangerous threat that you will face during the trial. Maya: Wh-What are you talking about...? Atmey: Sir Lawyer... If you truly are who you say, I'm sure you've heard of him. ...His name is \"Godot\". Phoenix: G-Godot...? DeMasque's identity Atmey: You have taken a step down the path of foolishness. To try to defend a career criminal who deserves nothing less than the death penalt-- Maya: Hey! Last time I checked, no one knows for sure that Mr. DeLite really is DeMasque! Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... My dear lady... Times may change, but people, sadly, do not... ...Well. You will understand this when you are more mature. Godot (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\") Maya: Um... Who is this \"Godot\" person...? Atmey: ...It's not surprising that a spirit medium has not heard the name. Godot. The prosecutor whose equal cannot be found in this country, but in heaven. Godot. A legend or myth... Men pin a lifetime of hopes on the chance to simply meet him. Pearl: Prosecutor Godot... (Changed from [Prosecutor...] in the original release) Maya: But the best prosecutor in the country isn't Godot, it's Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right, Nick!? Atmey: ...It's no surprise that a spirit medium such as yourself would know nothing of this. But Ace Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth is currently traveling abroad. Maya: Huh...? Atmey: In fact, it was Mr. Edgeworth who acknowledged Godot as the best in this country. Pearl: And you agree with that? Atmey: Most certainly. In fact, you could call him the Luke Atmey of the Prosecutor's Office. Maya: Well, that's good to hear! The prosecution has a fighting chance tomorrow! Pearl: Mr. Nick, is this \"Godot\" really that strong? Phoenix: Hmm... I seem to remember hearing about something like that... Atmey: Not surprising... Some people spend their entire lives idly waiting for his appearance. Present Anything Maya: Ummm, Mr. Atmey...? Could you take a look at this? Atmey: Oh please. You can drop the pretense already. Maya: Huh...? Atmey: You and I are already fated to fight each other... And the only true weapon for warriors in a court of law is information! Surely you don't expect me to sharpen your sword for you! Maya: ...Creep. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: (It looks like we're done investigating for the day.) Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... Sir Lawyer... The stage has been set and all the pieces are finally in place. All that remains now... is for the dance to begin! Phoenix: (A new prosecutor, an Ace Detective and a thief... This will be one tough trial.) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh!

That doesn't mean that I didn't commit the crime.Phoenix: (Normally, when I say \"Of course you didn't\" I'm being sarcastic, but you... Yikes!)Ron: Anyway, I admit that I'm guilty...

I'm counting on you, Nicky boy! Good luck!Phoenix: (To be honest, I really don't know whether Ron is Mask\u2606DeMasque or not. But there's only one thing I AM sure of.

I'm not! I will pass judgement after I hear arguments from both sides.???: Well, if you're not ready yourself, you shouldn't expect others to be. That's a rule to live by.Judge: ...Um, wh-who are you?Godot: I am Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.Maya: Ah! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...Judge: Yes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?Godot: Ha...! None.Judge: What did you say...?Godot: I've never prosecuted a case before.Judge: N-Never? But you said you've never lost before.Godot: ...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.Judge: Quite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?Godot: Even the mightiest of redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.Judge: Yes, but... A mask? In a court of law?Godot: Ha...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.Judge: ...!Maya: This guy is the real deal alright, Nick...Phoenix: (Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the \"real deal\"...?)Godot: So we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!Phoenix: ...?Maya: N-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?Phoenix: No. I don't have any friends that call me \"Trite\".

What you know about the thief that stole the urn.Gumshoe: Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Crimes --Gumshoe: Mask\u2606DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago. He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime! This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor. His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces. That's why we're sure it was Mask\u2606DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!Judge: Hmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask\u2606DeMasque is... M-Mr. Godot! W-What are you--!? (Changed from [M-Mr. Godot! Y-You!] in the original release) W-We're in the middle of a trial here, Mr. Godot!Godot: Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee.

You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)Judge: Proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Maya: Well, Nick?

Except maybe for the thief's mom, that is! Phoenix: But isn't there someone who knows even more about him than the police? Gumshoe: You don't mean... \"Detective Zvarri\", do you? Judge: Hmm... Who is this person? Zvarri? He sounds German... Gumshoe: His name is Luke Atmey, sir. I guess I shouldn't have made up such a silly name for him. Phoenix: (What the heck? I guess he's not all that famous after all...) Gumshoe: Anyway, it's true that he did manage to retrieve the last item the thief stole. Judge: ...Oh, I see. It seems you're not the expert you claim to be. Gumshoe: ...Urk! I-It looks like the thief is playing with me, even now! Leads back to cross-examination Leave it Phoenix: (The real \"authority\" on the thief is the other detective. I don't need to ask this one any more questions...) Leads back to cross-examinationGumshoe: He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Have you seen all of these so-called \"calling cards\"? Gumshoe: Of course I have. Except... The person in charge of the Treasure Exhibit never brought their card to the police... So I didn't see this one until after the crime occurred. Maya: That's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police. Judge: Was the calling card that Lordly Tailor received authentic? Gumshoe: Well, all the cards have one common, identifying feature. But we're not releasing that information to the general public... Judge: But you're absolutely certain that this card is real? Phoenix: (Gumshoe can't say it out loud but I bet he's talking about Mask\u2606DeMasque's emblem...)Gumshoe: This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: His fifth heist... And your fifth screw up, huh? Gumshoe: Objection, pal! That ain't fair! Maybe you could say I screwed up four times! But this last time wasn't my fault! I didn't know about the calling card this time! Phoenix: (You of all people shouldn't be chuckling about this, Detective Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: I just want everyone here in the courtroom to know something! If you ever get a calling card from this guy, don't call some stupid private eye! Call your local police right away. Got me? Maya: Wow, it looks like he's really got it in for Detective Atmey.Gumshoe: His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Art pieces? Like what, for example? Gumshoe: Well, his first target was the famous \"Tear of Emanon\". Judge: What's that? Some kind of especially salty teardrop? Gumshoe: N-No, sir. It's a blue diamond. A single, rare diamond. Next was the \"Crown of Bongora\"... You know, the thing you put on your head. After that was the \"Left Hand of Hades\" and then the \"Portrait of Mejeena\", sir. Detective Atmey retrieved the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" and returned it to the museum. Phoenix: And the target of his fifth and last robbery was the \"Sacred Urn\"... right? Judge: But isn't it difficult for him to dispose of such famous art pieces...? Gumshoe: Well, we assume he must have some underworld connections. Maya: Somehow, Mr. DeLite doesn't look the type... Phoenix: (Yeah, he's a little too sunny to be hanging out in the underworld...)Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"Gumshoe: That's why we're sure it was Mask\u2606DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean when you say, \"it fits his M. O. to a T\"? Judge: I was thinking of asking the same thing myself. Gumshoe: Ugh... I wish you would listen a little more closely, pal. First of all, there's the calling card. We're 100% certain it's authentic. Then there's the fact that he seemed to know all about the security system. And finally, his target was an art piece. These are all part of the thief's modus operandi. Judge: And so, since this robbery seems to fit all those conditions...? Gumshoe: That's right! It means that Mask\u2606DeMasque is behind it!Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"Maya: Nick!

But...Phoenix: Also, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.Maya: So even though we know it was Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it...Phoenix: (Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it!)-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Crimes --Gumshoe: Mask\u2606DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Have you been involved in the investigation from the beginning? Gumshoe: Yup! Nobody knows more about the thief than me, pal! It's true! I'm a... Zvarri...! \"Author on thieves\"! Phoenix: ... Maya: An \"author\"...? He's written books about thieves?

That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly \"priceless\" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of \"precious art\"!Gumshoe: Wh-What do you mean!?Maya: N-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?Phoenix: No! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.Judge: Well, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?Godot: The appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.Phoenix: So in other words... It was not the kind of item that Mask\u2606DeMasque would normally go after!Gumshoe: Urk!Judge: Hmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was not the work of Mask\u2606DeMasque...!Phoenix: Y-Yes... That's what I'm saying. (Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)Judge: Well... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask\u2606DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?Godot: This coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!Phoenix: Wh-What!?Godot: If you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.Phoenix: Umm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.Godot: If you're saying it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask\u2606DeMasque's methods... A fake.Judge: A-A Fake\u2606DeMasque?Maya: Fake\u2606DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.Godot: Now, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a fake.Judge: Hmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.Phoenix: (It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, Fake\u2606DeMasque!)Present Security Camera Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"The proof is right here.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: What is this evidence supposed to prove? Godot: Ha...! Well, it proves someone here is a fake alright. ...It proves that this lawyer is a fake. Phoenix: (These prosecutors sure know how to twist the knife...) Maya: This is no time to be impressed! Think it over again! When he stole the urn, his photo was taken, right? Who knows? Maybe there's something on there that shows he's a fake... Phoenix: (Hmm... Is she talking about that photo we got from Atmey?) Judge: Are you ready yet, Mr. Wright?  Leads back to: \"It looks like I'm going to have to prove it...\"Phoenix: The proof is right here.Judge: This looks like... a photo taken by a security camera.Phoenix: But if you look closely... you'll notice something peculiar about it.Godot: Ha...! Well then, why don't you go ahead and show us what it is. Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".Present front of Mask\u2606DeMasque's neck Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's right here, of course!\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: It's right here. ...I think. Judge: Is that what was so \"peculiar\"? Godot: Ha...! The place that you're pointing to is all wrong. Phoenix: Wh... What do you mean! Godot: The only thing \"peculiar\" in this courtroom... is on top of your head. Maya: Nick! Are you going to let him get away making fun of your hair!? Phoenix: (Yes... At least until I know he can't use his goggles to fry me or something...) W-Well anyway! There is a strange spot in this photo! Godot: Ha...! Still haven't given up? So what is it then? Leads back to: \"Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\"Phoenix: It's right here, of course!Judge: You mean... Mask\u2606DeMasque?Phoenix: I have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.Maya: Isn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?Phoenix: The problem I have with the security camera photo is the broach on DeMasque's chest.Judge: A Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!Phoenix: ...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.Judge: A clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!Gumshoe: But the Mask\u2606DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no broach!!Phoenix: That broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\" is a fake!Gumshoe: ...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!Judge: O-Order! It's true... Undeniably true... Detective Gumshoe! How... How could you have overlooked this!?Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! I don't know how I...Godot: Hey now... ...If you're gonna have a pity party, invite me, too!Judge: M-Mr. Godot! You deserve some blame in this, too! How could you have overlooked such a large broach...?Godot: Ha...! The broach you're talking about... Do you mean this?Gumshoe: Ah...!Phoenix: Th-That's...! Mask\u2606DeMasque's broach!Judge: Wh-Where did you find it!?Godot: Well I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.Phoenix: (\"Buddha statue\"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)Gumshoe: Wh-Why didn't you tell me about that, sir!?Godot: ...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.Maya: Grrr... This guy is one cool customer.Godot: It's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little hickeys on there, too.Judge: H-Hickeys?Godot: Figuratively speaking, of course... I'm referring to Ron DeLite's fingerprints.Gumshoe: Whaaa...?Judge: What!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!Godot: I've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.Judge: Hmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been torn off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.Godot: Obviously there must have been a big struggle that night at the crime scene.Phoenix: (Uh oh... Phoenix, we have a problem...)DeMasque's Broach added to the Court Record.Godot: Ha...! You mess with Godot... ...and you get burned.Phoenix: (Grr... He's been playing me like a violin...)Godot: Well Judge, I'm about ready to call my next witness.Gumshoe: Huh? You're done with me? But I haven't proved anything yet.Godot: You've proven your own incompetence. That's good enough.Gumshoe: ...That doesn't sound good at all.Judge: Bailiff! Bring the next witness into the courtroom!Phoenix: (Finally time for the Ace Detective to make his appearance, huh...?)Godot: One second is one drip of the coffee pot. Let's hurry it up.Atmey: SHHH! SILENCE!... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.Judge: Wh-What's clear?Atmey: ...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?Judge: W-Well, yes. That's right.Godot: Ha...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.Atmey: Well, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.Maya: Boy, these two make a perfect pair...Phoenix: They'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.Judge: I've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.Atmey: ...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.Judge: Hmm...Phoenix: (Why was this guy all by himself anyway...? There must be some reason. I'm sure of it!)Judge: Well then, tell us what this special monocle of yours witnessed!Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Atmey: It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed. That's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask\u2606DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me! Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head! Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone. Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!Judge: So you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?Atmey: My specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.Judge: ...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.Atmey: Well, Sir Old-Timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask\u2606DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!Judge: Hmm... Very well. Proceed with the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Witnessed --Atmey: It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So that would be one o'clock on the morning of the 12th, correct? Atmey: That's an impressive deduction, Sir Lawyer. Phoenix: You were on security duty that night. Where exactly were you at the time? Atmey: A penetrating question! I was in the basement warehouse, near the computer. Phoenix: (Near the computer, huh...) Judge: So then you weren't trying to remain hidden, I take it? Atmey: Up to this point, I have tried to remain concealed while waiting for the thief... Phoenix: (Yeah, he said the same thing yesterday, too.) Maya: Gumshoe also said that he never saw him at the crime scene... Atmey: Precisely! That is precisely why I chose NOT to hide last night. I knew that by NOT concealing myself, I would be putting pressure on the thief. Phoenix: (Looks like the thief was the one applying pressure... On your pidgeony head, that is.) Atmey: In any case!Atmey: That's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask\u2606DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Dancingly descended\"...? From where exactly? Atmey: Well... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else? Phoenix: (So in actuality, he neither \"danced\" nor \"descended\"! ...Someone please save me.) Um... So how is it that you didn't notice the thief? Atmey: My eyes were looking for the thief's shadow while my ears listened for his footfalls. But even so, the dastardly criminal managed to sneak up on me... It can only be due to his subtly camouflaged cape and soft-soled shoes. Phoenix: (... I hereby dub you \"Ace Dunce\".)Atmey: Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't see the criminal's face when that happened? Atmey: ...Well, that's difficult part. How should I put it... I saw his mask... That's all that I can recall. Judge: Hmm... That's not very solid as far as testimony goes. Atmey: However... Fortunately I had my third monocle, the security camera, at the ready. It captured his image perfectly... This should be sufficient, I believe? Judge: Hmm, well, as long as this photo is authentic, I don't see a problem here. Well, Mr. Godot? Do you have a problem with the photo? Good. Then let's continue with the testimony.Present DeMasque's Broach Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Mr. Atmey.\"Atmey: Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Attacked and knocked unconscious? And you weren't able to do a thing? There's certainly some very impressive detective work. Atmey: Hmph! Well, Sir Lawyer! Have you ever been suddenly struck on the head? Phoenix: Huh!? W-Well.. Actually, yes. By a fire extinguisher. Atmey: And what happened? Phoenix: ...I-I was knocked out. Maya: And you lost your memory, too! Atmey: You see? You have no right to look down on me then, do you? The only reason I didn't lose my memory was because I have more brains to begin with. Phoenix: (He may have brains, but the wiring to the self-reflection part seems to be served...) Atmey: In any case, that was how I was knocked senseless. And then...Present DeMasque's Broach Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Mr. Atmey.\"Atmey: Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: About this \"30 minutes\"... Atmey: My silver cord was loosened and my soul fled to the Golden Halls of Elysium... Maya: As usual, I have no idea what this guy is saying. Phoenix: I think he's saying that he was out cold. Judge: So... What happened during these 30 minutes? Atmey: No one can say, Your Honor... That span of time has truly vanished into the ether! Phoenix: (Just what is he going on about!?)Maya: There's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?Phoenix: Also, he says he was knocked unconscious before he could fight back... But that can't be right. It contradicts the evidence.Maya: Huh? Which piece...?Phoenix: (The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Phoenix Wright\nDescription: Me. What more can I say?

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the provided story, characters, evidences, and testimonies.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the testimonies given by Luke Atmey. His testimonies are:\n\n1. It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\n2. That's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask\u2606DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\n3. Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\n4. Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\n5. Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\n\nNow, looking at the evidence list. The key evidence that might contradict his testimony is the Shichishito (Evidence 6). The description says that the Shichishito was used to knock Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the back of the head. However, in his testimony (Testimony 3), Atmey claims he was struck on the head from behind and knocked unconscious before he could strike back. \n\nBut wait, the Shichishito was in the statue's hand. If Atmey was hit from behind, the sword would have been in the statue's hand. But the evidence states that the sword wasn't bent before the crime. If the sword was used to hit Atmey, it should have been bent. However, in the story, when Phoenix presents the Shichishito to Atmey, he breaks the Psyche-Lock by showing that the sword was used to knock him out, which contradicts his claim that he didn't see the thief because he was hit from behind. The sword's presence and condition (being bent) contradict his testimony that he was struck by the thief, implying that the sword (from the statue) was the weapon, which would mean the statue was moved. Therefore, Atmey's testimony about being struck by the thief is contradicted by the evidence that the statue's sword was used, which was moved during the crime."

Butz: Wh-Wha-What? I don't know anything about Alexis! And that's the truth! Phoenix: ... Huh? What? Butz: I-I can't believe you'd do this to me! I thought you were my friend! Fifty thousand dollars! I don't have that kind of money! Phoenix: No, no, you don't understand! This blackmail letter was sent to Ron DeLite! Butz: Wheeeew! Man, you scared me!! I almost had a heart attack, you idiot! Phoenix: Wait, I'm the idiot!? Butz: Man, I was totally confused because it says, \"KB Security\" right on the envelope. Maya: Um, yeah... So what? Butz: That's where I've got a part-time job! At KB Security! Maya: Wh... Whaaaat! Phoenix: (Sounds like I should really find out some more about this KB Security company!) Ron's Wallet Phoenix: You didn't touch anything in the wallet, did you? Butz: Hey man, be serious! You know what I was interested in! Phoenix: (If Mask\u2606DeMasque doesn't look out, he's gonna be the victim of a robbery himself!)

That's the key card they use at the building I work in.] in the original release) According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office.

Don't you think it's about time you took a long, hard look at your life? Phoenix: ... Coming from a guy who can only brag about how many times he's been rejected... I find that kind of... ironic.

Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You've even cuter than the last time I saw you.

Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya! Maya: Pearly! Pearl: I never thought I'd see the two of you again! Phoenix: ...So is Mr. Ace Detective out of the office?

Examine Bag Leads to: \"This bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before.\" Maya: This bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before. Pearl: It looks quite full... I wonder what could be in here? Maya: Hey, Nick! Come on! Open it up! Phoenix: Hey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property! Maya: Don't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Phoenix: (That's true... And truth be told, I have to admit I am kind of curious...) Maya: Well? What's in there? Phoenix: H-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...) Atmey: ...Well, hello there!! Maya: EEEEEEK! H-He's here! Atmey: ...What are you doing, Sir Lawyer? I'm shocked to see a servant of the court ignoring the law so flagrantly! Phoenix: I-I'm really sorry! M-Maya made me do it! Maya: Nick! I can't believe you! Atmey: A gentlemen never uses a lady as an excuse for his own poor behavior... The real question is... Can you afford to waste time lollygagging about here? Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean by that? Atmey: Perhaps I should make myself more clear? Tomorrow's trial... Zvarri! Shall we say the figurative Sir William will be dropping his panties before lunchtime? Maya: Wow, Nick! Sounds like it's gonna be really exciting. Examine Bag Maya: So what's in there, Nick? What's in the bag? Phoenix: The way Atmey barged in like that, I never actually got the chance to look! Pearl: I know. I thought I was going to collapse of shock, too! Phoenix: (But from the feel of it, it was something hard...) Talk Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: Umm... What's going to happen at the trial tomorrow that's so dramatic? Atmey: Do you know what your biggest mistake so far has been, Sir Lawyer? ...It was becoming a lawyer in the first place. Pearl: ...That certainly does sound like a big mistake, Mr. Nick. Atmey: Tomorrow will be a day to remember. I, Luke Atmey, will take the stand! And then... Zvarri! My testimony will prove to be the undoing of the lot of you! Yes! All of you! I will unmask you as the thief's co-conspirators! Maya: C-C-Conspirators!? Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... You're quick on the defensive, I see! However! It is not I that is your greatest enemy! There is a far more dangerous threat that you will face during the trial. Maya: Wh-What are you talking about...? Atmey: Sir Lawyer... If you truly are who you say, I'm sure you've heard of him. ...His name is \"Godot\". Phoenix: G-Godot...? DeMasque's identity Atmey: You have taken a step down the path of foolishness. To try to defend a career criminal who deserves nothing less than the death penalt-- Maya: Hey! Last time I checked, no one knows for sure that Mr. DeLite really is DeMasque! Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... My dear lady... Times may change, but people, sadly, do not... ...Well. You will understand this when you are more mature. Godot (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\") Maya: Um... Who is this \"Godot\" person...? Atmey: ...It's not surprising that a spirit medium has not heard the name. Godot. The prosecutor whose equal cannot be found in this country, but in heaven. Godot. A legend or myth... Men pin a lifetime of hopes on the chance to simply meet him. Pearl: Prosecutor Godot... (Changed from [Prosecutor...] in the original release) Maya: But the best prosecutor in the country isn't Godot, it's Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right, Nick!? Atmey: ...It's no surprise that a spirit medium such as yourself would know nothing of this. But Ace Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth is currently traveling abroad. Maya: Huh...? Atmey: In fact, it was Mr. Edgeworth who acknowledged Godot as the best in this country. Pearl: And you agree with that? Atmey: Most certainly. In fact, you could call him the Luke Atmey of the Prosecutor's Office. Maya: Well, that's good to hear! The prosecution has a fighting chance tomorrow! Pearl: Mr. Nick, is this \"Godot\" really that strong? Phoenix: Hmm... I seem to remember hearing about something like that... Atmey: Not surprising... Some people spend their entire lives idly waiting for his appearance. Present Anything Maya: Ummm, Mr. Atmey...? Could you take a look at this? Atmey: Oh please. You can drop the pretense already. Maya: Huh...? Atmey: You and I are already fated to fight each other... And the only true weapon for warriors in a court of law is information! Surely you don't expect me to sharpen your sword for you! Maya: ...Creep. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: (It looks like we're done investigating for the day.) Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... Sir Lawyer... The stage has been set and all the pieces are finally in place. All that remains now... is for the dance to begin! Phoenix: (A new prosecutor, an Ace Detective and a thief... This will be one tough trial.) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh!

He's at it again.Ron: I sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor! I admit iiiit!!Phoenix: But... You don't have the Sacred Urn, right?Ron: Well, that's true, but... That doesn't mean that I didn't commit the crime.Phoenix: (Normally, when I say \"Of course you didn't\" I'm being sarcastic, but you... Yikes!)Ron: Anyway, I admit that I'm guilty... So make sure they give me a guilty verdict! Pleeeeease!?Desir\u00e9e: Oh, there you are Ronnie! Bonjour, sweetie!Ron: Oh! D-Dessie honey! B-Bonjour! ...Well, actually...

I'm counting on you, Nicky boy! Good luck!Phoenix: (To be honest, I really don't know whether Ron is Mask\u2606DeMasque or not. But there's only one thing I AM sure of. He doesn't have the Sacred Urn right now...)Bailiff: Mr. DeLite!

He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...Judge: Yes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?Godot: Ha...! None.Judge: What did you say...?Godot: I've never prosecuted a case before.Judge: N-Never? But you said you've never lost before.Godot: ...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.Judge: Quite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?Godot: Even the mightiest of redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.Judge: Yes, but... A mask? In a court of law?Godot: Ha...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.Judge: ...!Maya: This guy is the real deal alright, Nick...Phoenix: (Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the \"real deal\"...?)Godot: So we finally meet...

Start talking. ...We're listening.Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir.Judge: Alright, witness. First, let's hear about... What you know about the thief that stole the urn.Gumshoe: Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Crimes --Gumshoe: Mask\u2606DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago. He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime! This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor. His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces. That's why we're sure it was Mask\u2606DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!Judge: Hmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask\u2606DeMasque is... M-Mr. Godot! W-What are you--!? (Changed from [M-Mr. Godot! Y-You!] in the original release) W-We're in the middle of a trial here, Mr. Godot!Godot: Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee. I'm sure you can grant me at least this much... Your Honor. Oh, please. Proceed.Judge: ... Very well. It's only coffee, after all.Phoenix: (What!? You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)Judge: Proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Maya: Well, Nick? What are you going to do?Phoenix: As long as they haven't brought up Mr. DeLite's identity... ...all we can do is show that it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque who stole the urn.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Crimes --Gumshoe: Mask\u2606DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Have you been involved in the investigation from the beginning? Gumshoe: Yup! Nobody knows more about the thief than me, pal! It's true! I'm a... Zvarri...! \"Author on thieves\"! Phoenix: ... Maya: An \"author\"...? He's written books about thieves? Phoenix: Um, I think he probably meant to say \"authority\". Gumshoe: The fact that this guy can slip through even my fingers shows how good he is, pal! Phoenix: (It's easy when those fingers happen to be \"butter fingers\"...) Press harder Phoenix: So nobody knows more about the thief than you, huh...? Gumshoe: You got it, pal! Except maybe for the thief's mom, that is! Phoenix: But isn't there someone who knows even more about him than the police? Gumshoe: You don't mean... \"Detective Zvarri\", do you? Judge: Hmm... Who is this person? Zvarri? He sounds German... Gumshoe: His name is Luke Atmey, sir. I guess I shouldn't have made up such a silly name for him. Phoenix: (What the heck? I guess he's not all that famous after all...) Gumshoe: Anyway, it's true that he did manage to retrieve the last item the thief stole. Judge: ...Oh, I see. It seems you're not the expert you claim to be. Gumshoe: ...Urk! I-It looks like the thief is playing with me, even now! Leads back to cross-examination Leave it Phoenix: (The real \"authority\" on the thief is the other detective. I don't need to ask this one any more questions...) Leads back to cross-examinationGumshoe: He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Have you seen all of these so-called \"calling cards\"? Gumshoe: Of course I have. Except... The person in charge of the Treasure Exhibit never brought their card to the police... So I didn't see this one until after the crime occurred. Maya: That's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police. Judge: Was the calling card that Lordly Tailor received authentic? Gumshoe: Well, all the cards have one common, identifying feature. But we're not releasing that information to the general public... Judge: But you're absolutely certain that this card is real? Phoenix: (Gumshoe can't say it out loud but I bet he's talking about Mask\u2606DeMasque's emblem...)Gumshoe: This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: His fifth heist... And your fifth screw up, huh? Gumshoe: Objection, pal! That ain't fair! Maybe you could say I screwed up four times! But this last time wasn't my fault! I didn't know about the calling card this time! Phoenix: (You of all people shouldn't be chuckling about this, Detective Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: I just want everyone here in the courtroom to know something! If you ever get a calling card from this guy, don't call some stupid private eye! Call your local police right away. Got me? Maya: Wow, it looks like he's really got it in for Detective Atmey.Gumshoe: His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Art pieces? Like what, for example? Gumshoe: Well, his first target was the famous \"Tear of Emanon\". Judge: What's that? Some kind of especially salty teardrop? Gumshoe: N-No, sir. It's a blue diamond. A single, rare diamond. Next was the \"Crown of Bongora\"... You know, the thing you put on your head. After that was the \"Left Hand of Hades\" and then the \"Portrait of Mejeena\", sir. Detective Atmey retrieved the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" and returned it to the museum. Phoenix: And the target of his fifth and last robbery was the \"Sacred Urn\"... right? Judge: But isn't it difficult for him to dispose of such famous art pieces...? Gumshoe: Well, we assume he must have some underworld connections. Maya: Somehow, Mr. DeLite doesn't look the type... Phoenix: (Yeah, he's a little too sunny to be hanging out in the underworld...)Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"Gumshoe: That's why we're sure it was Mask\u2606DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean when you say, \"it fits his M. O. to a T\"? Judge: I was thinking of asking the same thing myself. Gumshoe: Ugh... I wish you would listen a little more closely, pal. First of all, there's the calling card. We're 100% certain it's authentic. Then there's the fact that he seemed to know all about the security system. And finally, his target was an art piece. These are all part of the thief's modus operandi. Judge: And so, since this robbery seems to fit all those conditions...? Gumshoe: That's right! It means that Mask\u2606DeMasque is behind it!Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"Maya: Nick! It definitely looks like it was Mask\u2606DeMasque who stole the urn!Phoenix: But there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask\u2606DeMasque.Maya: But... But...Phoenix: Also, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.Maya: So even though we know it was Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it...Phoenix: (Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it!)-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Crimes --Gumshoe: Mask\u2606DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Have you been involved in the investigation from the beginning?

Who is this person? Zvarri? He sounds German... Gumshoe: His name is Luke Atmey, sir. I guess I shouldn't have made up such a silly name for him. Phoenix: (What the heck? I guess he's not all that famous after all...) Gumshoe: Anyway, it's true that he did manage to retrieve the last item the thief stole. Judge: ...Oh, I see. It seems you're not the expert you claim to be. Gumshoe: ...Urk! I-It looks like the thief is playing with me, even now! Leads back to cross-examination Leave it Phoenix: (The real \"authority\" on the thief is the other detective. I don't need to ask this one any more questions...) Leads back to cross-examinationGumshoe: He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Have you seen all of these so-called \"calling cards\"? Gumshoe: Of course I have. Except... The person in charge of the Treasure Exhibit never brought their card to the police... So I didn't see this one until after the crime occurred. Maya: That's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police. Judge: Was the calling card that Lordly Tailor received authentic? Gumshoe: Well, all the cards have one common, identifying feature. But we're not releasing that information to the general public... Judge: But you're absolutely certain that this card is real? Phoenix: (Gumshoe can't say it out loud but I bet he's talking about Mask\u2606DeMasque's emblem...)Gumshoe: This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: His fifth heist... And your fifth screw up, huh? Gumshoe: Objection, pal! That ain't fair! Maybe you could say I screwed up four times! But this last time wasn't my fault! I didn't know about the calling card this time! Phoenix: (You of all people shouldn't be chuckling about this, Detective Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: I just want everyone here in the courtroom to know something! If you ever get a calling card from this guy, don't call some stupid private eye! Call your local police right away. Got me? Maya: Wow, it looks like he's really got it in for Detective Atmey.Gumshoe: His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Art pieces? Like what, for example? Gumshoe: Well, his first target was the famous \"Tear of Emanon\". Judge: What's that? Some kind of especially salty teardrop? Gumshoe: N-No, sir. It's a blue diamond. A single, rare diamond. Next was the \"Crown of Bongora\"... You know, the thing you put on your head. After that was the \"Left Hand of Hades\" and then the \"Portrait of Mejeena\", sir. Detective Atmey retrieved the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" and returned it to the museum. Phoenix: And the target of his fifth and last robbery was the \"Sacred Urn\"... right? Judge: But isn't it difficult for him to dispose of such famous art pieces...? Gumshoe: Well, we assume he must have some underworld connections. Maya: Somehow, Mr. DeLite doesn't look the type... Phoenix: (Yeah, he's a little too sunny to be hanging out in the underworld...)Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"Gumshoe: That's why we're sure it was Mask\u2606DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean when you say, \"it fits his M. O. to a T\"? Judge: I was thinking of asking the same thing myself. Gumshoe: Ugh... I wish you would listen a little more closely, pal. First of all, there's the calling card. We're 100% certain it's authentic. Then there's the fact that he seemed to know all about the security system. And finally, his target was an art piece. These are all part of the thief's modus operandi. Judge: And so, since this robbery seems to fit all those conditions...? Gumshoe: That's right! It means that Mask\u2606DeMasque is behind it!Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"Maya: Nick! It definitely looks like it was Mask\u2606DeMasque who stole the urn!Phoenix: But there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask\u2606DeMasque.Maya: But... But...Phoenix: Also, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.Maya: So even though we know it was Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it...Phoenix: (Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it!)Phoenix: ...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?Gumshoe: ...Just hearing the \"little\" in that question is making me nervous.Phoenix: You said that he always \"goes after the most precious art pieces\", right?Gumshoe: That's right, pal.Phoenix: But there's one problem... That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly \"priceless\" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of \"precious art\"!Gumshoe: Wh-What do you mean!?Maya: N-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?Phoenix: No! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.Judge: Well, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?Godot: The appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.Phoenix: So in other words... It was not the kind of item that Mask\u2606DeMasque would normally go after!Gumshoe: Urk!Judge: Hmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was not the work of Mask\u2606DeMasque...!Phoenix: Y-Yes... That's what I'm saying. (Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)Judge: Well... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask\u2606DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?Godot: This coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!Phoenix: Wh-What!?Godot: If you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.Phoenix: Umm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.Godot: If you're saying it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask\u2606DeMasque's methods... A fake.Judge: A-A Fake\u2606DeMasque?Maya: Fake\u2606DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.Godot: Now, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a fake.Judge: Hmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.Phoenix: (It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, Fake\u2606DeMasque!)Present Security Camera Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"The proof is right here.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: What is this evidence supposed to prove? Godot: Ha...! Well, it proves someone here is a fake alright. ...It proves that this lawyer is a fake. Phoenix: (These prosecutors sure know how to twist the knife...) Maya: This is no time to be impressed! Think it over again! When he stole the urn, his photo was taken, right? Who knows? Maybe there's something on there that shows he's a fake... Phoenix: (Hmm... Is she talking about that photo we got from Atmey?) Judge: Are you ready yet, Mr. Wright?  Leads back to: \"It looks like I'm going to have to prove it...\"Phoenix: The proof is right here.Judge: This looks like... a photo taken by a security camera.Phoenix: But if you look closely... you'll notice something peculiar about it.Godot: Ha...! Well then, why don't you go ahead and show us what it is. Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".Present front of Mask\u2606DeMasque's neck Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's right here, of course!\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: It's right here. ...I think. Judge: Is that what was so \"peculiar\"? Godot: Ha...! The place that you're pointing to is all wrong. Phoenix: Wh... What do you mean! Godot: The only thing \"peculiar\" in this courtroom... is on top of your head. Maya: Nick! Are you going to let him get away making fun of your hair!? Phoenix: (Yes... At least until I know he can't use his goggles to fry me or something...) W-Well anyway! There is a strange spot in this photo! Godot: Ha...! Still haven't given up? So what is it then? Leads back to: \"Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\"Phoenix: It's right here, of course!Judge: You mean... Mask\u2606DeMasque?Phoenix: I have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.Maya: Isn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?Phoenix: The problem I have with the security camera photo is the broach on DeMasque's chest.Judge: A Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!Phoenix: ...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.Judge: A clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!Gumshoe: But the Mask\u2606DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no broach!!Phoenix: That broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\" is a fake!Gumshoe: ...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!Judge: O-Order! It's true... Undeniably true... Detective Gumshoe! How... How could you have overlooked this!?Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! I don't know how I...Godot: Hey now... ...If you're gonna have a pity party, invite me, too!Judge: M-Mr. Godot! You deserve some blame in this, too! How could you have overlooked such a large broach...?Godot: Ha...! The broach you're talking about... Do you mean this?Gumshoe: Ah...!Phoenix: Th-That's...! Mask\u2606DeMasque's broach!Judge: Wh-Where did you find it!?Godot: Well I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.Phoenix: (\"Buddha statue\"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)Gumshoe: Wh-Why didn't you tell me about that, sir!?Godot: ...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.Maya: Grrr... This guy is one cool customer.Godot: It's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little hickeys on there, too.Judge: H-Hickeys?Godot: Figuratively speaking, of course... I'm referring to Ron DeLite's fingerprints.Gumshoe: Whaaa...?Judge: What!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!Godot: I've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.Judge: Hmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been torn off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.Godot: Obviously there must have been a big struggle that night at the crime scene.Phoenix: (Uh oh... Phoenix, we have a problem...)DeMasque's Broach added to the Court Record.Godot: Ha...! You mess with Godot... ...and you get burned.Phoenix: (Grr... He's been playing me like a violin...)Godot: Well Judge, I'm about ready to call my next witness.Gumshoe: Huh? You're done with me? But I haven't proved anything yet.Godot: You've proven your own incompetence. That's good enough.Gumshoe: ...That doesn't sound good at all.Judge: Bailiff! Bring the next witness into the courtroom!Phoenix: (Finally time for the Ace Detective to make his appearance, huh...?)Godot: One second is one drip of the coffee pot. Let's hurry it up.Atmey: SHHH! SILENCE!... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.Judge: Wh-What's clear?Atmey: ...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?Judge: W-Well, yes. That's right.Godot: Ha...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.Atmey: Well, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.Maya: Boy, these two make a perfect pair...Phoenix: They'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.Judge: I've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.Atmey: ...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.Judge: Hmm...Phoenix: (Why was this guy all by himself anyway...? There must be some reason. I'm sure of it!)Judge: Well then, tell us what this special monocle of yours witnessed!Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Atmey: It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed. That's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask\u2606DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me! Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head! Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone. Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!Judge: So you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?Atmey: My specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.Judge: ...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.Atmey: Well, Sir Old-Timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask\u2606DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!Judge: Hmm... Very well. Proceed with the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Witnessed --Atmey: It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So that would be one o'clock on the morning of the 12th, correct? Atmey: That's an impressive deduction, Sir Lawyer. Phoenix: You were on security duty that night. Where exactly were you at the time? Atmey: A penetrating question! I was in the basement warehouse, near the computer. Phoenix: (Near the computer, huh...) Judge: So then you weren't trying to remain hidden, I take it? Atmey: Up to this point, I have tried to remain concealed while waiting for the thief... Phoenix: (Yeah, he said the same thing yesterday, too.) Maya: Gumshoe also said that he never saw him at the crime scene... Atmey: Precisely! That is precisely why I chose NOT to hide last night. I knew that by NOT concealing myself, I would be putting pressure on the thief. Phoenix: (Looks like the thief was the one applying pressure... On your pidgeony head, that is.) Atmey: In any case!Atmey: That's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask\u2606DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Dancingly descended\"...? From where exactly? Atmey: Well... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else? Phoenix: (So in actuality, he neither \"danced\" nor \"descended\"! ...Someone please save me.) Um... So how is it that you didn't notice the thief? Atmey: My eyes were looking for the thief's shadow while my ears listened for his footfalls. But even so, the dastardly criminal managed to sneak up on me... It can only be due to his subtly camouflaged cape and soft-soled shoes. Phoenix: (... I hereby dub you \"Ace Dunce\".)Atmey: Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't see the criminal's face when that happened? Atmey: ...Well, that's difficult part. How should I put it... I saw his mask... That's all that I can recall. Judge: Hmm... That's not very solid as far as testimony goes. Atmey: However... Fortunately I had my third monocle, the security camera, at the ready. It captured his image perfectly... This should be sufficient, I believe? Judge: Hmm, well, as long as this photo is authentic, I don't see a problem here. Well, Mr. Godot? Do you have a problem with the photo? Good. Then let's continue with the testimony.Present DeMasque's Broach Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Mr. Atmey.\"Atmey: Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Attacked and knocked unconscious? And you weren't able to do a thing? There's certainly some very impressive detective work. Atmey: Hmph! Well, Sir Lawyer! Have you ever been suddenly struck on the head? Phoenix: Huh!? W-Well.. Actually, yes. By a fire extinguisher. Atmey: And what happened? Phoenix: ...I-I was knocked out. Maya: And you lost your memory, too! Atmey: You see? You have no right to look down on me then, do you? The only reason I didn't lose my memory was because I have more brains to begin with. Phoenix: (He may have brains, but the wiring to the self-reflection part seems to be served...) Atmey: In any case, that was how I was knocked senseless. And then...Present DeMasque's Broach Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Mr. Atmey.\"Atmey: Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: About this \"30 minutes\"... Atmey: My silver cord was loosened and my soul fled to the Golden Halls of Elysium... Maya: As usual, I have no idea what this guy is saying. Phoenix: I think he's saying that he was out cold. Judge: So... What happened during these 30 minutes? Atmey: No one can say, Your Honor... That span of time has truly vanished into the ether! Phoenix: (Just what is he going on about!?)Maya: There's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?Phoenix: Also, he says he was knocked unconscious before he could fight back... But that can't be right. It contradicts the evidence.Maya: Huh? Which piece...?Phoenix: (The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)-- What I Witnessed --Atmey: It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So that would be one o'clock on the morning of the 12th, correct?

Which piece...?Phoenix: (The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)Phoenix: ...Mr. Atmey. Could you take a look at this with that special monocle of yours?Atmey: Aha! This belongs to the criminal mastermind, my arch-nemesis, Mask\u2606DeMasque! It is, in point of fact, Mask\u2606DeMasque's broach!Phoenix: It was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. I wonder how that happened?Atmey: Ha... Elementary, my dear lawyer. Obviously it wasn't glued on well enough.Phoenix: Not quite. It clearly shows signs of having been ripped off a piece of clothing.Judge: Ripped off...? Aha!Phoenix: ...We can only deduce that the thief struggled with someone that night! That's the only thing I can think of. And there's only one person that was in a position to have a struggle with the thief. The only person that was on security duty that night...You, Detective Atmey!Atmey: ...Urk!Phoenix: Detective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief that night! (Changed from [Detective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief last night!] in the original release) So, why did you lie in your testimony to the court?Judge: Witness! Giving false testimony is a serious crime!Atmey: Err, I... N-No! W-Wait just a moment, Sir Old-Timer!Judge: Don't talk to me like I'm living in a nursing home!Atmey: Hee hee hee he he he... I just remembered, Your Honor. I was just confused because I've been dealing with so many cases lately.Godot: The true measure of a man is in the amount of work he does. That's what I always say.Maya: Nick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?Phoenix: You talk too much.Judge: Witness! So are you now saying that you and the thief fought?Godot: Hold on. That's quite enough... Your Honor.Judge: E-Excuse me...?Godot: Save the big questions for the testimony. That's one of my rules.Atmey: Indeed! I understand! I, Luke Atmey, agree completely!Witness Testimony-- Fight With The Thief --Atmey: Indeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment. However... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated! Unfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless. A true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough. His first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.Judge: So in the end, you did catch a glimpse of Mask\u2606DeMasque?Atmey: Correct. It was during his third crime that he struck me from behind. It seems that my memory has become a tad jumbled, so to speak.Judge: Hmmm... Well, that's certainly understandable. I, myself, always get confused about which testimony goes with which case.Phoenix: (Th-That can't be good...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Fight With The Thief --Atmey: Indeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So why did you look away from the door anyway? Atmey: In addition to the camera, I had prepared a variety of other sensors as well. The alarm on one of those had gone off, so I had to check the data. That's why I went to the computer! ...Elegantly, of course! Phoenix: So you were momentarily vulnerable when you were working on the computer? (What should I do? Should I ask some more questions...?) That's enough Phoenix: (Well, we know for sure that Atmey looked away from the door. I think I should ask about something else now...) Alright. So you looked away from the door. ...And then? Leads back to cross-examination About the sensor Phoenix: What kind of sensors are you talking about? Atmey: There are other places in the basement that someone could enter and exit from. There are air conditioner ducts, sewer pipes... And a cat door as well. I hooked up heat-detecting, infrared and ultra-violet sensors to each of them. Phoenix: That's a lot of hardware... Was it all yours? Atmey: Lordly Tailor Department Store was kind enough to provide the monitoring hardware. Naturally, the security camera that look the photo belongs to them as well. Phoenix: (In other words, he couldn't have rigged the equipment, huh...?) Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... Has that cleared up any doubts you had about me, Sir Lawyer? Leads back to cross-examination About the computer Phoenix: So did that computer belong to Lordly Tailor as well? Atmey: Correct. Well, except for the program that manages the data. That was specially designed by me, Luke Atmey! Phoenix: (In that case, he could have easily manipulated the data.) Atmey: Hee hee hee hee hee... What's wrong, Sir Lawyer? Leads back to cross-examinationAtmey: However... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... What does that mean? \"Discombobulated\"? Judge: Hmm... Young people these days... They really irritate me. They allow perfectly good old words to die until everyone forgets what they mean. Phoenix: Sorry, but what exactly DOES it mean anyway? Judge: ...Now I've forgotten. What was I saying? Phoenix: (Jeez. It's better than old people who forget what they were saying 5 seconds ago!) Godot: ...Well, it looks like we've cleared that up. You can go on with your testimony.Atmey: Unfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean by \"weapon from the side\"? Atmey: Naturally, that thief had no idea that I, Luke Atmey, was hiding in the area! He grabbed the sword from the statue that was standing by the door to the warehouse. Phoenix: Sword...? You mean the sword that was all twisted like a tree branch? Atmey: Correct. Fortunately for me, the blade was not sharp. Phoenix: (OK. so he IS talking about the Shichishito...) Judge: So the thief armed himself with a sword. And what about yourself, witness?Atmey: A true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You had that much faith in your own fighting abilities? Atmey: But of course. In college, I was the 2nd in-charge of the boxing club. Judge: I'm sorry if I fail to find that appropriately impressive. Atmey: However! My opponent in the ring this time was my arch-nemesis, Mask\u2606DeMasque! Phoenix: (This guy is a real piece of work...)Atmey: His first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can you tell us a little more about what happened? Atmey: My opponent was both powerful and vicious. You might say he was... \"powericious\". Phoenix: (\"P-Powericious\"?) Atmey: I assumed the \"Atmey Fighting Stance\", but a sudden flash of light blinded me! That of course was checkmate! My opponent had bested me. Phoenix: (What do I do now? Should I ask more about this...?) Leave it Phoenix: (Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...) Leads back to cross-examination \"You were blinded\"? Phoenix: So what was this flash of light that blinded you? Atmey: ...I was bathed in a golden light that seemed to come from the statue of the woman. Phoenix: (The statue of Ami Fey, I'm guessing...) Maya: Well that wasn't very much help at all... Leads back to cross-examination \"Atmey Fighting Style\"? Phoenix: What is this \"Atmey Fighting Style\"? Atmey: I'm sorry but that's a trade secret... I really can't say any more. But, I suppose I can tell you if I absolutely must. The main thing is to put your back to the wall. That way no one can get behind you. Phoenix: (That's it...? That's the \"Atmey Fighting Style\"?) Judge: Hmmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What about that testimony...? It was a waste of time. Phoenix: (Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...) Leads back to cross-examination It was very important. Phoenix: Of course it's important! We've learned a detective's SECRET technique, after all. Judge: Yes, indeed... I'll remember to use it if I ever take a walk alone late at night. Phoenix: (Why the heck is he eye-balling me like that...? It's creeping me out...) Judge: ...Now then, witness! We'll go ahead and add that secret information to your official testimony! Changes statement from \"His first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\" to \"I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\"Atmey: I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... Where is this \"third eye\" you're talking about? Atmey: Oh... it's right between my right and left eye brows. ...It's quite invisible to the unenlightened. You may call it the forehead, if you like. Phoenix: (Why didn't you just say that in the first place!?) Atmey: Sir Lawyer! It looks like the creases in your own forehead are getting deeper! Maya: So Mr. Atmey got hit on the forehead then? Phoenix: That's what he says. Maya: Hmm... I've got a funny feeling about that. Phoenix: (Actually, so do I.)Present Shichishito Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.\"Maya: Well what do you think, Nick?Phoenix: Well, there's one thing that I'm absolutely sure of now.Maya: Yeah?

The user provided a lot of story text, characters, evidence, and testimonies. The task is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nLooking at the testimonies from Atmey, specifically Testimony 5: \"I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\" He claims he was hit on the forehead (third eye) when he was fighting the thief.\n\nNow, checking the evidence. Evidence 6 is the Shichishito, which is a ceremonial sword. The description says that DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. \n\nSo the contradiction here is that Atmey says he was hit on the forehead, but the evidence (Shichishito) indicates the injury was on the back of the head. Therefore, Testimony 5 (third eye/forehead) is contradicted by Evidence 6 (back of the head)."

This might just be my chance to turn things around!)Judge: ...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?Phoenix: Very well, Your Honor. The defense asserts that...Mr. Atmey is no Ace Detective! Phoenix: The truth is... this witness is no Ace Detective at all! Atmey: ...So then what exactly are you saying that I am?

You're saying I'm a fake, too? Phoenix: An Ace Detective could never be as forgetful as this guy! Godot: Imposters like you are often suspicious of others as well. Judge: Really, this is too much.

Don't just stand there! This court would like to see this decisive proof you have! Quickly!Phoenix: Huh!? Oh! Y-Yes, of course! (Wh-What's the big rush...?)Maya: Are you alright, Nick?Phoenix: (Atmey looks pretty rattled right now... I'd like to finish this right now if I can. But can I really do it?) The decisive evidence that proves Mr. Luke Atmey is in fact Mask\u2606DeMasque...is right here! Phoenix: As usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor! Judge: Very well then...

Do you have something you wish to say?Godot: Yes, Your Honor... It simply amazes me how quickly times change... In the old days, a man was to be taken at his word. It's truly sad...Judge: You're still denying that Mr. Atmey was involved!?Godot: Before casting aspersions at Detective Atmey, consider the young lady here. Your name is Desir\u00e9e... Desir\u00e9e DeLite. Is that correct?Desir\u00e9e: Y-Yes! What about it?Godot: Ha...! How charming... The lengths that a woman is willing to go to save her husband is truly inspiring.Desir\u00e9e: Wh-What are you insinuating!?Godot: As the wife of the criminal, you could have \"discovered\" that stolen urn anywhere. Including the office of the good detective here. So you found the urn. What does that prove? It certainly doesn't prove where the urn was before you \"found\" it.Desir\u00e9e: What...? I just brought it here from the detective's office!Godot: Please Madame... This town is already filled to the brim with lies. Any more could only compound the tragedy we have been witness to.Desir\u00e9e: You're wrong! I would never...! I would never do such a thing!Phoenix: Ms. DeLite...Desir\u00e9e: Please, Nicky boy! You've got to help me talk some sense into these people!Phoenix: (There must be some way! I've got to prove that urn was actually in the Atmey Detective Agency...)Testify about what I saw Phoenix: ... Godot: What's wrong? Isn't it your job to come up with something to say...? Maya: Nick! Come on! It should be easy to prove! After all, we checked out that bag, didn't we? Phoenix: You're right. I remember doing that. Whatever was in there, it was hard and round... And smooth, too. Maya: Yes! It must have been the urn! It must have! Phoenix: But... I never actually saw it with my own eyes. Maya: ...? Phoenix: Atmey walked in just when I was about to have a look at it... So even if it was the urn in there, I can't testify that it was. Maya: Ack! You're right!! Godot: Ha...! It looks like I was wrong about you, Mr. Trite. In this town overflowing with lies, there's still a single flickering candle of truth. Desir\u00e9e: Nicky boy...! Phoenix: (Well, it's true that I never actually saw the urn... But maybe I can still testify about it from another angle!) Judge: What about it, Mr. Wright? Have you given up yet...? Leads back to: \"There must be some way!\"Show fingerprints on the urn Phoenix: I can prove where the urn was... ...by the fingerprints on it! Judge: Fingerprints, eh... Atmey: Oh come now! Now you're really making me laugh, Sir Lawyer! Fingerprints indeed! Phoenix: ... Atmey: May I go on? Good. Now it would be perfectly understandable if my fingerprints were on the urn. After all, it was I who was guarding the urn in the first place! In any case, I am always in the habit of wearing gloves as you can see. So unfortunately, my fingerprints wouldn't be evidence of anything. Judge: What about it, Mr. Wright? This witness's fingerprints would mean nothing anyway. Maya: N-Nick, what are you going to do now? Phoenix: (I've come too far to turn back now! Atmey must have brought the urn back to his office yesterday... And there, I'm sure someone must have left their fingerprints on it...!) The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn! Present Phoenix Wright profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"So what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Godot: Let me give you an important piece of advice. The one who keeps a cool head all the way until the game's end is the winner. Judge: Let me give you an even more important piece of advice, Mr. Wright... You are not going to win this game with that answer. Maya: Wow... Even the judge is making cool, snappy remarks now... Phoenix: (D-Does that mean I was wrong again? Hmm... The urn was put in that bag and carried to the detective's office yesterday. That means the person I should be fingering is... the person who left their prints on the urn yesterday at the Atmey Detective Agency!) Maya: Do you really think there's someone that could fit the bill? Name another person Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? What have you decided? Phoenix: Your Honor! Please give me just one more chance! Leads back to: \"The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!\" Think it over again Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? What have you decided to do? Phoenix: Forgive me, Your Honor. I've decided to think the whole thing over again. Leads back to: \"There must be some way!\"I can't prove anything yet Phoenix: I can't prove anything yet. Maya: But Nick! Judge: Very well... It looks like that's all then. Godot: Exactly... And this urn is all the proof I need to make my case... Phoenix: What? Godot: You still don't get it, huh? Listen closely, Mr. Trite. This is the urn that Mask\u2606DeMasque stole, right? Now the wife of the accused comes strolling in here with the very same urn, correct? Now, who would you think is the thief? Phoenix: Ah...! Desir\u00e9e: No! That's wrong! That's not why I've got it... Maya: N-Nick! Y-You can't let him do this... Phoenix: (Hmm, this isn't good... There has to be another way around this...) Your Honor! Please let me think it over one more time! Judge: Mr. Wright. It's high time that you learn your lesson. The courtroom is no place for poorly thought-out or rash declarations! Phoenix: (I have to be careful... He won't be so nice next time...) Leads back to: \"There must be some way!\"Atmey: So what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?Phoenix: Mr. Atmey... Do you recall the events of yesterday?Maya: Hey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!Phoenix: Hey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!Maya: Don't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Well? What's in there?Phoenix: H-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)Atmey: ...Well, hello there!!Phoenix: It's true that I didn't get a chance to look in the bag at that time. But! I did touch what was inside.Atmey: Wh-What!? Y-You touched it...?Phoenix: And I remember it very well. It was \"smooth and hard\".Atmey: W-Well, err... Th-That was just...Phoenix: Your Honor! I'd like the court to examine the fingerprints on that urn. If my fingerprints are on there... Then it proves that the urn was in Detective Atmey's office!Godot:Godot: Well, even if your fingerprints are on the urn... ...it still doesn't prove when they were put there, does it?Phoenix: Of course it does.Godot: Wh-What did you just say!?Phoenix: It's not what I say, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said. (Changed from [Not what I said, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said.] in the original release)Andrews: I polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it looks more valuable!Phoenix: If she polished it that much, she must have removed any and all fingerprints on it. And the only chance I had to get my fingerprints on it after that was... Yesterday! At the Atmey Detective Agency!Godot: Ha...! This blend... Godot Blend #107... I've decided... It's a little too bitter after all!Judge: Order! Order! Order! I accept the defense's request! Bailiff! Take this urn and...Atmey: Wait! Wait a moment, Your Honor! ...There's no need for that.Judge: N-No need you say...?Atmey: Precisely... I already know Mr. Wright's fingerprints are on the urn...Judge: Wh-What are you saying!Phoenix: (Yes! I've finally broken him down!)Atmey: Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...Maya: This guy is nuttier than a fruitcake...Atmey: You see! It was me all along! I am the one and only Mask\u2606DeMasque! Ha ha! I hope you all enjoyed my little performance! Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!Judge: Well, Mr. Godot... What's Mr. Atmey's condition?Godot: He's still in the lobby, laughing insanely, Your Honor. I wish I could enjoy the joke as much as he seems to be.Judge: Well, it looks like the matter has been settled. I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"!Maya: Nick, you were right after all!Phoenix: (Yeah! I guess Mr. DeLite really wasn't the thief!)Judge: The court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...???:Ron: You're wrong! Wrong I tell you! Err, umm, I mean... Not exactly wrong so much, but actually not right is what I really trying to sayPhoenix: (Oh no... He's not... This can't be happening...)Ron: The thief... The sneaky, odious thief who's been stealing all the treasures... It's me! I'm him! I'm the one you want! I'm the thief I tell you! So do it...! Pronounce me guilty! Pleeeease!!Phoenix: ...Godot: ...............Judge: I don't know what kind of a kangaroo court you all think this is, but...Phoenix:Phoenix: The true identity of the thief has already been proven! Please hurry and pass judg--Ron: What are you talking about!? I already confessed! I'm the thief I tell you!Judge: ...Mr. Godot! Don't just stand there drinking coffee!Godot: Ha...! Hey there, Mr. Thief...Ron: Y-Yes! Yes, sir!?Godot: If you're really a man, then clean up your own mess.Ron: I-I'm sorry... I'm afraid I just don't have any idea what do you mean.Godot: If you are Mask\u2606DeMasque... then prove it. That's what it means.Ron: Y-Yes, sir! I'll be happy to!Maya: He says he'll be happy to, Nick...Phoenix: It's kinda cute... He's 100% committed to his fantasy.Godot: Good boy! Just remember one thing. A boy only gets one chance in his life to become a man!Ron: I-I know that! I-I won't fail! I swear!Godot: OK, then... Talk! ...We're all listening.Judge: Oh well... Let's all have a listen to this \"confession\"...Witness Testimony-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Identity --Ron: The truth is, I've been Mask\u2606DeMasque all along! I mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask\u2606DeMasque, can you? I don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all! I donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime! Look! You can see right there in the photo! That's me! As for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!Judge: Hmm... I don't like the direction this trial has taken...Phoenix: (But this is how every trial goes... At least with me, anyway...)Godot: Ha...! You're doing great!Ron: Hee hee hee... Stop it, Mr. Godot... You're embarrassing me.Godot: Like I said, you're only going to get one chance to testify, alright? But if you make it through this with flying colors, I'll keep my promise, too. I'll make sure you stay locked up in prison as the one and only true Mask\u2606DeMasque!Ron: Thanks so much, Mr. Godot! I... I'll do my best!Judge: Alright, Mr. Wright. I'm afraid it's time for the cross-examination.Phoenix: *sigh*Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Identity --Ron: The truth is, I've been Mask\u2606DeMasque all along!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You may think you're real Mask\u2606DeMasque... but your wife thinks you're delusional. Ron: I haven't told Dessie yet... About my true identity, I mean... Believe me, I've got my reasons. Phoenix: (With the way your room is decked out, how could she NOT know about it...?) Judge: Hmm... Even thieves have complicated family situations, I suppose. Phoenix: (What should I do? It sounds like we're about to get sidetracked... again.) Press harder Phoenix: So why are you withholding the truth from your wife? Ron: Well... first of all, I don't think she'd believe me anyway... And second... If there's one thing that Dessie absolutely detests... ...it's criminals. Judge: If that's the case, then why did you ever start thieving to begin with? Ron: Well, Dessie is crazy about shopping. She's a real shopaholic... But she's the love of my life, Your Honor. I guess you could say I'm a \"Dessie-aholic\"... Judge: Hmm... So you do have a complicated family situation after all. Phoenix: ...Alright, that's enough. Please continue with your testimony. I beg of you. Leads back to cross-examination Leave it Phoenix: (There's no point in digging through any more of their dirty laundry...) Well, why don't you continue with your testimony for now. Leads back to cross-examinationRon: I mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask\u2606DeMasque, can you?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... I thought you were going to be the one to show US the proof. You know, that you're the real Mask\u2606DeMasque and not just some kind of obsessed fanboy. Ron: Hey now, that's not fair. Why do I have to do all the hard work anywaaaaay!? Phoenix: (Maybe because you're the one making the outrageous claim... for a change.) Maya: Come on, Nick! You know that Mr. DeLite couldn't have committed the crime! You're the one with the fancy law degree! It's time to put it to work already! Phoenix: I need some kind of proof that Ron couldn't possibly be Mask\u2606DeMasque... Maya: Well, I guess if you had that kind of proof, we wouldn't still be here, would we...? Phoenix: (For the time being, maybe I need to shift strategy... I should try to show that Mr. DeLite couldn't have stolen the urn.) Ron: Anyway, I...Present Ron's Wallet or Key Card Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"Ron: I don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You've got no alibi...? Judge: I've been a judge for a long time... And this is the first time I've ever heard a defendant brag about having no alibi. Ron: But I tell you I was in Lordly Tailor that night! ...Errr, no. That's too vague, even for me. To be more precise, I was down in the basement warehouse. Phoenix: (Hold on...) Maya: What is it, Nick? Phoenix: Where was Ron DeLite when the crime happened anyway...? If we can prove he had an alibi after all, this case will be a piece of cake. Maya: W-Well, you're right, but... Godot: Ha...! You think you can prove that? Wake up and smell the coffee! Phoenix: W-Well, I think maybe I can... Judge: Mr. Wright, do you have any evidence that shows the defendant has an alibi? No, I have no evidence. Phoenix: Of course not! Don't be ridiculous! Judge: I-I'm sorry! ...Say! What am I apologizing for!? You! Witness! Hurry up with your testimony already! Ron: I-I'm sorry! ...Why is it that I'm always the one that has to apologize to everyone in the end. Leads back to cross-examination Yes, I have evidence. Phoenix: I have the evidence! Or do you think I'm still some sort of third-rate rookie!? Judge: Oh...! I-I've never seen you this angry before! Godot: ...I'm not surprised. Anger is the last refuge of the pathetic. Phoenix: (I thought I was more confident than angry...) Judge: Well then, let's see this evidence already. Show to this court evidence that proves where your client was on the night of the crime! Present Ron's Wallet or Key Card Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here's the evidence! Godot: Ha...! It looks like I was right. ...Mr. Trite. The more pathetic a man is, the more likely he is to start pointing fingers! Phoenix: For some reason, the good Prosecutor really wants to prove that I'm \"pathetic\"... Judge: That's because you are pathetic! And so is your \"evidence\"! Phoenix: (Oops. I guess I was wrong... Again.) Ron: Aha! I told you I didn't have an alibi! Leads back to cross-examinationPresent Ron's Wallet or Key Card Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"Ron: I donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Dancingly descended\"...? From where exactly? Ron: Well... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else? Phoenix: (So in actuality, he neither \"danced\" nor \"descended\"! ...Someone save me. Again.) Maya: I guess he thinks \"descended\" sounds more heroic or thief-like or something. Ron: A-Anyway! I was there at the crime scene! Just like I said!Ron: Look! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the photo that was taken by the security camera at the crime scene... Judge: No doubt about it. That's Mask\u2606DeMasque. Phoenix: Yes, but don't forget there's something important missing. The real Mask\u2606DeMasque has a big broach on his chest!Ron: As for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't notice it when your broach was torn off? Ron: Huh!? W-Well... I'm always a little nervous when I'm working. Phoenix: (There's a bit of clothing left on the back side of the broach. I don't think it could have been torn off that easily...) Maya: Yes, but... I don't see what that has to do with anything. Right now we're trying to prove that Mr. DeLite isn't the thief, right? Phoenix: Yeah, I guess so. (Let me hear that testimony one more time.)Maya: Why does Mr. DeLite want to be Mask\u2606DeMasque so badly anyway? It's kinda disturbing. He doesn't seem like your typical attention whore to me. Unlike, say... you, Nick.Phoenix: I am nothing of the sort, thank you very much. (But I gotta admit it is kinda scary the way Ron acts...)Maya: Anyway...

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find which piece of evidence contradicts one of Ron's testimonies in the cross-examination. Let me start by recalling the details from the story and the provided information.\n\nFirst, the characters and evidence. Ron DeLite is claiming to be Mask\u2606DeMasque, but we know from earlier in the story that Luke Atmey was actually revealed as the thief. However, now Ron is testifying that he is the real Mask\u2606DeMasque, and his testimony includes points like having no alibi, wearing the costume, and the broach getting torn off.\n\nLooking at the testimonies listed:\n\nTestimony 2: Ron says, \"I don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\" But wait, there's evidence that might contradict this. Let me check the evidence list.\n\nEvidence 11 is Ron's Wallet, and Evidence 12 is the Key Card. The Key Card's description says it was used on October 12th (the night of the crime) at 1 AM at the KB Security CEO's office. The Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) also shows the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM in the CEO's office. \n\nIf Ron used the Key Card at 1 AM at the KB Security office, then he was there at that time. The crime (the theft of the urn) happened around the same time according to the Camera Data (Evidence 7: camera went off at 1 AM). So, if Ron was using the Key Card at the CEO's office at 1 AM, he couldn't have been at Lordly Tailor stealing the urn at the same time. That would give him an alibi, contradicting his testimony that he has no alibi.\n\nSo, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Ron claiming no alibi) and Evidence 12 (Key Card showing he was elsewhere at the time of the crime). Presenting the Key Card would prove he was at KB Security's office, thus having an alibi, which contradicts his statement about not having one."

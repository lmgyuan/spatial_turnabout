Leads back to: \"Isn't this why the Ringmaster called you into his room that night?\" Max G. Promo Poster Max: Maximillion Galactica! No matter when you see me, you get shivers don't you? The silk hat... The cloak... The white roses on my chest... They're my symbols... You know I had to cut the number of symbols to three? Maya: Really? You had quite a few to begin with then, huh? Max: Well, I thought that you could never have too many symbols... Sunglasses... Beauty mark... Soft pillows for lips... A beard... Buck teeth... I gave all sorts of symbols a shot. But if I forget one when I put on my makeup, everyone would forget who I am! Maya: That's awful... Especially for a magician. Ringmaster's Papers Phoenix: Can I ask what you do with such an exorbitant salary? Max: We've already covered this point. I'm paying off my father's debt. Maya: How could he possibly have such a large amount of debt? Max: For example, say you rented a video... And perhaps you forgot about it, for say... a short period of about 10 years. You'd would* ([sic]) have the biggest late fee known to man... It's kinda like that. Maya: Wow... Now I can see how you can get that much debt. Phoenix: (That makes sense now. Wait a minute... That doesn't make any sense!) Franziska von Karma profile Max: U-Uh-huh... This woman, huh? Well... My type of woman is a gentle sweetie... Maya: Sounds like you are describing Regina! Phoenix: (Well, he's definitely not describing Franziska!) Russell Berry profile Max: Just between you and I... He's* ([sic]) wasn't a bad guy at all. I can say that for sure... Maya: ... That's the first time I've ever heard you say something nice about someone, Max. Phoenix: He must have really been a nice guy. Ben profile Max: I can't believe a guy with that ugly mug is after my sweetie pie princess! Especially after she has eluded my charms for such a long time! Maya: There isn't much you can do about that, right? Max: Hmph. You haven't even been truly in love, have you? Maya: Umm... Max: When you are truly in love with someone... You'd be jealous of their mirror because it traps their image inside. Maya: Awww... Don't you think that's sweet of him, Nick? Max: I'm gonna get back with my sweetie pie! Then I'm gonna turn that dumb puppet into a toy glider! Maya: ...I guess you two haven't worked out your differences yet. After clearing \"\"Shut him up\"\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: December 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance Maya: Huh? Ben's not here anymore! Phoenix: Yeah... I wanted to ask him something. Maya: It's cold out... He's probably in the tent. December 28Berry Big CircusBig Top Maya: What do you think, Nick? I wonder if we've been making any progress... Phoenix: Don't be so negative... Of course we are making progress. Maya: But... Everyone loved the Ringmaster... And there's no sign of footprints on the scene... There's still a lot of mysteries left to be solved. Phoenix: Of course. Maya: And now Regina isn't here! Phoenix: I'm not seeing how that's related... Examine Audience wing Maya: The seats are so far away from the ring... Phoenix: But they make up for it with the amount of people that can see a show. Maya: Hey Nick... Do you think that if every person in the audience screamed all at once, the vibration they'd create could cause the big top to collapse? Phoenix: I'm glad I don't pay you to come up with this stuff... Lion prop Maya: Hey! Look! That's where Max makes his grand appearance! Phoenix: It's \"grand\" alright. Maya: ... I want to try entering court like that. Phoenix: (How'd I know that she'd say that...) Spotlights Maya: Whoa! Those lights are huge! If they fell from the ceiling, you'd be going to the circus in the sky... Life is so fragile, isn't it Nick? Phoenix: It can be snuffed out in an instant by falling gargantuan lights. Maya: It's so fragile that I've decided to eat as much good food as I can before I die. Like hamburgers... Phoenix: Apparently you didn't notice the big sign that said \"closed\" by the snack stand. Maya: Awww... It's closed!? December 28Big TopRingmaster's Room Maya: It looks the same as always... A great big mess. Considering how messy it is, I bet they wouldn't notice if another poster went missing. Phoenix: Will you just stop it, you poster pilferer! Maya: I'm just kidding! You know I already got one of these posters!! Phoenix: You mean \"stole\" one of those posters! Maya: Yeah... Uh... Let's focus on what Max told us. He said that he hid Trilo somewhere in this room. Phoenix: (Trilo... Ohh! The ventriloquist's puppet!) Examine Trophy case Maya: Nick! Look at all the cute trophies!! Phoenix: Indeed. Just look at all the awards this circus has won... Maya: Like... \"All County Quiz Champions\"... \"Ringmaster's Association Mini Golf Master\"... \"Beer Belly Balloon Bounce Champ\"... \"Pet Grooming Grand Prix\"... Wow. The Ringmaster was multi-talented in ways I could have never imagined... Phoenix: Hmm... There's something shoved under the bookshelf! This... is... Maya: That's Trilo! That's Ben's puppet! Phoenix: I think you're right. We'll give it back to him later. Trilo Quist handed over to Maya. Maya: Why do I have to carry this thing!? Detention Center Present Trilo Quist Max: This punk, huh? Trilo is such a wooden, cheeky excuse for a puppet! I can't believe that this thing is what I'm up against for Regina's love! Ahh... My sweetie pie... Love only me... Maya: ...What? You're up against what for Regina's love!? Phoenix: Whatever. Let's hurry up and give this thing back to Ben. December 28Big TopCafeteria Maya: Oh! Hey Ben! Ben: A... Umm... Uhh... H-H-Hello. Maya: Hello to you too! It's awfully cold today don't you agree? Ben: Y-Ye-Ye... Uhh... I-I d-do indeed. Maya: Don't you think it's cold Nick? Phoenix: (I don't see how talking about the weather is helping our case.) Talk What happened Phoenix: Tell us what you know about the murder... Ben: I-I-I-I... Uhhh... I-I-I-I uhhh... Maya: Do you know anything at all? Ben: I d-d-d-don't k-now a-a-a-a t-t-thing! Maya: Well... Ben: W-W-Well... I-I-I-I don't k-k-know... Berry Big Circus Phoenix: You've been in the circus for a long time, haven't you Ben? Ben: Y-Y-Yes... Ab-Ab-About f-f-four years... Maya: I gotta admit, I'm kinda interested in this place as well. Moe is so funny, and Max is so amazing... Not to mention Regina being the cutest little thing I have ever seen! Ben: ...Regina? I... Umm... I... D-D-D-Don't R-R-Really... L-L-L-Like... H-Her... T-T-Too... M-Much... Maya: Hmm... Are you sure about that? Phoenix: (Hmm... That's odd... Max said something about a confession of love...) Present Trilo Quist Leads to: \"Ahh... Ben... This is yours, isn't it?\" Maya: Ahh... Ben... This is yours, isn't it? Ben: Y-Y-Yes!! T-That's mine! Maya: Here ya go! Trilo Quist returned to Ben. Phoenix: Alright Maya... Let's get going! Maya: It's that time isn't it? See ya around, Ben! Ben: O-O-O-OK... Maya: So Nick... Where are we going next? Phoenix: Let's see... Maybe we should go talk to the clown once again. HEY! WAIT!! Maya: Who said that? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT? I'M RIGHT HERE YOU BLIND WENCH! Trilo: What's your problem anyways? Don't you know how to properly greet someone!? Maya: Ben? Is that you Ben? Ben: NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! I would never... Trilo: It was me! Yeah me! Down here!! Phoenix: You... You're... Trilo!? Trilo: That is Mr. Quist to you sir! Learn some manners before you just blurt out my name! Now try speaking to me again, but this time with some proper respect! Phoenix: (Not again... *sigh*) Mr. Quist... Is that better? Trilo: No! Look at me when I am talking to you, you 8-bit excuse for an attorney! Ben: Trilo! We talked about insulting people! You promised!! Trilo: But he was mocking me! Not being mean to bullies was not included in the deal! (Changed from [But he was mocking me! Being mean to bullies was not included in the deal!] in the original release) Ben: I'm sorry, Trilo... Maya: Nick! What just happened? Trilo is still a puppet right? A ventriloquist's puppet! Trilo: Hey! Who do you think you are, calling me a puppet!? Talk What happened Phoenix: Tell us what you know about the murder... Trilo: You talkin' to me? I said you talkin' to me? Don't look at him when you're talkin' to me! Ben: Trilo Quist. You behave young man! Trilo: Shut up Woody! What murder are you talking about? You mean the one where they off'ed the old man? Maya: I guess so... Trilo: No need to make such a fuss about things! That old mutt paid us all peanuts! Ben: Trilo... You can't say things like that! I didn't raise you to be that kind of puppet! Trilo: Don't you have nerve pills or something to take right now? Maya: These two are really an odd couple, aren't they Nick? Trilo: OK! OK! I'll talk... Gramps got clobbered over the head!! Berry Big Circus Trilo: Let me lay it all out for you... The pay sucks... The clown sucks... And my partner has his hand up my pants. Maya: Your partner... You mean Ben? Trilo: Yeah... The creepy old guy who never finds it in himself to leave me alone... Tell him to \"BACK OFF\" for me will ya? He's just another one of the dorks around here! Maya: Oh... My... Trilo: But I'll be fair... In this cesspool of human garbage masquerading as circus performers... I found my Madonna. Maya: Your... Phoenix: Madonna? Trilo: Regina. My lovely Regina. She is stunning... Right? Ben? Ben: Well... I'm not sure if I would go that far... Trilo: You'll have to excuse him... He does not understand of what he speaks. I, on, the other hand, am an appreciator of true beauty. Hence why I shall marry her! Maya: Ma-Ma-Ma-Marry!? Flying Fraud (appears after \"What happened\") Trilo: The Ringmaster got knocked upside his cheap head by that flying fraud!! Phoenix: You mean Max Galactica? Why do you say that? Ben: Trilo! Straighten up!! Don't accuse people like that! Trilo: Straighten up!? I'm made of wood!! Besides, you were there! You know what happened! Phoenix: You were there...? Trilo: Hehe! If you're that interested, then I'll let you in on the facts! Marriage (appears after \"Berry Big Circus\") Maya: You... You're going to marry... Regina? Trilo: That's right! She doesn't quite realize the joy that awaits her, does she? Phoenix: (I think I'm beginning to see why she seemed... troubled...) (Changed from [But she did seem a bit worried about things...] in the original release) Ben: Well... She... Trilo: I don't care! It is my choice not hers! We're getting hitched! Ben: I know you think that... But... Phoenix: (...But what...?) Trilo: I gave her a special gift... I gave her the wonderful gift of song... Maya: You gave her a song? Trilo: Well, I am a renowned tenor! You'll be happy to know that I've decided to grace you with one of my songs! Mi mi mi mi mi mi mi! \"I want you to touch me! I want you to kiss me! I want you to...\" The rest is private! Maya: Well... Umm... The melody is pretty good. Phoenix: But those lyrics... I think they need a little work. Trilo: Who asked you!? I'm the artist here! After clearing all Talk options: Ben: Umm... Uhh... Thanks... Now that Trilo's here... Phoenix: \"Now that Trilo's here...\" Does that mean you can talk normally now? Trilo: Hey! Buttface! Maya: AHHH! Trilo: You must be looking forward to tomorrow, aren't you Mr. Ambulance Chaser!? Phoenix: Uhh... Trilo: You know... It's time to get rid of that pesky magician once and for all!! Maya: Tri... Trilo? Trilo: Enough jibba jabba! Let's get to court already! Phoenix: Ahh... Hey! Wait a second! Maya: Nick... What's going on? Phoenix: He's a witness for tomorrow's trial... Maya: Ahhhhh... December 28Berry Big CircusBig Top Maya: Hmm... What in the world happened with Ben and Trilo? Phoenix: Quite a pair, those two. What did that puppet see anyways? ???: Oooooh! Phoenix: Oh no... Now what!? ???: Oooo-Ooooh! Phoenix: Ahhhhh... Yeowwwwwwwww... Ahhhhhhhhhh... Maya: Hey! Welcome back, Nick! (Changed from [What is it, Nick?] in the original release) Phoenix: T-T-That monkey... ... AHHHH! My badge!! That monkey stole it!! Maya: WHHHAAATTT!? Regina: Hehehehehe! Mr. Attorney, that face was so cute. You looked so completely dumbfounded! Maya: Regina!! Phoenix: You!! That monkey!! Regina: Hey... No need to get angry... OK? Phoenix: B-B-But!! My attorney's badge!! Regina: Don't worry... I'll help you out. Phoenix: OK... If you say so... (If I don't get my badge back, how can I flash it?) Regina: By the way... The monkey's name is Money. Money the monkey. Maya: His name is Monke... Money? Talk Money the Monkey Phoenix: The monkey... Is called Money? Regina: Yes. Phoenix: Well, the rich ape just stole my attorney's badge. Mind if I get that back? Regina: I'll see what I can do... Even I have Money problems. Phoenix: Eh? Regina: Whenever Money sees something shiny, he takes it back home. Maya: Haha... That's pretty funny. Phoenix: Well, I guess I'll just have to find out where Money disappeared to... Regina: I think that's your best bet. You should probably ask Uncle Moe... He might know. Maya: Huh? You don't know? Regina: Well... Money isn't exactly someone I am on friendly terms with. Maya: What!? Regina: He's not really the kind of animal I work with... Even if he does need taming. Maya: Oh, I see! Phoenix: (Go to Moe's... Hmm... I guess it is time that I revisit that kooky clown...) Ben and Trilo Maya: Do you mind telling us a bit about Ben? Regina: Ben...? You mean the guy that is always hanging around with Trilo? Maya: What do you mean \"hanging around\"? Regina: Well, he was there when Trilo told me that he was in love with me... Phoenix: Trilo told you he was in love with you? Regina: Yes he did. Kinda cute, don't ya think? He's so smart, and he's such a wonderful singer... I love him! Maya: But... What about Ben? Regina: What about Ben? He's got nothing to do with me loving Trilo. Phoenix: (Like sand through the hourglass, so are the Days of the Circus...) Proposal Maya: Regina, you were proposed to, weren't you? Regina: Proposed to? Nope... That won't be for a while. Maya: Huh? Really? That's strange, isn't it Nick? Phoenix: Yeah... Max and Trilo both said otherwise. They said they asked for her hand in marriage. Maya: Ahh, but Max only talked to the Ringmaster about it. Phoenix: I forgot about that. He asked the Ringmaster for her hand, not Regina directly. Maya: So I guess Trilo hasn't asked her directly yet. Regina: What!? He's going to propose to me!? I'm so confused... How about you Maya? Maya: Huh? What? Regina: Who do you think I should go for? Max or Trilo? Phoenix: Wait... Wait... You do realize that Trilo is... a... puppet? Regina: Uh? I don't care that he's a bit stiff... Phoenix: Oh boy. Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Take a look at this... Maya: NICK! YOU CAN'T SHOW HER THAT PICTURE!! Phoenix: Ouch... Yeah, that would be a bit insensitive of me. Regina: Huh? Show me! Show me! Show me! Max G. Promo Poster Maya: Do you know how Max flies in the sky like he does? Regina: I do know! Want me to tell ya? Maya: You know!? Regina: Uh-huh. *giggle* But you have to keep it secret! Phoenix: Eh? Regina: So here's how it works... *mumble* *mumble* Maya: Wow! That's incredible!! Phoenix: ... Maya: Oh, don't pout Nick! Regina: Hehe... We were just teasing you! I don't know a thing about magic!! Maya: Sorry we tricked you Nick. After presenting Trilo Quist, then clearing all Talk options in Big Top - Cafeteria: December 28Lodging HousePlaza Maya: Huh? Detective Gumshoe took off already. Phoenix: Yeah... Probably because we ditched him earlier. (Changed from [Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya?] in the original release) I bet he and the other cops got lonely and headed back to the precinct. (Changed from [I'm sure he just got lonely and headed back to the precinct.] in the original release) Examine Tarp Phoenix: Something's covered up by this tarp... An old sign perhaps. Maya: Nick! Look out! They've got the killer trapped behind that tarp! Phoenix: ... Maya: What? It wasn't funny? You know it wouldn't have hurt you to look even a little bit surprised. Phoenix: (Whew! She didn't notice that I was too scared to talk!) Air conditioner Phoenix: This is the condenser for the air conditioner. It hasn't been used in a while. Maya: What!? How'd you figure that out!? You're not making things up now are you!? Phoenix: Hold your horses! It was easy to figure out! It was snowing before the murder, right? Well, look at the condenser. The snow is still piled on top of it. Maya: Wow! Nick! I'm impressed. Maybe you should be a P.I. instead of an attorney. Lightpost Maya: This safety light was on at the time of the murder, wasn't it? Phoenix: That's what they say. (There were performers in the lodging house, so it makes sense that it was on. I bet the killer was worried that someone would spot them during the crime...) Muddy footprints Phoenix: The Ringmaster's body was found here. I heard that the way he fell over made him look like he was carrying a wooden box... But what in the world really happened here? December 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room Moe: Oh my! If it isn't \"Mr. Wright All The Time\"!! Phoenix: *ugh* Moe: It's all Wright to be wrong every now and again, Wright? Maya: See Nick! It just took awhile for the joke to find its audience! Phoenix: ... *sigh* Moe: So what can I do for you? Did you remember a good joke you wanted to tell me? Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it. Maya: We're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we? Moe: How'd you know I put a whopee [sic] cushion on the chair!? You really know what it takes to be a clown, don't you? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Talk Regina Phoenix: So, about Regina... Moe: Regina is such a pure, innocent child... Maya: She's such a cutie, too. Moe: She was born and raised in the circus you know? But that means she doesn't really know much about the world outside the Big Top. Maya: Sounds like Pearly... Moe: For her, every child's \"dream\" of the circus is her everyday reality. Maya: She lives in a dream world... Moe: Everyday she sees dancing wild animals, men flying in the air, and one very funny clown. The funny thing is, that all seems normal to her because it is her everyday life. Phoenix: (I guess that explains why she thinks she can marry a ventriloquist's puppet...) Moe: Don't ask me if her reality is a good thing or a bad thing though... \"A clown sees life simply, without complications.\" Money the Monkey Phoenix: Have you ever heard of a monkey named Money? Moe: Ahhh! Yes! Money! Phoenix: He stole my Attorney's Badge! Moe: Well... Money does love shiny objects... It makes sense that he'd swipe your badge. But under no circumstances can you chase after him. Phoenix: Eh? Why's that? Maya: Oh! I know!! You don't want to get involved in any monkey business, right? Moe: EXACTLY! BRAVO!! BRAVO!! Enough joking around though... Money isn't considered a member of Regina's family. Maya: Then who does he belong to? Moe: I'll be happy to take you to where his owner is staying... Maya: You mean right now? Moe: Of course. Shall we go? Phoenix: (Hmm, should we go with him now, or wait a while?) Go with Moe Leads to: \"December 28 Lodging Hall 3rd Floor Acro's Room\" Go later Phoenix: We'll go after we talk some more, OK? Moe: Yay! You want to hear me talk some more, huh? Your wish is my command!! I'll give ya the full repertoire of 1001 jokes! Maya: Woohoo!! Phoenix: Don't \"Woohoo!!\" that!! Leads back to Talk options December 28Lodging Hall 3rd FloorAcro's Room Phoenix: *huff* *huff* Moe: This is it... What's wrong, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I... can't... breathe... Moe: Don't be such a wimp! You only had to climb two flights of stairs!! Phoenix: *pant* *pant* Moe: Anyways... This is the place. Acro's room. Phoenix: Acro? Moe: He's an acrobat... It seems like he's not around today... Maya: Eh... That's a big pile of junk over in the corner... Moe: I don't think it'd be wrong to assume that Phoenix's stuff is over there too... Just be careful to make sure you've got the Wright stuff. Maya: Thanks Moe! See you later! Money has been added to the Court Record. Acro's Room Examine Window Phoenix: You can see the Big Top from the window here. Maya: There is no snow on top of the Big Top... Kinda weird don't you think? Phoenix: The inside of the tent is warm so any snow that lands on top probably melts. Maya: I guess you're right. The snow probably just slides right off. Tire swing Phoenix: Money must use this to swing around on... Maya: Go ahead Nick. I know you want to ride on it too! Phoenix: Maybe later... Junk pile Leads to: \"Holy cow!\" Basketball hoop Maya: Hey... The net's ripped. Money must be prone to breaking things... He's hardcore. Phoenix: Umm... The net looks fine to me. You really think that he plays basketball? Maya: I think so... Monkeys live life above the rim you know. Phoenix: ... You're joking right? You think the monkey has got proverbial \"game\"? Maya: Of course. That monkey doesn't fake the funk on a nasty dunk. Phoenix: (Well, a prehensile tail might be an unfair advantage...) Calendar Maya: Hehe... It's a monkey calendar! Phoenix: Whoever's in this room must really love monkeys. Maya: Maybe a little too much... Wow... I just realized that the year is almost over. Amazing how time flies. Phoenix: It's been one wild year. Especially the last part... Maya: Well, we still got one last person to help this year... Max. Bed Phoenix: This bed is incredibly well made. It's almost like a maid made it up. Even the laundry on top of the bed is folded perfectly. Maya: Nick, there's nothing unusual about that at all. It's how things are supposed to be! Phoenix: Can't a man respect another man for doing something said man cannot do? Barbell Phoenix: Hmm... He's got a barbell. Look around... Everything he's got is for upper body training. Wait a second... These are the same machines I see on TV all the time! Maya: Hey, Nick! Phoenix: What? Maya: I don't have this one! This barbell here is a new model! Phoenix: Don't overdo it Maya. You don't want to end up a muscle woman. Maya: Holy cow! There's a fork... And a mirror... Everything's shiny!! There's even a really cheap looking knockoff wristwatch! Phoenix: Look at this! It's a trophy! And it's really heavy!! Maya: Nick! I found it! Your badge! It's right here!! Attorney's Badge returned to its rightful spot on lapel. (Changed from [Phoenix's Attorney's Badge has been returned.] in the original release) Phoenix: Thanks! You really saved me! ... Huh? Maya: What's the matter? Did you find something? Phoenix: Yeah. Check this out. Maya: It's a ring... Phoenix: There's something engraved on it... \"From T to R\"... Ring put in pocket. Phoenix: Well... I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation... Maya: Do you think we'll win in court tomorrow? Phoenix: Who knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.) Maya: Don't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!! Phoenix: That's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow... To be continued. Moe's Room (before examining junk pile in Lodging Hall 3rd Floor - Acro's Room) Maya: Huh? Moe must have gone off somewhere... Phoenix: Just as long as he isn't off writing new jokes... Maya: Oh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble. Phoenix: I know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...) Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Turnabout Big Top Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 December 29, 9:43 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5 Max: ... Phoenix: Good morning Max. Max: ... Maya: Max? Max: Mil... Milk... Maya: What? Max: If I don't have a glass of milk before I go on stage... I just can't function sweetie. Maya: St-Stage? Don't worry... There won't be a stage. All you have to do is sit down. Max: I guess... Maya: Nick. Max is really nervous. Phoenix: That's understandable. Max: Hey! My sweeties!! Phoenix: W-What!? Max: You don't think I should fly, do you? Phoenix: Huh? Max: You know... You've got to make a good first impression! When I enter the room, maybe I should fly in and warm up the crowd a little... Phoenix: No no no no no... We can't be having you flying around the courtroom... It just wouldn't be right. Imagine if you hit someone! Maya: Don't worry Max... Just do what Nick says and everything will be OK. Max: Oh sweetie!! Phoenix: What is it this time, Max? Max: Why don't you try flying into the courtroom? Phoenix: ... Max: I can see it now... The dashing young lawyer flying fabulously in from above! One glimpse of that, and everyone in the room will be on your side! Maya: Max... Really... No one needs to fly today. ... Nick? What's with that look in your eyes? Phoenix: (I like the sound of that... \"Dashing young lawyer flying fabulously...\") December 29, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2 Judge: And now the case of one... ............ Phoenix: ............ von Karma: ............ Judge: ............ What!? von Karma: Your Honor! Get on with it! Judge: Oh... Sorry... I just realized that the defendant's name is Billy Bob Johns. Phoenix: So... Judge: Well, isn't the defendant also known as Maximillion Galactica? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor, he does often go by that name. Judge: You know, my grandchild is a huge fan of his. I think everyone here wouldn't mind if we call the defendant Maximillion Galactica... It sounds more... Friendly. Phoenix: (Hmm... I wonder if that is to our advantage?) Judge: Ms. von Karma. Your opening statement if you please. von Karma: ...I hope you didn't bother thinking you'd win this one Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: Eh? von Karma: That spirit channeling trial was a sham! I refuse to acknowledge its legitimacy! It did not count! Do you hear me!? Phoenix: (She must still be upset about what happened last time...) von Karma: You have no chance. Zero. Zilch. Nada. I'm not losing this case! Why, you ask? Because it is not in the nature of a Von Karma to lose at anything!! Maya: I guess being born with the name Von Karma is a free pass to be arrogant and annoying. von Karma: Watch and learn, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I'll show you the textbook procedure for proving how absolutely guilty you are!! Phoenix: M-M-M-Me!? ... Guilty!? What are you talking about!? von Karma: ...It will be my ultimate revenge... Maya: But it's not like it'll bring her dad back... (Changed from [Her dad is gone you know...] in the original release) von Karma: There. Opening statement complete. Now, let's hurry and wrap up this waste of time. (Chagned from [The prosecution is finished. Let's hurry and wrap up this waste of time.] in the original release) Judge: Very well. You may call your first witness Ms. von Karma. (Changed from [You may call your first witness Ms. von Karma.] in the original release) von Karma: Detective Dick Gumshoe! Get up there! NOW!! von Karma: Sorry to keep you from work, as I'm sure you need every penny you can earn, Detective. Gumshoe: Don't mention it! It's no trouble at all! I've been looking forward to this. von Karma: Very well. I would like you to begin by shedding light on the events in question. Gumshoe: At your service, sir. Judge: Alright, Detective. You may proceed with your testimony. Witness Testimony -- Details of the Events -- Gumshoe: The night of the crime, snow was falling until 9:40 PM, making it extremely cold out. All of the circus performers gathered in the Big Top to practice their routines. The practice session broke up around 10 PM. The murder itself took place in the plaza in front of the lodging house at 10:15 PM. The victim was found bent over a wooden box dead as a doornail. The cause of death was blunt force trauma that snapped a vertebrae in his neck. Judge: I see... He was beaten to death. Gumshoe: Here is the autopsy report for the victim. Judge: The court accept [sic] this into evidence. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: A blunt object... Hmm... Very well... Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- Details of the Events -- Gumshoe: The night of the crime, snow was falling until 9:40 PM, making it extremely cold out. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Let me ask you about the snow... Gumshoe: It was nearly a blizzard up until the time of the crime. Phoenix: Did it pile up? Gumshoe: It wasn't such a big deal... Maybe about an inch and a half was on the ground. The snow froze in place and stayed on the ground until the next day. Phoenix: (Hmm... The snow... Let me see... There's got to be more to this...) Maya: Eh? What's the matter? Nick? Phoenix: I need to take a look at the Court Record... Judge: Mr. Gumshoe, what were the members of the circus doing on the night of the crime? Press (after selecting \"About the contents\" upon pressing fifth statement and pressing sixth statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: Let me ask you about the snow... Gumshoe: It was nearly a blizzard up until the time of the crime. Phoenix: Did it pile up? Gumshoe: It wasn't such a big deal... Maybe about an inch and a half was on the ground. The snow froze in place and stayed on the ground until the next day. Phoenix: (Hmm... The snow... Let me see... There's got to be more to this...) Maya: Eh? What's the matter? Nick? Phoenix: I need to take a look at the Court Record... Leads to: \"Well, I think we have a good feel for the details of the event now.\" Gumshoe: All of the circus performers gathered in the Big Top to practice their routines. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: When you say \"all of the circus performers\"... Who do you mean? Gumshoe: Everyone but the dancers and staff were there. Regina the animal tamer, Moe the clown, Ben the Ventriloquist... And of course, the defendant, Maximillion Galactica, and his victim, the Ringmaster. Oh, I almost forgot... Regent the tiger was there as well. Phoenix: Out of curiosity, what about the circus monkey? Gumshoe: When I was investigating yesterday, he happened to snatch my wristwatch. Judge: Detective, you are welcome to file a police report AFTER these proceedings! Gumshoe: The practice session broke up around 10 PM. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: After the practice was over, where did everyone head off to...? Gumshoe: Regina was playing with Regent, while Moe went back to his room tired from work... Ben the ventriloquist went to the front gate absorbed in his own world... The Ringmaster and Max went off to the Ringmaster's room to talk privately. Judge: Talk privately, huh? That's awfully suspicious... You wouldn't happen to know what they were talking about would you? Gumshoe: It seems they were negotiating Max's salary... Phoenix: (Actually, Max was asking for Regina's hand in marriage!) Gumshoe: The murder itself took place in the plaza in front of the lodging house at 10:15 PM. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I'd like you to be a bit more specific about the events at 10:15 PM. Gumshoe: Uh... Umm... OK... Not a problem, pal. We've got a witness that told us how the whole thing went down. OWWW!! von Karma: This is totally meaningless. Time to move on! Judge: Hmm... Alright... We'll just have to revisit that testimony later. Detective Gumshoe, would you mind telling us how the victim met his end? Gumshoe: The victim was found bent over a wooden box dead as a doornail. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A \"wooden box\"? Gumshoe: That's right. The victim must have been carrying the wooden box when he was killed. Judge: Carrying the box, huh? Gumshoe: It was a rather strange wooden box, Your Honor. Judge: What do you mean? Gumshoe: Well... It was much heavier than it looked... Not to mention it was locked. Judge: Locked, you say? Wooden Box added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (This may be my only chance, so I might as well ask some questions...) About the Wooden Box Phoenix: This wooden box... You figure it weighs about 20 pounds, right? Gumshoe: Sounds about right. The whole thing is lined with iron. Phoenix: Iron plating? Why do you think it's lined with iron? Gumshoe: I figure they just did it to make the box heavier... Yeowch!! von Karma: I think we could all do without your guesses, Detective. Stick to what little you actually know! Gumshoe: S-S-Sorry... Suffice it to say, the box is really heavy. von Karma: Much better. You may continue on, Detective. Leads back to cross-examination About the lock Phoenix: You said the box was locked. How exactly was it locked? Gumshoe: Well... It had quite a sturdy lock on it. It took quite a bit to open that bad boy up. Phoenix: So, when you found the box, it was locked, correct? Gumshoe: Yes, it was. Some of the forensics team took it back to the precinct to crack it open. Judge: I see... Continue Detective Gumshoe. Leads back to cross-examination About the contents Phoenix: Do you mind telling us what was inside that box? Gumshoe: Well, when we found the box, it was locked tighter than Fort Knox. So we took it back to the station and cracked it open. All that was inside was this little bottle... Judge: Bottle? What is that, Detective? Gumshoe: Exactly what it looks like Your Honor. It's a condiment bottle. Phoenix: What's inside the bottle? Gumshoe: It's filled with... pepper. Judge: Pepper...? Why in the world was it locked in that big box? Phoenix: (There was only one little bottle in that huge box...?) Maya: I wonder if that has some sort of special meaning? Small Seasoning Bottle added to the Court Record. Leads back to cross-examination Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: A \"wooden box\"? Gumshoe: That's right. The victim must have been carrying the wooden box when he was killed. Judge: Carrying the box, huh? Gumshoe: It was a rather strange wooden box, Your Honor. Judge: What do you mean? Gumshoe: Well... It was much heavier than it looked... Not to mention it was locked. Judge: Locked, you say? Phoenix: (This may be my only chance, so I might as well ask some questions...) About the Wooden Box Phoenix: This wooden box... You figure it weighs about 20 pounds, right?

Phoenix: (There was only one little bottle in that huge box...?) Maya: I wonder if that has some sort of special meaning? Leads back to cross-examination Gumshoe: The cause of death was blunt force trauma that snapped a vertebrae in his neck. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: According to the Autopsy Report, the murder weapon was a blunt object, correct? Gumshoe: You've done your homework, pal. Phoenix: And you haven't found this murder weapon, have you? von Karma: The police are searching for it as we speak. Gumshoe: My theory is that it is something the perpetrator ran off with. Judge: You would think so... Especially since you didn't find it on the scene. Gumshoe: No no no... I bet he made it disappear with magic... Ho ho ho! Maya: There wasn't much that we could go after Gumshoe with this time... Phoenix: He gave us the facts, as he saw them. But there's gotta be more to this. Maya: I didn't see anything... But that's why you're the lawyer and I'm the medium. After pressing first and sixth statements and selecting \"About the contents\" upon pressing fifth statement: Judge: Well, I think we have a good feel for the details of the event now. Phoenix: (I guess that's all we're gonna get out of Gumshoe in this case...) Maya: You mean all we're gonna get out of him is that little bottle of pepper? von Karma: Now that we have wrapped up with the Detective, I'd like to call my next witness. Gumshoe: Eh? I'm not even off the stand yet! von Karma: Obviously... But that's due to you being slow and unable to take a hint! Gumshoe: I dunno, but \"wrapped up\" has such a mean sound to it... I'm a sensitive guy... Judge: Thank you very much, Detective Gumshoe. You may step down. Ms. von Karma. Call your next witness. von Karma: I would like to call Mr. Benjamin Woodman to the stand. Phoenix: (She must be talking about Ben the ventriloquist...) Maya: I wonder if Trilo will show up on the stand as well...? von Karma: Please state your name and occupation for the record. Trilo: My full name is Trilo Quist. I am employed as an opera tenor. Judge: Ex-Excuse me! The witness called to the stand was one Mr. Benjamin Woodman, Ventriloquist. Trilo: That robe must be cutting off your circulation. I said that I was a singer!! Maybe you don't believe me. Fine. I'll grace you with a song. *Ahem*... Mi mi mi mi mi! The world of the law... Exciting and daring... Guilt or innocence... Decided by a judge dressed up like a woman!! ...Well, what do you think? von Karma: ... Judge: ... Maya: It had a good rhythm... Phoenix: It's just the lyrics... They leave something to be desired, so to speak. Ben: T-Trilo! You know better than to insult a judge!! Trilo: Shuddup! Just look at your nose. You would think you'd have the sense to fix it!! It's so ugly I want to punch you in the face on the off change swelling would help. You know that your nose is the reason you'll never be an A-List star. Maya: Celebrities must really enjoy saying everything that flashes into their minds. Judge: What's going on here!? Order! Order! I demand to know who the witness is!! Ben: Don't... Don't worry about me, sir. I'll let Trilo handle this. Judge: I'm not worried about you one bit... I'm worried about getting testimony in my court! OUCH!! von Karma: You won't get anywhere trying to figure out this witness! Now let's proceed! Witness Testimony -- What You Witnessed -- Trilo: Once practice was over, I left the tent with the stooge... I mean clown. Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went back to the plaza's entrance. (Changed from [Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went over to the plaza.] in the original release) That's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime. He was the only one heading that way... How could that punk not be the killer!? Then the police showed up, and took magic boy away. von Karma: You saw Maximillion Galactica heading towards the scene? You're sure of that? Trilo: Without a doubt. He had on his silk hat, cloak, and the dumb white roses on his chest. How can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high... Judge: Th-That's enough... I think we all get the picture. Just one thing... You said you \"ditched\" the clown. Trilo: That's right, dress-boy. Judge: Well, since you weren't with him, couldn't that mean the clown committed the crime? Phoenix: (Hmm... He's got a point.) von Karma: What a shame... It was a nice theory, but the clown can't be the criminal. Judge: Why's that? von Karma: Here's absolute proof. Judge: A... silk hat? von Karma: This was found at the scene of the crime. It belongs to the defendant. Phoenix: Ah... von Karma: Without question, he was wearing his signature hat during practice. If the clown was the murderer, there would be no reason for this hat to be at the scene. Judge: Hmm... Well done, Ms. von Karma. Your prosecutorial skills are unrivaled. Well done. von Karma: Thank you for stating the obvious... Mr. Phoenix Wright, what do you have to say? Phoenix: O-OK... (I guess she's the boss again today...) Cross Examination -- What You Witnessed -- Trilo: Once practice was over, I left the tent with the stooge... I mean clown. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The clown... You're talking about Moe? Trilo: Of course I'm talking about that old fart. He's so pathetic, I can't stand him! Just a little bit of exercise and his makeup is running all over the place... Once practice was over, he was 9/10ths of the way to keeling over for good... Phoenix: Poor guy... Trilo: We didn't have any choice, so Ben took him back to his room. When it comes to being a first place loser, that guy's ahead of the pack! Judge: Hmm... Then what happened? Trilo: Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went back to the plaza's entrance. (Changed from [Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went over to the plaza.] in the original release) Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What did you do then? Trilo: I went over to the Plaza to do some thinking. Phoenix: It was awfully cold out that night... Especially with all the snow around... Wouldn't thinking in your nice warm lodging house have been a better idea? von Karma: von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright. I think you should leave the thinking to the witness. Phoenix: (But I'm a good thunker* ([sic])! At least my teachers always said I was...) Trilo: That's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was really Max Galactica? Trilo: Of course I'm sure. How could you mistake someone wearing such a snobby 3 piece get-up! Phoenix: Snobby 3 piece get-up? Trilo: Get the wax out of your ears! Lawyers nowadays... You're like talking to a brick wall! Max's 3 piece get-up! Jeez! Could you be any more dense! All together now! \"SILK HAT! CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\" Trilo: Thank you! Maya: Nick, I think you should put a little bit more effort into preparing your questions... Trilo: He was the only one heading that way... How could that punk not be the killer!? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw Max and only Max, right Trilo? Trilo: That's right. And that makes him the killer! There was only one person headed that way that night. Judge: Hmm... That makes quite a bit of sense and makes Max one suspicious character... Phoenix: (There's more to this story than meets the eye... Is there something amiss in this?) No problems. Phoenix: (I can't really see anything wrong with what Ben... I mean Trilo said.) Maya: Maybe you should take a step back and look things over again, Nick. Leads back to cross-examination There is no proof it was Max. Phoenix: Wait a second! There's no proof that the witness saw Maximillion Galactica... Trilo: Hey! Hey! You still don't get it, do ya? I saw what I saw... It was Max's 3 piece joke of a costume! Alright! Lets [sic] say it all together now! \"SILK HAT! CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\" Trilo: Thank you! Judge: I think you should study up on your celebrities, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Great, I'm getting shut down by a toy!) Leads back to cross-examination Ben only saw Max? Phoenix: That's a bit strange, don't you think? Trilo: What's strange!? Phoenix: That you only saw Max... Doesn't it seem like you should have seen someone else as well? Judge: What? Where are you going with this, Mr. Wright? Who else do you suppose this witness could have seen? Present Russell Berry profile (before correctly presenting Regina Berry profile upon pressing fifth statement) Phoenix: Judge: That's the... victim... Phoenix: That's correct. If Trilo was at the entrance to the plaza... He should have seen the Ringmaster as well! Ah-hah! von Karma: Obviously the Ringmaster arrived at the scene of the crime before the witness could have seen him! Anyone with sense could have figured that one out! Phoenix: What are you talking about!? The Ringmaster and Max went together to the Ringmaster's room! von Karma: Is that according to the defendant? A likely story! If Maximillion Galactica was supposed to be in the Ringmaster's room, why was he, just as the witness stated... At the scene of the crime!? Phoenix: Ahh!! Judge: I see... It seems that at this stage I have no reason to doubt this witness's testimony. And there are clearly no conclusive contradictions. Phoenix: He's right... von Karma: A brilliant judgment, Your Honor. Now, let's move along with the testimony! Leads back to cross-examination Present Russell Berry profile (after correctly presenting Regina Berry profile upon pressing fifth statement) Phoenix: Judge: That's the... victim... Phoenix: That's correct. If Trilo was at the entrance to the plaza... He should have seen the Ringmaster as well! Ah-hah! von Karma: Obviously the Ringmaster arrived at the scene of the crime before the witness could have seen him! Anyone with sense could have figured that one out! Phoenix: What are you talking about!? The Ringmaster and Max went together to the Ringmaster's room! von Karma: Is that according to the defendant? A likely story! If Maximillion Galactica was supposed to be in the Ringmaster's room, why was he, just as the witness stated... At the scene of the crime!? Phoenix: Ahh!! Judge: I see... Leads to: \"Alright!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Trilo: ... Ben: ... Trilo: Don't hold your tongue Ben! It's your job to answer all the stupid questions. Ben: I'm sorry Trilo... Phoenix: (I've gotta find a way to get more information out of this witness...) Maya: Think about it some more Nick! I'm sure you'll come up with something!! Leads back to cross-examination Press (after correctly presenting Russell Berry profile) Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw Max and only Max that night? Trilo: Jeez, you're persistent. You can ask all you want, my answer won't change! The only person I saw that night was Maximillion Galactica! Phoenix: (He really needs to improve his manners...) von Karma: You've heard what he has to say. Let him continue with his testimony! Trilo: Then the police showed up, and took magic boy away. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Around what time did the police arrive at the scene? Trilo: Hmm... I suppose that would have been around... Hey, what time was it!? Ben: Huh!? Umm... I think it was around... I'd say a bit after 10:30 PM... I think... Phoenix: Practice ended at 10 PM so you hung around the lodging house the entire time? Ben: I... I... I... I guess that sounds about right... Phoenix: Wasn't it awfully cold? I can't believe you'd just stand outside in that weather! Ben: Well... Uh... The truth is... Trilo: Will you shut up, you big nosed dope! Why are you telling him anything extra!? Why can't you believe that we'd just stand outside in that weather? Phoenix: Well, maybe you were waiting for someone? Trilo: W-W-W-W-WHAT!? WHO SAID WE WERE WAITING FOR SOMEONE!? von Karma: von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright! We can all do without your off-handed theories! Phoenix: Phoenix: But! This witness! He's cracking under the pressure already! I'm on to something! Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright! Who do you suppose the witness was waiting for out in the cold that night? Present Regina Berry profile (before correctly presenting Russell Berry profile upon pressing fourth statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, if he was waiting outside in the cold, it was for one person... And one person only! He was waiting for the animal tamer, Regina! Trilo: WAAAAHHHH!! Phoenix: You were waiting outside for Regina to come back to the lodging house. Am I mistaken? Trilo: ... Judge: Is this true? Ben: Well... I... Umm... You can't really ask me that question... Trilo: Who cares who I was waiting for that night! What's important is what I saw! Don't you forget it!! Judge: Well well well... The puppet may be a bit stiff, but he's right. Phoenix: Eh... Judge: It seems that at this stage I have no reason to doubt this witness's testimony. And there are clearly no conclusive contradictions. Phoenix: He's right... von Karma: A brilliant judgment, Your Honor. Now, let's move along with the testimony! Leads back to cross-examination Present Regina Berry profile (after correctly presenting Russell Berry profile upon pressing fourth statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, if he was waiting outside in the cold, it was for one person... And one person only! He was waiting for the animal tamer, Regina! Trilo: WAAAAHHHH!! Phoenix: You were waiting outside for Regina to come back to the lodging house. Am I mistaken? Trilo: ... Judge: Is this true? Ben: Well... I... Umm... You can't really ask me that question... Trilo: Who cares who I was waiting for that night! What's important is what I saw! Don't you forget it!! Judge: Well well well... The puppet may be a bit stiff, but he's right. Phoenix: Eh... Leads to: \"Alright!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Trilo: ... Ben: ... Trilo: Don't hold your tongue Ben! It's your job to answer all the stupid questions. Ben: I'm sorry Trilo... Phoenix: (I've gotta find a way to get more information out of this witness...) Maya: Think about it some more Nick! I'm sure you'll come up with something!! Leads back to cross-examination Press (after correctly presenting Regina Berry profile) Phoenix: Phoenix: What time did the police arrive on the scene would you say? Trilo: They could have shown up at any time and nothing would change... A little after 10:30 PM... There's not a doubt in my mind! Phoenix: (It doesn't look like he is lying about this...) Maya: Hmm... Trilo wouldn't happen to have an ulterior motive for incriminating Max, would he? Phoenix: Well, Max is part of that bitter love triangle with Regina. Which is probably why Max conked him over the head. Maya: Umm Nick... Wasn't Ben the one who got knocked over the head? Phoenix: Uh... Yeah... I think so... I dunno anymore! Phoenix: Alright! There is obviously a reason why this witness was there that night! He spent all that time waiting for Regina to arrive! Moreover... Even if someone else would've walked right in front of him, I doubt he would have paid them a second thought! Trilo: AHHHH!! Judge: That makes perfect sense. von Karma: von Karma: What did you just say!? The witness saw the defendant at the scene of the crime!! Phoenix: Phoenix: However, he did not see the victim on the way to his eventual demise! If you accept that, then you must accept that there is a high likelihood that... He could have missed someone else other than Max heading to the scene! OWWW!! von Karma: There is absolutely no proof that the witness was waiting for the animal tamer! Trilo: Umm... Umm... I guess you got me... Alright! Alright! I'll spill the beans for real this time! It's true. I was waiting for Regina. Ben: PAIN!! von Karma: Don't volunteer things!! Judge: Mr. Quist, tell us the truth this time... And I mean the whole truth! Were you or were you not waiting for Regina at the entrance to the lodging house? Trilo: I was! I was waiting to propose to her!! Judge: You were what!? Waiting to... propose!? Trilo: What's the matter!? You think that humans have a monopoly on marriage!? Judge: That... The matter of puppet marriage is not under review in this case! Trilo: You're the judge! I mean, look at your horrible outfit!! Ben: MORE PAIN!! von Karma: Hmph. Thanks to your bumbling, my perfect plan is not so perfect anymore! Now we have to waste time getting to the bottom of some silly proposal by a puppet!! Witness Testimony -- About the Proposal -- Trilo: Don't be so surprised that I was going to propose to Regina! I even had something to give to her... I kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her. Of course, I also had it in my pocket that night. It was a present for her. In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket! Judge: You were going to propose... You... A puppet... Trilo: Don't be so obtuse! Just because I'm a puppet doesn't mean I can't love! Judge: I guess you're right... Just because I'm old doesn't mean I couldn't propose to her too! Trilo: Exactly! Phoenix: (His Honor is looking a little less than honorable right now...) Judge: OK, Mr. Wright... Please continue with your examination... *sigh* Maya: What was with that sigh at the end... (Changed from [Aww... Did you hear that? His sigh seemed a little wistful.] in the original release) Cross Examination -- About the Proposal -- Trilo: Don't be so surprised that I was going to propose to Regina! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: By proposal, you mean proposing marriage, correct? To Regina. Trilo: Of course that's what I meant! What kinda stupid question is that!? I wasn't going to propose that we become sort of outlaw biker gang together!! Right, Ben!? Ben: Ye-Yeah... Trilo: Got it!? That's the truth! Trilo: I even had something to give to her... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What was it exactly that you planned on giving her? Trilo: You know exactly what I was going to give her, numbskull! The only thing I could find that could match Regina's beauty! von Karma: Answer his question! What was it!? Trilo: You're gonna die when you hear this... It's an engagement ring!! von Karma: Engagement (Changed from [An] in the original release) Judge: Engagement ring!?!? (Changed from [An Engagement Ring!?!?] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wow... Those two nearly fell out of their chairs!) von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright's joke has gone too far! Time for this to end right here! Phoenix: (Franziska's whip looks like it's about to lash out at almost anything... One hit from that thing will probably shut someone up for a long time...) Pain equals bad Phoenix: (I think I'm gonna live to fight another day and shut up now...) Maya: Nick! Don't be such a coward! Leads back to cross-examination Push on anyway Phoenix: It may be something of a joke, but this is a historic moment! The first time that a puppet has ever proposed to a human being... OWWW!! von Karma: I advise you to cut this argument short... Judge: I'm going to have to agree with the defense here. Will the witness please revise their testimony... Specifically about the engagement ring... I'd like to stick to facts, not sociology. Trilo: You sure do enjoy sweating the details, especially for a man in a black bath robe... Changes statement from \"I even had something to give to her...\" to \"I planned on giving an engagement ring to Regina...\" Trilo: I planned on giving an engagement ring to Regina... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: An engagement ring...? Trilo: Uh huh! It's actually a diamond shaped stone cut from glass! Even more brilliant than the real thing! I think Regina is going to love it! Phoenix: (It's just a ring...) Maya: What's the matter, Nick? Phoenix: Well... There's got to be something I can catch him on... Trilo: I kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who's pocket was the ring in? Trilo: Mine of course! What a stupid question!! You've got to be kidding me! You think Ben could pull that off!? Ben: I-I'm s-s-sorry... R-R-Really... Trilo: You don't have to apologize for that!! He's the one who should be apologizing!! Phoenix: (Really?) Present Ring (after changing second statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Trilo, do you mind if I show you something?\" Trilo: Of course, I also had it in my pocket that night. It was a present for her. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you went to the lodging house to give it to her? Trilo: That's right! I tried to give it to her during practice so many times that I lost count, but... That uppity snob kept getting in the way! Max: Uppity snob!? He couldn't possibly be talking about me... Maximillion Galactica! When I get a hold of him, I'm gonna saw his wood block in half... And not with magic!! Judge: ... Phoenix: Well... They always say that love creates rivalries. Judge: So what about this present? Present Ring (after changing second statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Trilo, do you mind if I show you something?\" Trilo: In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you are still thinking of trying to give it to Regina...? Trilo: Of course I am! I spent three months salary on this thing! I'm not gonna give up that easily! Maya: Hmm, I wonder how much he receives for appearing in the circus? Phoenix: Probably way more than he deserves. Present Ring (after changing second statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Trilo, do you mind if I show you something?\" Maya: How about it Nick? Phoenix: I think it's time to unwrap this toy's testimony. Maya: That's the spirit Nick! Give him heck! Phoenix: (The judge has that dazed and confused look again. Maybe he should get out more.) (Changed from [Uh oh, the judge has that dazed look again. Maybe he should get out more.] in the original release) Phoenix: Trilo, do you mind if I show you something? Ben: What is it? Trilo: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: (Uh oh... Looks like they're going to double team me now...) Do you recognize this ring? Trilo: Ah! That's... That's... That's mine!! Give it back! Thief! Thief! Phoenix: Didn't you just testify about this very object? I believe you said... \"In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!\" Why then, do I have it right here...? Trilo: AAAAAAAAAARRRRRGHHHHH!! Judge: What is going on here!? Trilo: That's... That's... Ben! Say something!! Ben: Eh? Don't put me on the spot like that Trilo!! Phoenix: I found this in Money's room... Judge: M-M-Money's room? You mean a room they put money, like a bank vault? Trilo: Hah! That filthy monkey is gonna get what's coming to him!! Judge: Mr. Quist, I would prefer if you avoided slandering innocent fiats in my court. Phoenix: Well, Your Honor... Money really is a monkey... In every sense of the word. Judge: Ah. I see... Well then... Phoenix: Money likes to go after the shiniest things that he can find and gather them up. Judge: Shiny... Things? Phoenix: Trilo! When was this ring stolen from you? Ben: Well... I suppose it was... That time... You know... That night... The night of the crime... von Karma: What did you just say!? Phoenix: Details... I need more details... Ben: Well... It was stolen right after Max showed up in the plaza... Phoenix: Right about when you saw the defendant walk past, correct? Ben: Well... Umm... I guess you... Might... Umm... Be able to say that... The ring might have... Well... It could have been... Taken around that time... ???: Oooo-Ooooh! Ben: Ahhhhh... Yeowwwwwwwww... Ohhhhhhhhhh... Trilo: Ben! What's with you!? ... Oh, whatever... It has nothing to do with anything! Especially not who committed the murder!! Phoenix: It's not for you to decide what has to do with what! Now, Trilo! Back to the topic at hand! Trilo: I haven't admitted a thing! Not I... Mr. Trilo Quist! Phoenix: What did you do when the ring was taken, Trilo? Trilo: You know exactly what I did! I chased after that ring snatching monkey Money!! Phoenix: But you weren't able to catch up with him, were you? Trilo: It's all this slow loafy fool called Ben's fault! While he was fumbling his way through the snow, that dumb monkey was able to get away! Judge: That is indeed an incredible shame. Phoenix: Well... This does indeed prove one very important point. von Karma: Prove an important point!? What point could that possibly be? Ben doesn't exercise enough. Phoenix: Obviously that one Mr. Benjamin Woodman is lacking in the area of exercise!! Judge: ... von Karma: ... Trilo: ... Phoenix: This is clear from the testimony we have just listened to!! He was too slow and awkward to catch a monkey fleeing through the snow!!! (This revelation doesn't seem to be registering too well around the courtroom...) Maya: Maybe you should leave the courtroom drama for video games and rethink that one... Phoenix: Umm... OK. Leads back to: \"Well... This does indeed prove one very important point.\" Ben's testimony has a flaw. Leads to: \"There is a huge contradiction in this witness's testimony!\" Phoenix: There is a huge contradiction in this witness's testimony! von Karma: Co-Contradiction!? Phoenix: The witness just testified to the following effect -- Up until the police arrived, he didn't move from the entrance to the plaza. HOWEVER! The witness just stated that he chased after Money the monkey. When the witness was off chasing Money, there was no one watching the plaza! von Karma: What is the meaning of all this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where are you going with this little theory of yours? Phoenix: I'm saying that there is no possible way that this witness saw the plaza the entire time! That's where I'm going with this little theory! Which leads me to my next point. It is entirely possible that someone other than the defendant was at the scene! Judge: Interesting, Mr. Wright. von Karma: von Karma: Well then tell me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Do you have any proof that something slipped past this vigilant ventriloquist? Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, he obviously didn't see the victim, the Ringmaster, arrive on the scene! von Karma: However, that doesn't change the fact that he saw the defendant arrive! Phoenix: The witness is lying! He is blinded by his rivalry with Max! Judge: Well... The defense's argument does hold water. This witness does have a history of animosity towards the defendant. Trilo: What!? How dare you!? I wouldn't lie just to get that dorkface in trouble! He's not even worth it!! I saw him! No doubt about it! I saw that worthless liar! Judge: Well... Just for clarity's sake, let's flesh out exactly who you saw on that night. Trilo: Hah! I've told you so many times, you'd think you'd know my story's not changing! Phoenix: (You've already changed your story, stick boy! And I'm sure it will change some more.) Maya: Where there is one lie, there are usually many more behind it. Phoenix: Exactly, Maya. That's why we have to keep after him! Maya: Yeah! Witness Testimony -- Witnessing Max -- Trilo: I'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina. But that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night! He showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes. I said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence! I'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!! There's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols! Judge: Hmm... von Karma: So that means that Money didn't show up until after you saw Max? Trilo: That's right. Money ran up less than a minute after I saw Max. Phoenix: Then Money snatched the ring, and you went chasing after him? Judge: How long was it until you came back to where you were waiting? Trilo: Well. Let's see... I'd say about... Ben: I suppose five minutes. I think... von Karma: So the victim could have arrived on the scene in that five minute stretch. Judge: Mr. Wright, please proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Witnessing Max -- Trilo: I'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were only concerned with waiting for Regina that night?  That means you probably wouldn't have noticed if someone else showed up. Trilo: You should think about how many eyes I actually have. I've got four, you know! Four. F-O-U-R. Counting Ben of course... With that many eyes, do you really think something would have slipped by me? Judge: Four eyes is an awful lot of attention directed at one area, I suppose... Phoenix: (Yikes! The judge is even more dangerous to our case than Trilo!) Trilo: But that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw Max coming out of the Big Top that night? Trilo: Of course that's where I saw him coming from! I was staring at the entrance to the tent the entire time! Phoenix: (I guess that makes sense, especially since he was waiting for Regina.) Trilo: He showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: About what time would you say these events took place? Trilo: You're one of the dumbest people on the planet if you can't figure it out yourself! You already know that practice finished promptly at 10 PM! And you already know that I went to the lodging house right after practice! You don't need to be a brain surgeon to know around what time it was when I saw him... Just add ten more minutes! I'm sure you can do that! Now what time was it? Judge: Indeed, what time was it? Phoenix: Hmm... What time was it? Lemme think about that for a second......... ...YEOW!! I'm no good at math! von Karma: *sigh* It was 10:10 PM! Judge: Ahhh, yes. That sounds about right! Trilo: It sounds about right because that's the time that I saw Max on the scene! Trilo: I said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you testified that you said \"good evening\" to Max that night. Trilo: You must enjoy asking incredibly obvious questions! You say \"good morning\" in the morning, and \"good afternoon\" during the day, right? And it's obvious that I'd say \"good night\" to someone at night!! Ben: ... Trilo: What Ben!? You've got something to add!? Lemme guess... \"That's not it Trilo! You say 'good evening' at night!\" Ben: Ah... I'm sorry Trilo... Judge: Mr. Quist, I would prefer if you kept your ventriloquist's act outside of the courtroom! Trilo: Impossible! A performer lives and breathes his performances! You should know better!! Phoenix: (There's got to be something wrong with this bit of testimony...) Nothing especially Phoenix: (I guess it's kinda petty to bad mouth someone's performances...) Maya: I think so too... I guess you really are \"Wright all the time!\" Phoenix: Glad to see you finally coming around to that. Judge: Continue with the cross-examination please! Leads back to cross-examination Trilo's evening greeting Phoenix: Isn't that a bit strange to you? Trilo: What do you mean? Phoenix: Well, if you hate Max so much, why would you bother being nice to him? It strikes me as somewhat strange. Trilo: Why would it strike you as strange? von Karma: Exactly! How is it strange to be cordial to one of your coworkers? Phoenix: Well... If it was simply just being cordial to a coworker I would understand... OWW!! That hurt!! von Karma: Maybe you should think of having some proof before your lips start flapping next time! Proof is everything in this world! You should have learned that back in grade school!! Phoenix: (There's no reason that Trilo would ever say something nice to Max... But how do I go about proving that with the evidence?) Maya: Bluffing is everything in this world! ...But I'm sure you already learned that one!! Phoenix: I guess I can give it a shot... Judge: The witness will resume his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Ben's half of the comedy act Phoenix: I hate to say it, but Ben's part of your little act is coming off a bit stale! I'm sure that if a pro was to review your work, he would say... OWWW!! von Karma: You're not trying to pass yourself off as a professional performer, are you? Don't get so wrapped up in yourself, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You! Should know! Better! Phoenix: OW! OWWW! AWWWWWW! THAT HURTS!! von Karma: That should have set him straight! You may proceed with your testimony, Witness. Leads back to cross-examination Present Broken Bottle or Regina Berry profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Trilo, is it not true that you had a fight with Max on the day of the murder?\" Trilo: I'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You are 100% absolutely sure of what you just said? Trilo: I told you already! Jeez!! I am 100% absolutely sure! von Karma: There's no way that he could be any more confident than that, right? Trilo: There's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Those three ridiculous symbols, huh? Trilo: Out of curiosity, exactly how many times have you asked that question by now? If you're gonna ask again, I'll answer with a chorus... Everyone together now! Judge: \"SILK HAT! Maya: CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\" Trilo: Thank you very much! Phoenix: Maya... You didn't have to join in did you!? Maya: But... It's fun shouting out with everyone else!! Maya: There has to be a hole in his testimony somewhere. Phoenix: I agree. But do we have the proof to make something stick? Maya: All we can do is try, right Nick!? We've gotta have something that will prove useful. Phoenix: All right, time to go to work. Phoenix: Trilo, is it not true that you had a fight with Max on the day of the murder? von Karma: A fight? Phoenix: A fight over Regina to be exact. Trilo: It wasn't that big of a deal! It was just an argument... A disagreement at most! Phoenix: A disagreement usually doesn't end with someone getting clonked over the head... Trilo: AHHHH!! Phoenix: That morning, Ben got clobbered over the head by Max, didn't he? Judge: Wh-What? Is that an admission of assault and battery? OUCH!! von Karma: Before we handle that, we should wrap up the defendant's murder charge first! Phoenix: The truth is that on the day of the crime, the defendant and witness had a huge fight! There is absolutely no way they would have suddenly become cordial that evening! Moreover, just consider the personality of the witness on stand! There is no way a puppet this lewd would just up and say \"good evening\" to his rival! Trilo: GWWAAAAHHHH!! von Karma: von Karma: Are you saying this witness is lying!? That he is trying to frame the defendant by claiming to have seen him at the crime scene!? Trilo: I-I-I... I didn't tell a single lie! Honestly! I just... Judge: That's enough from you Mr. Quist! Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Judge: Let's clarify this testimony for the court... Could you explain your theory about who the witness actually saw that night? He didn't see anyone. Phoenix: Of course, the witness did not see a soul that night. Judge: I see... Trilo: Who... Who do you think you are to just up and decide what it is I saw that night!? von Karma: A fool can only understand a foolish foolery uttered by the most foolish of fools. The witness \"didn't see anyone\"... You wouldn't happen to have proof to back up that statement, would you? Phoenix: *gulp* Maya: Nick, I just thought of something... If Ben and Trilo really didn't see anyone that night, they wouldn't have testified that they greeted someone that night, would they? Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean? Maya: I think that Trilo really did say \"good evening\" to someone that night. Phoenix: But... Trilo and Max... They were in the middle of a huge fight. Judge: Maybe you should think this over some more on your own time, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"Let's clarify this testimony for the court...\" He saw the defendant. Phoenix: Of course he saw the defendant! How could he miss Maximillion Galactica!? OWWWW!! von Karma: You said that Trilo would have no reason to greet Max if they had met that night! You said that, did you not!? Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Phoenix: Ahh... von Karma: \"Ahh...\" is not the correct answer! Judge: Mr. Wright! I'm afraid that \"Ahh\" has just landed the defense a penalty! Phoenix: (Foiled again...) Maya: Nick, you've got to think about things a bit more and give it another shot! Phoenix: Yeah, I know... (And by the looks of things I've gotta hurry up!) Leads back to: \"Let's clarify this testimony for the court...\" He saw a different person. Leads to: \"It is my belief that the witness did indeed see someone that night...\" Phoenix: It is my belief that the witness did indeed see someone that night... It was just someone else! That's who he said \"good evening\" to. von Karma: What kind of theory is that!? Phoenix: The correct one. Furthermore, I don't believe the person the witness saw was Max at all. von Karma: Wh-What!? Phoenix: If he had truly met Max that night, there would have been no greeting at all. Which means there is only one proper answer. The person the witness saw that night was not Maximillion Galactica. That is why Trilo made the effort to greet whoever it was that he saw that evening. Or \"good evening\" as he put it. Trilo: Uhh... von Karma: What in the world... You... Judge: Would the defense kindly explain who it was Trilo saw that evening then? Present Russell Berry profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Considering the ill temper of this witness, there is only one person he would greet!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the person that this witness felt the need to greet that night! Judge: Hmm... How about it, Mr. Quist? Trilo: How about you stop asking me these ridiculous questions! You can show me all the crappy pictures you'd like, there's not one I wouldn't greet! Ben: ... Trilo: What the oak are you doing, Woodman? You better not say, \"Trilo watch your mouth!\" Ben: Ahh... Well... OK. Sorry about that, Trilo. Judge: Order! ORDER! There will be order in my courtroom! Mr. Wright!! Phoenix: (Uh oh, now I've done it!) Judge: You better rethink this line of questioning before I lose my patience with you!! Leads back to: \"Would the defense kindly explain who it was Trilo saw that evening then?\" Phoenix: Considering the ill temper of this witness, there is only one person he would greet! Judge: It must be Regina! It's Regina right!? She's so cute!! Phoenix: No, Your Honor, it is not Regina. If it was Regina, Trilo would have given her the engagement ring as a present. Judge: Oh... Yeah... I suppose you've got a point there. von Karma: It was Russell Berry. The victim himself, was it not? Phoenix: You are correct. It was indeed Russell Berry. Trilo: ...! Phoenix: The person you saw that evening was the victim, the Ringmaster, Russell Berry. That's why you greeted him Trilo. Isn't that correct? Trilo: ... *gulp* Phoenix: Answer the question, Mr. Quist! Trilo: WAAAAHHHH!! AH! Judge: ORDER! ORDER! How do you respond to this!? Trilo: Wa-Wait a second!! Well, at first I thought it was the old man! But! But! Once I got a better look at him, it was obviously Maximillion Galactica! Judge: I think it is high time that we clear the air about this question! Mr. Quist obviously witnessed a single person in the area of the plaza that evening. The problem is identifying exactly who that person was... Was it Maximillion Galactica? Or was it the Ringmaster, one Mr. Russell Berry? von Karma: The prosecution argues that it was the defendant that the witness saw that night! The witness has clearly stated that he saw the defendant's three symbols! Phoenix: Three symbols? Trilo: Alright... This is getting old. C'mon man! You've gotta remember them by now!! Here we go again! Everyone... All together now!! OWWWWW!! von Karma: Yes, yes... We know... The silk hat, cloak, and white roses... Phoenix: Phoenix: A silk hat and a cloak! Anyone could wear them! They'd even look good on me! von Karma: What was that!? Phoenix: Well, the witness has endlessly repeated that he saw Max's three symbols... However, how do we really know it was Maximillion Galactica? It could have been someone else, dressed up as him. Possibly even Russell Berry! von Karma: WHAT!? Judge: Ms. von Karma. von Karma: ... Judge: Do you have clear evidence that the person the witness saw was the defendant? von Karma: Well... I... Judge: If that's the case, then it is impossible for me to make a judgment at this point. Phoenix: (Yes! I think we've finally won a point in this one!!) von Karma: ... That is very... Unfortunate. Phoenix: Huh? von Karma: You're just a little too excited for your own good, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: What do you mean by that? von Karma: You merely established one thing from this witness. You established that this witness saw one person in the plaza that night. I applaud you on your effort, but... Judge: But...? von Karma: Who that person was can only be answered by the next witness! Phoenix: HUH!? von Karma: Your Honor, the prosecution will provide, beyond a shadow of a doubt, an answer to that question, and evidence that clearly establishes one thing. That there is no one other than Maximillion Galactica responsible for this crime! Judge: Very well. The court will take a 10 minute recess. During that time, I request the prosecution prepare their next witness. Court is now in recess! To be continued. December 29, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5 Max: Sw-Sweetie! You have to believe me! I didn't go anywhere near that crime scene! Maya: So then, where were you when the murder took place? Max: We talked about it yesterday, remember? I was in the Ringmaster's room! Phoenix: And while you were there, it was the Ringmaster who left the room, right? Max: Exactly. He told me to wait in the room because he would \"be right back\". Maya: That's when the Ringmaster headed to the scene of the crime... Right? Phoenix: That's what it seems like. Maya: But... The Ringmaster must've been wearing Max's costume. Right? Max: Oh! Sweetie! I just remembered! I went straight to the Ringmaster's room still dressed in my stage clothes. But when I got there, I went ahead and took the costume off. Maya: Which means? Phoenix: It means that the Ringmaster could have taken his costume, and went out looking like Max! Max: FABULOUS! That's a fabulously possible possibility! Maya: Heh Heh... Well done, Nick. Max: However, sweetie... Why would the Ringmaster want to dress up like me? Isn't that a bit strange? Phoenix: Hmm... Max: If you think about it, all they found at the crime scene was my silk hat. What about my cloak? Where did that go? Phoenix: Double hmm... Maya: Wow Max. I never thought of that. You should be a detective or something! Max: Well, I was never quite sure what to be when I grew up... Magician or President? You have no idea how hard it was to make a decision! Maya: That's really cool... Phoenix: (Fabulous... This mystery just keeps getting deeper...) December 29, 12:06 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2 Judge: Now that everyone is back, let's get started. The court is now back in session. Ms. von Karma, please proceed with the prosecution's case. von Karma: Very well... I will now call my next witness. A pitiful clown with the unfortunate distinction of having seen the entire thing. Will Mr. Lawrence Curls please take the stand! Phoenix: (Why did she just call him a \"pitiful\" clown?) von Karma: The witness will state his name and occupation for the court record. Moe: ... von Karma: ... Moe: ... In West Clownadelphia, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent my clowin... von Karma: ... Name and occupation. Judge: Will the witness please inform the court why he is speaking autobiographical gibberish? Moe: O-Oh... I-I'm sorry... I'm just not used to being in court. I've never been in a courtroom in my life. I wasn't quite sure what joke is best suited to this sort of occasion. Judge: What in the world are you talking about!? You're in a grand hall of justice, not some comedy club! Since it's easy to see your occupation, please state your name for the court. Moe: ... Oh... Yeah... Maybe this joke is OK... \"Mom, do I have to wear pants?\" \"The sign only says no shirt, no shoes, no service.\" Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! ..................... Moe: OK! OK! How about this? \"Have you met my proctologist? Dr. Seymour Butts!!\" How was that one!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! ...But a couple of clowns who were up to no good... Started makin' trouble in... (Changed from [...But a couple of clowns, they were up to no good... Started makin' trouble in...] in the original release) von Karma: Your name... Moe: Lawrence Curls. Professional funnyman, also known as Moe the clown. von Karma: You witnessed the scene at around 10:15 PM the day of the murder. Correct? Moe: Yes... Yes it is. Judge: Very well, Mr. Curls. Will you please testify to what you saw that evening? Moe: A rabbi, a priest, and a Rastafarian walked into this plaza... Judge: Without the humor please. Moe: OK... Maya: Aww... Poor Moe can't be his normal stoogey self in court. Witness Testimony -- What You Witnessed -- Moe: I know... I know... I'm not the greatest comedian in the world... I haven't been able to make people laugh for 10 years! No matter what I say, all I get in return is a vacant stare and polite applause. Since no one ever laughs at my jokes, I've taken to laughing at them myself. It's a bad habit, but hey, at least I'm trying!! Imagine my predicament! I'm a clown who can't make people laugh!! I'm almost useless! But I keep trying... I even tried to come up with jokes just for today!! But this atmosphere is very nerve-racking! I decided to try making everyone laugh! Seriously... Everyone... What do you think of me? How am I doing? Judge: ... von Karma: ... Phoenix: Umm... Aren't we the ones supposed to be asking the questions here? von Karma: Witness... Moe: Huh? von Karma: We will listen to your call for help after the court proceedings are over. Thus, please stick with the facts of this case. Moe: Really!? You'll really hear me out!? von Karma: Well, I'll make sure that one of my staff will be your straight man later. Moe: Thank you!! Thank you!! I can't wait!! Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Judge: Now that that's settled, shall we begin once again with the testimony!? Moe: Of course we can! I'll talk for as long as you want!! Witness Testimony -- What You Witnessed -- Moe: The night of the murder, after practice was over, I went straight back to my room. You have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped. I thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window. That's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though! It was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak! I kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head! Judge: That's very interesting... If this eyewitness account is to be believed, I have enough to pass judgment right now... von Karma: Of course you can! There is no way that this account can be criticized. Judge: However... The witness is a bit, how do you say, \"off-kilter\"... Almost like he has some sort of atmosphere of guilt surrounding him. Moe: Aha! Aha! Aha! That must be because of my insincere smile... Judge: Mr. Wright, please begin the defense's cross-examination. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Maya: Nick! You've gotta find some kind of contradiction in his testimony! Phoenix: I know that! Judge: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Your Honor? Judge: I'm afraid that if you push this witness too far, it would bring disaster upon the court. Thus, I sincerely hope you are not going to engage in pointless saber-rattling. Phoenix: I understand, Your Honor. von Karma: If you cause this clown to stray from the facts, I'll hold you responsible! Phoenix: (Why am I responsible!? I'm not the one with the corny jokes.) Cross Examination -- What You Witnessed -- Moe: The night of the murder, after practice was over, I went straight back to my room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You'd say that practice wrapped up around 10 PM correct? Moe: See, that's the thing... Phoenix: Huh? Moe: How exactly am I supposed to make a joke about 10:00 PM? Now eight o'clock... That's something a clown can riff off of... Let's just pretend it was eight o'clock... That way I can make a great joke! Let's not... Phoenix: Let's not make it 8:00 PM, alright Moe? Moe: What do you mean let's not! Don't take the clown out of the clowning around! Maya: C'mon Nick, just listen to his joke! Phoenix: There are three reasons why I don't want to... One, I probably won't laugh. Two, I'll get hit with a penalty. Three, I'll get whipped. Will the witness just proceed with his factual testimony... Maya: You are sooo boring. Leads back to cross-examination Alright, eight o'clock then... Moe: You know you want to hear the joke... A man goes to his doctor and the doctor asks, \"How is number 1?\" The man says \"Everyday at six.\" The doctor asks, \"And 2?\" The man says \"Everyday at seven.\" \"Then what's the matter?\" \"I slept til eight.\" von Karma: Witness! These are exactly the type of jokes you should save for Gumshoe! Phoenix: ... OWWW!! von Karma: You knew what would happen! Don't look at me like that! Judge: Mr. Wright, you're hereby penalized! This will not become a kangaroo court! Phoenix: (This isn't funny at all... In more ways that* ([sic]) one...) Leads back to cross-examination Moe: You have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were \"pooped\" that night? Moe: Yes. I was very very tired... Not to mention I had some bad Mexican food. Phoenix: What? Moe: The double cheese double bean enchilada is a dangerous menu item... What happened after that, as they say, \"happens\"... Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! That one was cool, huh? I hear the kids really love toilet humor these days... Phoenix: That joke was so hip, I don't want to ruin it with a reply. Judge: I've got a good reply though. That joke was so funny it just earned you a penalty! Moe: I thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You just happened to glance out of the window? Moe: You could say that. You could also say I peeked, stared, glimpsed, peeped, eyeballed... Judge: Mr. Curls!! Moe: Oh... I guess synonyms aren't allowed either... Phoenix: (What should I do? I wonder if I should press him further on this issue...) Let it rest. Phoenix: Very well, Moe. How about we get back to your testimony now? Judge: This is definitely one of your more straightforward cross-examinations, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Of course! You threatened me with a penalty if I don't keep this stooge in check!) Keep pressing. Phoenix: Exactly why did you look out of your window that night? Moe: Why!? Why!? Clowns don't need a reason to look out their windows, do they!? Phoenix: That's not what I meant. I meant that... Well... When we spoke yesterday... Moe: Once I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant \"THUMP\"! Moe: ... Oh yeah! I forgot about that!! von Karma: You... forgot!? Phoenix: Your Honor, the witness looked out of his window upon hearing a loud sound. He did not just simply \"glance\" out of his window that night. Moe: Oh yeah! That's right! I forgot to mention that \"THUMP\" didn't I? Owwy Oww Oww... von Karma: That's not something you just \"forget to mention\"! Phoenix: Umm... Yeah... What she said... I believe it would be best if Moe were to revise his testimony. Judge: Hmm... Very well. Mr. Curls. Please revise your testimony. Phoenix: (This should start turning the tables in our favor!) Changes statement from \"I thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.\" to \"I heard a huge noise outside the window, and that's what made me take a look outside...\" Moe: I heard a huge noise outside the window, and that's what made me take a look outside... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What was the sound like? Moe: Well... I guess it kinda sounded like... Hmm... I guess you could say... Judge: Mr. Curls. May the court remind you that humor is unnecessary. Moe: Doh! How'd you know that I was gonna make a joke! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! I guess that the sound sounded like a... I suppose it sounded like someone getting hit with something very hard... Yep. That's what it sounded like. Honestly. Judge: \"Someone getting hit...\" huh? von Karma: What then? You went to look out the window and you saw... Moe: That's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Far away you say... If you had to say exactly, how far away were they? Moe: Let me think about that for a second... If my room is here... And they looked about yay-big... I'd say they were about 30 feet from my window. von Karma: Just 30 feet? That's not far at all! Moe: It was snowing that night, and it cut down on visibility. Judge: I see. Please continue with your testimony regarding the two shadows that you saw. Moe: It was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You'd say you clearly saw this? Even though you were, by your own admission, far away? Moe: That's right. I had been thinking about it over and over since that night, but things didn't really make sense until I spoke with the prosecutor, Ms. von Karma. But now I am 100% certain that it was Max and the Ringmaster that I saw that night. Just think about it? How could I be wrong if Max is always wearing his uppity symbols? Phoenix: Uppity symbols? Moe: Lawyers nowadays!! Do you even have to go to school anymore to be one? Alright! Everyone knows what to do!! Altogether now!! Say it with Uncle Moe! ..................... Moe: ... See what I mean!! It's always like this! The crown never wants to go along with me! I must really be utterly and completely worthless as a clown... Yeowza! von Karma: Enough foolishness, get back on track! Judge: Will the witness please testify as to what he saw... And only what he saw! Moe: I kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You say you saw the Ringmaster get \"clonked\" over the head!? Moe: Yes, I did!! It's the climax of my story! Phoenix: (He really does enjoy the completely random non sequitur...) What would you say the victim was struck with? Moe: You mean weapon? I have no idea. A weapon wasn't found at the murder scene, right? Phoenix: That's not what I meant... You did say you did see \"everything\", didn't you? (Changed from [No no no... You did say you saw the entire thing, didn't you?] in the original release) Moe: Well... I, umm... Yeah, I suppose I did. Wait... No I didn't. I didn't see a weapon... Heh heh heh! Phoenix: Moe! Did you or did you not see the crime of murder committed that night!? von Karma: von Karma: I will not permit you to harass my witness in this manner! You'd better have an excellent reason for attacking this poor, poor clown. Because if you don't... You know what is waiting for you... A nice penalty! Phoenix: *gulp* (Wasn't that a bit melodramatic...) von Karma: So what will it be then, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Do you have any clear basis to believe that my witness did not see the crime? Of course I don't! Phoenix: Well... See... Right now, I don't have a clear basis to be thinking that... von Karma: Then this is just another one of your pointless efforts to badger my witness! Thus, you have just earned yourself a penalty... FROM ME!! Judge: Now wait a second Ms. von Karma! This time, I do not feel the need to treat Mr. Wright so harshly. Phoenix: That's right! What he said! (Bailed out by the judge! What an honor indeed!) Judge: If we must penalize Mr. Wright for his display, I think a verbal censure would be best. Phoenix: Huh? Judge: You know the rules Mr. Wright. There is no room for baseless hounding in this courtroom. Phoenix: (I guess he didn't really bail me out after all...) Leads back to cross-exmaination Of course I do! (before changing third statement) Phoenix: Of course I have grounds to make this claim! von Karma: Then let's hear it! Phoenix: That's something I can't share with you at this time. Judge: W-W-What did you just say!? Mr. Wright!! Phoenix: (I know there's something wrong with this testimony... But I can't put why I feel this way into words for the Judge...) Maya: Maybe we should get a bit more information... Once we find something more solid, we can give it another shot! Phoenix: Yeah, you're right... Judge: Mr. Wright, before we resume testimony, you know that you must be penalized. Phoenix: (Yikes. That's harsh...) Leads back to cross-examination Of course I do! (after changing third statement) Leads to: \"I've got a great reason to make my claim!\" Maya: You know... Moe's testimony and what he told us yesterday are kinda different... Phoenix: Yeah I noticed. We've just got to pinpoint what's changed. Maya: You can do it, Nick! Phoenix: I've got a great reason to make my claim! von Karma: And I suppose you will be telling us all that \"great\" reason? Phoenix: Of course I will... The reason is... The witness' very own testimony! Judge: What is the meaning of that Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Moe said that he heard a sound like a \"thump\" of someone getting hit. Judge: Hmm... He did say that. Phoenix: However, Moe just stated the following under oath. Moe: I kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head! Phoenix: If Moe is to be believed when he says he looked out the window upon hearing a sound, there is no way that he could have seen Max \"clonk\" anyone! Moe: In 1972, a crack clown unit was sent to prison by a circus court for a crime... Judge: Mr. Curls! How do you respond to Mr. Wright's assessment!!? Moe: ...they didn't commit. These clowns promptly escaped from a maximum security clown car... Judge: Mr. Curls, are you reciting the C-Team theme to anger this court? Moe: No no no... I'm just stalling for time while I jog my memory... Maya: Great job, Nick! Phoenix: These types of witnesses always seem to have a selective memory... You just have to peel back the layers of the clown make-up to find the truth. Moe: Well... Umm... Judge: Ahh, you're back from your jog? Moe: Well... It pretty much happened the way I said. Phoenix: \"Pretty much\"...? Moe: When I looked out my window that night, the Ringmaster was already face down in the snow. The prosecution helped me fill in the gaps of my statement. Phoenix: (Von... Von Karma!! Tampering with witnesses again!!) von Karma: ... Judge: So now you are saying that you did not see the defendant \"clonk\" the Ringmaster? Moe: Y-Yes... When I looked out my window, the Ringmaster had already checked out. Judge: Checked out? Moe: Yep. He was on permanent vacation as they say. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Judge: Mr. Curls!! Moe: Your Honor? Judge: You did not witness the actual crime; however, you still say you saw the criminal, correct? Moe: Y-Y-YES!! Exactly! The Ringmaster was slumped over and I saw someone's silhouette next to him. Judge: Very well. Then please testify to this silhouette you saw... I expect the truth! And if I even catch a hint of a joke from you... I will put you in a holding cell until you learn court etiquette, got it!? Moe: Got it. Witness Testimony -- The Silhouette -- Moe: I was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max. There's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols. His silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there! His face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him. His cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying. Judge: Hmm... It does seem as if the defendant was at the scene of the crime. von Karma: It took the clown long enough to get his facts straight. (Changed from [You took your time realizing that, didn't you!?] in the original release) But whatever. This should finally be good enough, yes? (Changed from [Whatever. That should be enough, right!?] in the original release) Judge: It is decisive testimony... Maya: Was Max really at the crime scene that night...? Phoenix: He said he wasn't there. We have to believe in that. (Changed from [He said he wasn't there. We have to keep believing that.] in the original release) Judge: Alright, Mr. Wright. Commence your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Silhouette -- Moe: I was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Don't you think that you are going a little overboard with how explicit you're being? 'That shadow belonged to Max' is an awfully firm statement, don't you think? Moe: What are you getting at...? Phoenix: I'm just saying that one of your fellow performer's life is on the line here. Are you truly, 100% absolutely certain that it was Max? Moe: ... I'm not the kind of person who would lie about something as serious as this! The silhouette I saw was Max. I'm convinced of that. Phoenix: (It doesn't seem like he is jumping to any conclusions this time...) Let's go over this again then. What makes you so sure that you saw Max that night? Moe: There's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Trilo said the same thing. But if it was just the symbols, then even I could have been wearing them. What if someone had just taken Max's symbols and worn them? Moe: I thought of that myself. But just looking at the shape of the face I saw, it must have been Max. Judge: Hmm... You're sure of that!? von Karma: Such a silly little boy... He threw his entire case headlong into a trap! Present Max G. Promo Poster Phoenix: Leads to: \"You say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?\" Moe: His silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're sure that is what you saw that night? Moe: Exactly what I said I saw is exactly what I saw. I've got eyes like a hawk! Phoenix: (Umm... Don't birds have terrible night vision?) Moe: But that's not all I saw! Present Max G. Promo Poster Phoenix: Leads to: \"You say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?\" Moe: His face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were able to see that kind of detail from your window? von Karma: von Karma: There was a light near the scene of the crime. Anyone with decent eyesight should have been able to see that much. Phoenix: Out of curiosity Moe, what is your eyesight like? Moe: I can see like a hawk out of my left eye, and an eagle out of my right eye... von Karma: Our records say his eyesight is a perfect 20/20. Phoenix: (That must mean he could have seen the crime scene clearly.) Judge: Hmm... The more we look into this matter, the more suspicious it becomes. Moe: Hey! You asked me what my eyesight was like, not what it actually was! Moe: His cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you didn't actually see what the criminal was holding? Moe: That's correct. I've been curious to know what caused that loud noise... It must have been something incredibly hard. Phoenix: (Too bad they haven't found the murder weapon to know for sure...) Maya: They claim it was a blunt object... At least it says so in the autopsy report. Phoenix: (With Trilo's testimony, and now Moe's... It really seems like Max is the killer.) Maya: N-Nick... You've gotta find a contradiction in this. Phoenix: That's not going to be enough... Maya: What? Phoenix: I have to prove that Moe saw someone other than Max that night! That's the only thing that will help! I've gotta do it! Phoenix: You say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols? Moe: I suppose so... The silk hat and the cloak, right? Phoenix: Moe... Everyone knows that Maximillion Galactica has three uppity symbols! Moe: Three symbols? Maya: Yay! Everyone get ready!! All... Together... Now... \"SILK HAT! CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\" Moe: What the!? von Karma: Who cares if he knew that there were three or not! He saw what he saw. And he saw the symbols. He just forgot to mention one. Moe: ... von Karma: Isn't that right, Moe? Moe: ... Do you like Pi? I love Pi! 3.141592653589793238462643383279! Tasty! von Karma: Silence fool! You are to respond with the whole truth! No fractions! Judge: Order! Order! Phoenix: Moe! You didn't see the roses, did you!? Moe: To be honest... There wasn't any roses on the person I saw... von Karma: von Karma: The crime scene was dark! It's obvious it was too dark to see that kind of detail! Phoenix: Phoenix: But the witness said he was able to see the silhouette of the criminal's face. Not to mention that the roses are white! There's no way he could have missed them! von Karma: von Karma: Then the roses must have fallen off when the defendant assaulted the victim! Phoenix: If that was the case, then the police would have found them near the crime scene! Judge: Mr. Wright! Are these white roses truly material to the facts of this case? von Karma: Clearly not! He is just toying with this court! Phoenix: ... (I got her on the ropes now... These seemingly insignificant facts have never failed to lead me to the truth yet! (Changed from [Whenever there's a nugget of truth, it always seems to peek out at me... Then run away.] in the original release)) Someone is toying with the court, but it's not me! Your Honor! Do you recall Trilo's testimony? Trilo: There's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols! Trilo: How can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high... Trilo: How could you mistake someone wearing such a snobby 3 piece get-up! Phoenix: Trilo saw them all! Trilo saw all three of Max's symbols! However, this witness claims there were no white roses on the person he saw! There is absolutely no doubt that this is a contradiction! Judge: Hmm... Now what am I supposed to think? One is supposed to disregard the pointless, but this... von Karma: Judge! Forget the roses! Think about his other testimony! The witness has stated without a doubt that he saw Maximillion Galactica! Nothing else matters! Let's wrap this case up now! Phoenix: Your Honor! It may be trivial, but it does cast doubt on the prosecution's case. (Changed from [Your Honor! It may be trivial, but there should still be doubt lingering in your mind!] in the original release) Judge: ... Frankly, I have my doubts about this witness. It seems that, unlike wine, the witness has not grown more mature with age. Moe: I'm not... mature... Judge: I've come to a conclusion... I'm 99% certain that this witness saw the defendant. However! My remaining one percent of doubt is quite reasonable! Which means that for my peace of mind, I'm going to request a bit more testimony. von Karma: W-What!? Judge: If there are no contradictions in his next statement, I am prepared to issue a ruling. Phoenix: (A ruling...!!) Maya: Nick! This is your last chance! Witness Testimony -- The Silhouette, Part 2 -- Moe: There's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night! However, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that. Especially the silk hat! There is no way I could forget seeing the decorations on it! He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene! Judge: Mr. Wright... You've got one last chance at this. Phoenix: Just one chance? Judge: I will not allow even the slightest hint of badgering against this witness. If you are going to prove to me there's a contradiction with Mr. Curls' statement, you'd better have at least a shred of evidence to back up your accusations. Phoenix: (I've only got a single shot as [sic] this... I've got to be careful.) I understand, Your Honor. One chance is all I will need! Cross Examination -- The Silhouette, Part 2 -- Moe: There's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Moe... Be honest... OWWW!! von Karma: You promised Mr. Phoenix Wright. No more badgering! I hope you enjoy this penalty! Phoenix: Ungh... I'm finished... Judge: Umm... Excuse me. I'm the one handing out the pen-- OWWW!! von Karma: Witness, continue with your testimony. Moe: You're not going to whip me too, are you? von Karma: Maybe after court... If you're into that kinda thing. Moe: But isn't it kinda pointless if you only whip me after court? Moe: However, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Moe... Be honest... OWWW!! von Karma: You promised Mr. Phoenix Wright. No more badgering! I hope you enjoy this penalty! Phoenix: Ungh... I'm finished... Judge: Umm... Excuse me. I'm the one handing out the pen-- OWWW!! von Karma: Witness, continue with your testimony. Moe: You're not going to whip me too, are you? von Karma: Maybe after court... If you're into that kinda thing. Moe: But isn't it kinda pointless if you only whip me after court? Moe: Especially the silk hat! There is no way I could forget seeing the decorations on it!

Excuse me. I'm the one handing out the pen-- OWWW!! von Karma: Witness, continue with your testimony. Moe: You're not going to whip me too, are you? von Karma: Maybe after court... If you're into that kinda thing. Moe: But isn't it kinda pointless if you only whip me after court? Moe: He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Moe...

I'm the one handing out the pen-- OWWW!! von Karma: Witness, continue with your testimony. Moe: You're not going to whip me too, are you? von Karma: Maybe after court... If you're into that kinda thing. Moe: But isn't it kinda pointless if you only whip me after court? Present Silk Hat Phoenix: Leads to: \"This wouldn't happen to be the silk hat you saw that night, would it?\" Maya: Whaddya think, Nick? Phoenix: There's no way I'm going to lose after coming this far. There's gotta be an answer. And it's probably in the Court Record! Phoenix: This wouldn't happen to be the silk hat you saw that night, would it? Moe: Yep! That's it! That's the hat he was wearing that night! Phoenix: No question in your mind? Moe: Exactly how would one mistake a thing like that!? Phoenix: I see... Judge: Is there some sort of problem, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ms. von Karma. Where exactly was the silk hat found? von Karma: Must you always ask these questions!? It was found at the crime scene!! ... The c-c-crime scene... That means... Phoenix: The silk hat fell off at the crime scene! However the witness clearly testified to the contrary!! The witness stated that \"he was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!\" Moe: NoooooOOOOOooooo!! That's not trrrrrruuuuueeee!! Judge: ORDER! ORDER!! OOORRRDER!! MR. CURLS!! Moe: Y-Yes, Your Honor? Judge: WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL OF THIS!? You are old enough to know better than to behave like this in court! Moe: Hey! That's just not right!! That's so harsh! Judge: What's not right here is your eyesight and your memory, amongst other things!! Moe: ............... Wh... Why are you being so mean to me!! What did I do!? Lemme guess... You just didn't like my jokes or something, right? You didn't have to go and insult my eyesight or my memory!? They're both great! Seriously!! Why!? Just because you are sitting above me doesn't mean you belong there! And no matter how old I get, I'll always be younger than you!! WAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! *sob* (Changed from [And no matter how old I get, I'll always be younger you!! [sic] WAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! *sobs*] in the original release) ... Judge: ... Enough of these childish outbursts, Mr. Curls! Who do you think you are? Moe: I saw him! I swear I saw him!! It was Max!! Even if he didn't have his roses, he was still wearing his dumb silk hat!! I'm telling the truth!! Maya: He's turned into a bratty little kid. Phoenix: It's pitiful, isn't it? Moe: He left the scene wearing that dumb silk hat! He was there!! Phoenix: (He... left the scene?) Maya: What's the matter, Nick? Phoenix: There's something I've been mulling over for a while now. Moe? Moe: Whaddya want!? Phoenix: You just said that he left the scene... Exactly how did the murderer leave the scene of the crime? Moe: WHAT!? He... Umm... He... Went... Whaddya mean \"how did he leave the scene\"? You can't ask me that!! von Karma: von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright is badgering the witness, Your Honor!! Phoenix: Phoenix: This witness's testimony is so full of holes, Ms. von Karma's protest is useless! von Karma: Grrrr... Judge: You've got a point. Let's hear what the witness has to say on this matter. Is that alright with you, little guy? Moe: Don't talk to me like I'm a little baby!! Besides, what kind of stupid question is \"how did he leave the crime scene!?\" The answer's obvious! He just turned around and walked away!! Phoenix: That's what I expected you'd say... You sure that's how it happened? Moe: Say what!? (Changed from [Hmph!!] in the original release) Judge: Huh? I'm not sure I know exactly where you're going with this... Lawyers nowadays sure do love to harp on the smallest things. Do you have any proof to counter his story as to how the criminal left the scene? Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Look at this picture.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: How about this!? Judge: This isn't your idea of a joke is it, Mr. Wright? von Karma: Not very amusing, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Moe: You're not going to get paid for that one. Maya: It doesn't look like it worked. Phoenix: (What happened? It's like I turned into Moe or something...) Judge: You'll have to excuse me, but I don't understand what you're getting at. Leads back to: \"Do you have any proof to counter his story as to how the criminal left the scene?\" Phoenix: Look at this picture. The problem is the footprints in the snow... Judge: Footprints? Phoenix: In this photo, we can clearly see the footprints of the victim! However, where are the criminal's footprints? They aren't there!! Moe: Ai-yai-yai-yai-yai!! Phoenix: So Moe, exactly how did the criminal escape the scene? Moe: Umm... He... Uh... Phoenix: Your Honor! This witness has already proven that his testimony is completely unreliable! I move to strike all of this witness's testimony from the court record! Judge: I agree... This clown's testimony is as rickety as the clown car he came to court in. Moe: WAIT JUST A SECOND!! You guys can't just ignore everything I've said!! Fine fine! I'll tell you the truth this time... von Karma: YOU WAIT A SECOND! I think you've said more than enough for today!! Moe: That didn't hurt!! I'm sick and tired of listening to you anyways!! I'll give you the real deal this time... I swear!! Maya: I dunno why, but I get the feeling things are gonna get worse before they get better. Judge: Mr. Lawrence Curls. Moe: Yes!? Judge: The testimony you've provided up until now has been false? Moe: It hasn't been false! I haven't lied! It's just... Judge: It's just what? Moe: It's just I was a bit confused on the bit about the criminal leaving the scene. Especially since Von Karma and her whip told me not to talk about what I really saw! Judge: ORDER!! ORDER!! I WILL HAVE ORDER!! Franziska von Karma!! How could you!! von Karma: Your Honor... If you had heard the truth from this witness... You would have exactly the same opinion as I have. Judge: What opinion is that? von Karma: It's not funny! Judge: That's enough out of you! I'm going to listen to what he has to say. Now then, let's hear the truth about what you say you saw, Mr. Curls! (Changed from [Now then, let's hear the truth about what you say you saw!] in the original release) Moe: Hah! You're not gonna believe this but it's all true I tell you! von Karma: Try not to waste our time with your idiotic drivel. Witness Testimony -- The Truth -- Moe: Now it's time for our next segment, \"Moe Knows...\"!! Everything that I've said up until now has been the truth! When I looked out the window, the Ringmaster was down and Max was standing above him! He wasn't wearing his white roses, but he was wearing the silk hat! That's when I saw... He... This is the truth now, get ready for it! He flew! He jumped up and flew through the air!! He flew right off and disappeared into the darkness! That's why there were no footprints! Flying people don't leave footprints! von Karma: I told you it wasn't funny. Do you believe me now? Phoenix: ... Judge: ... ..................... Judge: Well... That was... Umm... How do you put this into words... von Karma: Maximillion Galactica is a world-class magician. But to leave the scene of a crime by flying -- there's no way that actually happened. (Changed from [But to leave the scene of a crime by flying. There's no way that actually happened.] in the original release) Judge: You... You're right. Moe: Why is she right!? You believed the other witnesses! Why won't you believe me!? Especially since it's the best part of the story!! Judge: Hmm... To be honest, this is the first time I've heard of a flying criminal. What do you think about this witness' testimony, Mr. Wright? His eyes are playing tricks. Phoenix: It's obvious that the witness' eyes are playing tricks on him... Moe: Don't be such a fool! Who in the world do you think I would mistake that jerk for!? Phoenix: (Jeez... I didn't say you were lying!) Maya: Wow, he looks really serious right now. More serious than he's looked all day! Leads to: \"I suppose I will let you all in on my thinking regarding this matter...\" He's telling the truth. Phoenix: What he just said was so strange, I don't think he would have made it up. Judge: Which means that he is telling the truth? Phoenix: That's what I think... Maya: Nick, wait! That means that Max actually used magic!! Phoenix: Yikes! You're right! OWWW!! von Karma: Only a foolish looking fool could be fooled by such a foolish fool's foolish dream. Don't be ridiculous! Magic does not exist! Leads to: \"I suppose I will let you all in on my thinking regarding this matter...\" This is all a dream, right? Phoenix: Right now, I can't believe any of this! I'm not even sure if this day hasn't been some kind of Kafkaesque dream... OWWW!! von Karma: Now do you think it's still a dream!? Huh, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Leads to: \"I suppose I will let you all in on my thinking regarding this matter...\" Judge: I suppose I will let you all in on my thinking regarding this matter... \"The criminal disappeared into the sky.\" I'd love to believe that... But I just can't wrap my head around how that could actually happen. von Karma: You imbecile! Judge: If you disregard a need for proof, Ms. von Karma's case is sound. However... I've got the feeling that this case is in dire need of more investigation. von Karma: ...! Judge: Thus I will conclude today's proceedings at this point! It's an undisputed fact that the criminal left no footprints at the scene. Tomorrow, I want us to find out the reason behind this mystery of mysteries. Phoenix: Umm, uhh... von Karma: Grrr... Judge: I believe that's enough for today. Court is adjourned! (Changed from [I believe that's enough for today. Court is now in recess!] in the original release) December 29, 2:33 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5 Max: Hey! Sweeties! What in the world is going on!? Phoenix: That's what I want to know! Maya: They say the criminal flew off into the air and disappeared! Phoenix: Max, I can't believe I'm asking this, but you didn't fly that night, did you? Max: I know you didn't mean to ask me such a fabulously stupid question! I can't fly whenever I please. It's not that easy!! Maya: But it looks so effortless for you on stage... Max: It's not that simple!! I'm not actually flying on stage! I use invisible wires and have them hoist me through the air! Maya: Wow... You just told me the secret to your magic!! Max: NO!! I broke the first rule... The cardinal rule... The ONLY RULE! Phoenix: I'm sorry, Max. We made you break a magician's creed to never reveal the secret to their tricks. (Changed from [I'm sorry you had to break a magician's creed to keep the magic tricks secret...] in the original release) Maya: Nick! What do we do now!? Phoenix: All we can do now is hope we find the flying criminal in court tomorrow. Maya: Great idea! Let's do our best and catch this sucker! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Billy Bob Johns... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Turnabout Big Top Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 December 29, 3:03 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Umm... Nick? Phoenix: What is it? Maya: I've got a confession to make... I'm terrible at figuring out magic tricks... Phoenix: Magic tricks? Maya: Yep. Magic tricks are by their very definition tricks, right? But I can never figure out the tricks when I see them. (Changed from [But I can never figure out the tricks when I see them. I'm just not good at it...] in the original release) Phoenix: That's because the tricks are performed by pros. They do it so you can't guess the trick. Maya: But but... The trick Pearly showed me was incredible! Phoenix: Pearls did a magic trick? Hmm... What kind of trick was it? Maya: Let's see. It looked like she pulled the end of her own thumb off! Phoenix: Heh... Maya: First she put her right thumb next to her left hand, and then it just separated! She could move it up and down and everything! It was incredible! Phoenix: Really? Was it kinda like this...? Maya: WHAT!? WOW! HOW'D YOU DO THAT!? Nick, you're like a real magician! See this is why I just can't figure out magic... I'm no good at it... Especially hard tricks like flying away from the scene of a murder... Phoenix: You'll take all the fun out of magic if you keep trying to figure it out. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. Maya: Hey! I'm reading that one! You know I'm studying the law now, right!? I put that bookmark on the page I was reading... Don't you dare move it! Phoenix: What!? You're reading!? THESE!? A bookmark, huh... Hmm... You mean this thing? It was only on the second page. Maya: Well, you have to start somewhere right? Phoenix: You do realize that you have 1000 pages to go right? Maya: ... Maybe you really should sell all these books, Nick. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. Maya: Nick, you've been watering the plant everyday, right? I've been thinking about watering it too. Phoenix: Maya, we don't want to drown poor Charley. Maya: But he'd get bigger! Phoenix: (Does she want the office to look like a tropical rain forest or something?) Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Maya: Umm... It's covered with dust. Maybe you should use your desk every now and again. Movie poster Phoenix: A poster of the newest member of the \"Steel Samurai\" universe. Maya: You know about the new \"Steel Samurai\" movie they are making, don't you Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, I heard that they're making a movie starring the new cast. Maya: It's already out! Critics say, \"Time to commit 'hara-kiri' if you miss this action epic!\" Phoenix: You don't say... Maya: You know, I bet the star will win this year's Hero of Heroes Grand Prix!! Phoenix: *yawn* Uh huh... Maya: ... Phoenix: Alright already... I'll go see the movie!! Maya: Yay! Let's hurry and wrap this case up so we can see it! Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Maya: Lately they've been holding huge events at the Gatewater. It seems they've really become a top-class hotel. I wonder if that bellboy would remember us? Talk What to do Phoenix: I don't see any way out of this. We're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Maya: There's no way we can solve the mystery of a criminal flying by tomorrow... I was thinking... Do you really think the criminal flew through the air? The only one who thinks that is Moe, right? He says that he saw it. Phoenix: That's true... Moe looked awfully serious when he said that. Maya: Do you think he might be trying to frame Max? Phoenix: If that was it, he would have simply said \"I saw Max\". That would have been enough. There's no reason why anyone would believe \"he flew\". Maya: But... What if the criminal really did fly? There's only one person who could do that... Max. Phoenix: (You're really not helping my confidence here, Maya...) Any ideas Maya: Everyone seems to hate Max. Ben, Trilo, Moe... They all have nothing nice to say. Phoenix: That magician does seem rather full of himself, doesn't he? Especially when he says things like customers only go to the circus to see him. Maya: He even hit Ben over the head with a bottle. But... Phoenix: But what? Maya: But that doesn't seem enough to frame another person for murder!! Phoenix: And it was proven that neither Ben nor Moe lied on the stand. Maya: Maybe Ben saw the Ringmaster wearing Max's costume, but Moe clearly said that he saw Max himself. Present Crime Photo Maya: Oh yeah... The picture of the scene. I wonder what that wooden box is? Phoenix: It was probably left at the scene. Maya: I can't believe there was only a bottle of pepper in that thing. It must be related to the crime somehow... This is fun, isn't it Nick? Phoenix: Not really... It may be fun to solve mysteries, but don't forget this is a murder case. Maya: Awww... You're right. I should take things more seriously. Silk Hat Maya: No matter how you look at it, this is definitely Max's silk hat. Phoenix: There's even a feather stuck in it. Maya: There's something wrong with this hat though. Phoenix: Moe's testimony, right? \"He left the scene wearing that dumb silk hat!\" That's what he said, but the hat was found on the ground at the scene. Maya: Hmm... This really is a mystery. Broken Bottle Maya: Whoa. Max used a broken bottle to crack Ben over the head? Phoenix: No no no... It broke because Max cracked Ben over the head with it. Maya: He must have really hit him hard then... I guess I should give it a try... For research purposes. Come here... I've got a nice bottle right here for you Nick... Phoenix: YEOW!! Maya: That's weird. It didn't break. Phoenix: Of course it didn't!! You hit me with a plastic bottle!! Ring Maya: Can you believe this cost three months of pay? Three months!! Trilo doesn't skimp when it comes to Regina. He's really in love. Phoenix: It looks like a real glass stone. Its brilliance is amazing. Maya: I bet Money would love to get his hands on this again. Phoenix: (I'll have to give this back to Trilo sometime...) Wooden Box Maya: Twenty pounds, huh? That's pretty heavy. Phoenix: Especially since the only thing inside was a small bottle of pepper. Maya: The more you think about it the more it starts to make your head hurt. But compared to tomorrow this will all be a happy memory. Phoenix: Tomorrow!? Don't get ahead of yourself Maya... Let's concentrate on today. Small Seasoning Bottle Maya: You wanna know something Nick? I love to put pepper on my hamburgers. But I also like to put pepper on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Do you think I'm weird? Phoenix: ... Maya: You don't seem to be in a very good mood today. Phoenix: Of course I'm not... I have to find a criminal who has discovered the ability to fly. Maya: Yeah. I guess that would put you in a bad mood. Max profile Maya: If Moe says that he saw a flying criminal, that means it must have been... Phoenix: What's the matter with you!? You know that people can't just up and fly! Maya: But Max... He is a magician. Phoenix: Without their bag of tricks, magicians are incapable of magic. Besides, what's the likelihood someone set up a flying device at the crime scene? Near zero. Maya: What if they set something up so they could trick Moe? Phoenix: Umm... Maybe. But I get the feeling that would have been pointless... Anything else Phoenix: What about this? Maya: Umm... Yeah... Sorry. I got nothing. Phoenix: (She must have been trying to think up a joke or something.) December 29Detention CenterVisitor's Room Max: Oh! My sweeties!! You mind hurrying up and getting me out of this place!? Phoenix: We're doing our best, Max. Just hang in there. Max: A little while ago, some people from a local TV station came by... And since I'm a famed magician, they said, \"Let's make you your very own TV special!\" (Changed from [They said that, since I'm a famed magician, 'Let's make your very own TV special!'] in the original release) Maya: Really? What kind of TV special? Max: \"Maximillion Galactica: The Great Prison Escape\" It would be aired live. Maya: Hey! That sounds like it would be an awesome special! Max: But if I do the special before I'm acquitted, they'll never let me out of here for real. Phoenix: Well, it would surely be an unnecessary addition to your troubles with the law. Max: That's what I was thinking... But the production staff is already working on the show! If you don't get me out quick, I'll have no choice but to stage a real prison break. Phoenix: You seem awfully calm about that possibility... Max: I'd have no choice. It would be a contractual obligation... That's show business. Talk Night of the murder Phoenix: Umm. The night of the crime... You didn't happen to fly off into the sky, did you? Max: Here is how everything went down, sweetie. At the time of the murder, I was sitting in the Ringmaster's room. Not to mention... Flying off into the sky is not just something I can do at will. I don't care what the stoogey clown says, it wasn't me. Maya: Max! Max! Do you mind teaching me the trick behind flying? Max: Hmm... You'll have to forgive me, sweetie. The difference between me and cheap imitation magicians is that I keep my mouth shut. I don't teach people tricks, but I will say this much. It's much harder than you think. Today's trial Maya: I was thinking about this in court today... I've got a favor to ask of you. Max: Anything for you, sweetie. Maya: Be friends with the other performers in the circus! Max: FABULOUS! A great joke!! Why would I be friends with a bunch of hacks like them? (Changed from [FABULOUS! A great joke!! Why would I be friends with a bunch of hacks like that?] in the original release) Maya: But...! Max: I've won on the world stage! I won the International Grand Prix! Phoenix: International Grand Prix? Max: Performers should always look to perform on the world stage! But the performers at this circus are completely and utterly devoid of ambition! That is something that I can simply not tolerate! Phoenix: (Ambition, huh...?) Maya: Something about what Max just said rings true to my ears... Grand Prix (appears after \"Today's trial\") Max: Oh my! My sweeties want to hear all about the Grand Prix, don't they? To be honest though, I've told this story like 100 times already, so it's a bit boring. Phoenix: We're sorry to make you tell it again. Max: You must not have heard me... I am really sick of telling this story. But what can you do? I'm Maximillion Galactica. I suppose I can tell it again. ... Voila! Here, take a look at this! I just happen to have a picture from the Grand Prix with me. Just look at that fabulous stage!! That is the first stage that I ever flew on. I flew right over the audience! The crowd erupted into applause! At that time, I thought to myself that I could die right then and die a happy man. I'll never forget how I felt that night. The emotions... The acclaim... Maya: Wow. Max: *ahem* By the way... I think everyone who is a performer should get to experience that feeling. I just wish I could explain that to the other people in the circus! Maya: That's incredible Max... I want a trophy too! Hey Nick! How about you buy me a trophy!? Phoenix: That's not how you earn a trophy Maya! Max: My sweeties, you can have this picture of my triumph... Just make sure you show it to all the other members of the circus. \"Look and learn!\" That's what you should tell them. (Changed from ['Watch and learn!' That's what you should tell them.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Learn how to get thrown in jail?) Grand Prix Photo added to the Court Record. Grand Prix (subsequent times) Max: Oh my! My sweeties want to hear all about the Grand Prix, don't they? To be honest though, I've told this story like 100 times already, so it's a bit boring. Phoenix: We're sorry to make you tell it again. Max: You must not have heard me... I am really sick of telling this story. But what can you do? I'm Maximillion Galactica. I suppose I can tell it again. ... Voila! Here, take a look at this!

Just make sure you show it to all the other members of the circus. \"Look and learn!\" That's what you should tell them. (Changed from ['Watch and learn!' That's what you should tell them.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Learn how to get thrown in jail?) Present Silk Hat Max: This is definitely my silk hat. I don't suppose I'm allowed to wear it anymore am I? Phoenix: Max, this one of your uppi... I mean, excellent symbols, right? Max: That's right. Honestly though, I only like it because of the feather in the brim. Broken Bottle Maya: Max! How could you!? How could you hit poor Ben over the head with this!? Max: I've been thinking about that lately... But he did call me a \"no-good talentless hack of a fast food magician\"... Maya: You mean Trilo said that? Not Ben, right? Max: There is no Trilo or Ben. There is only one Benjamin Woodman. Maya: Hmm... I guess you're right. Grand Prix Photo Max: I'm normally fabulous, but in this picture, I'm the king of the world! I even got a fabulous trophy and a super fabulous bust. Maya: That's really cool! I wouldn't mind seeing your trophy some day. Max: If you want to see one of my awards, you should just go to the cafeteria. Maya: The cafeteria? You mean the one inside the circus tent? Max: Of course. The trophy isn't there, but the bust that I won is! Maya: It's in the cafeteria? We were just there yesterday. Nick, did you see a bust anywhere inside the cafeteria? December 29Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance Maya: You hear that? It sounds like two people arguing... Trilo: Alright, let's do it. Are you ready? Ben: Y-Yes... A-Ah... Wait... Trilo: Quit your whining! Let's just give this a shot already! Alright! Let's go! Ben: Row-row-row-your-boat! Trilo: Row-row-row-your-boat! Ben: ... Trilo: What are you doing!? Gently-down-the-stream! C'mon, you know that!! Ben: I'm trying my best, but... Trilo, this just isn't going to work... Trilo: Do you enjoy saying dumb things? You're going to have to be on your own someday! If you can't handle something as simple as this, what are you going to do then!? Maya: Hello Ben. Hello to you too, Trilo. Trilo: What are you doing here!? Can't you see we're on a secret crash training course!? Maya: I'm sorry... Phoenix: Secret crash training! Whoa. Ben: Yes. Trilo wouldn't give up until I said we'd try out his idea for a new routine. So... We were trying to sing in a round for our new ventriloquism act. Maya: In a round!? You can really do that!? That's incredible! Trilo: See! See! Even they are surprised by the idea!! I told you!! Ben: They're not the only ones!! You even surprised me with your idea!! Trilo: Once we've got a grip on the basics, then it's just a matter of practice! Ben: Y-Y-You t-t-think so? Maya: Oh, I almost forgot! I wanted to give this back to you. Trilo: Ahh! There it is!! Now that I've got this ring back, it's time to take one more shot at Regina! Examine Door Maya: The murder took place right over there.. Phoenix: You never really get used to the feeling of being where someone's life was taken. Maya: I know... The Ringmaster seems like he was such a good man. It * ([sic]) so sad... For everyone. Talk Today's trial Maya: Umm... I know that you already testified in court today... Trilo: You want to talk about what we saw, right? Maya: Yes. Trilo: Well, at first we thought it was the old man... Just looking at his walk and how he acted. Right Ben? Ben: Huh!? Oh, oh yeah. That's right. Trilo: But then we said hello and didn't even get a reply. Not to mention he was draped in those gaudy symbols. Maya: What would you have thought if he wasn't wearing those symbols? Trilo: Hmm... What do you think Ben? Ben: What!? Oh... Umm... I would have thought it was the Ringmaster. Phoenix: (Hmm... Something just isn't adding up here. I wonder who they really saw?) Marriage Maya: I was hoping I could ask you about Regina... Trilo: I'm completely serious about her! That's why I'm waiting for her even now! Maya: Really? That's so sweet... But if you really wanted to see Regina, shouldn't you check out the tent? Trilo: Hah! You haven't got a clue about things, do you sweetheart? Maya: Eh? Trilo: Waiting like this is part of being in love. Maya: How so? Trilo: If you had a clue, you would know that waiting is such sweet, wonderful torture. When your body aches for your partner's love... That's one of the best parts!! Maya: Umm... Y-Yeah... I-I knew that... Phoenix: (Poor Maya... She's so red she looks like a vine ripe tomato!) Ventriloquism Maya: So how is this new routine working out? Trilo: Will you two just take a chill pill already!? Our routines are secret!! We're going to take the ventriloquism world by storm! It'll be a real revolution! Maya: That sounds incredible! Trilo: But let me make one thing clear... We're not going to take on the world just because that stupid jerk said we should... Phoenix: That jerk? Trilo: Max Galactica. \"Performers should aim for the world!\" Who does he think he is!? Maya: Trilo, you seem to really be fired up about all this!! Trilo: He needs to realize that he isn't the only one who can conquer the world stage! Maya: You're right! You're right! Trilo: Mark my words... I, Trilo Quist, will win the Grand Prix!! Maya: You're the man now, doll! Trilo: \"Row-row-row-your-boat!\" will be the key to a glorious victory!! Phoenix: Umm... Not to rain on your parade, but wouldn't a more mature song be best? Trilo: Hey... You've got to start somewhere right? Ben: ... Trilo: Don't screw this up! You've gotta be a part of this too. Present Anything Maya: Would you mind taking a look at this? Ben: Um... Umm... Uh... I-I-I-I... Umm... That... U-U-U-Uhh... I-I-I-I-It's... Maya: ... I guess we won't need you to look at this after all. December 29Berry Big CircusBig Top Maya: Huh? Where's Regina? Phoenix: I dunno... But if she's with that tiger, I don't want to find out!! Let's hurry up and get out of here! Maya: Hehe... Nick. You're kinda a chicken, aren't you? Phoenix: No no no no no... I'm just... Umm... Allergic to wild tigers! December 29Big TopRingmaster's Room Maya: Max and the Ringmaster had their talk in this room. Phoenix: That could have been when the Ringmaster put on Max's costume and went outside. Maya: Why'd he do that? Maybe it was cold or something? December 29Big TopCafeteria Maya: They still haven't cleaned this place up yet. If Pearly got one look at the state of this place... She'd slap whoever was in charge across the face!! Phoenix: (Remind me to never invite her to my office.) December 29Lodging HousePlaza Gumshoe: Oh, it's you two. Phoenix: You look like you just got hit by a truck. Shouldn't you get some rest? Gumshoe: *sigh* I'm taking a rest right now, pal. (Changed from [Nah... I'm taking a rest right now, pal.] in the original release) I've been listening to some crazy clown's life story. Ms. von Karma told me to come down here and do this for her. Phoenix: Yeah, I figured as much... (Changed from [Being bossed around by a woman... I know how you feel.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Let me tell you something, pal. Listening to that old clown sucks all your energy. Every time he's done talkin' he looks at you like you should be doing something... Phoenix: Umm... I think he's waiting for you to laugh at his jokes. Gumshoe: I know that, pal. Do you have any idea how much your face hurts if you fake laughing that much? Maya: Franziska really set you up bad this time, didn't she? If you ask me, she should be listening to Moe herself... Gumshoe: No way, pal. You're not gonna get me to backbite a woman with a whip. No way. Maya: Why are you defending her? Gumshoe: Prosecutor von Karma's always got her eyes on us. And every time you definitely don't want her to show up... *poof* There she is!! Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Phoenix: (Looks like she's wound him pretty tight...) Gumshoe: She's directly above us as we speak. Maya: Huh? How's that possible? Gumshoe: According to the clown, the criminal jumped from here and disappeared into the sky. If that's what happened, it means the killer passed right by this window, pal. Maya: Oh, I see... Who lives in that room behind the window up there? Gumshoe: The acrobat's got his room up on the third floor, it seems. Pretty soon, Ms. von Karma's gonna start her investigation up there. So don't get any ideas of going up to the acrobat's room, got it pal? Maya: *shivers* F-Franziska von Karma... (Changed from [*shivers* V-Von Karma...] in the original release) Phoenix: (Once she's done with her investigation, I think I'll go up there and check it out.) December 29Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room Phoenix: Moe's not here... Maya: If he was here, you would have been able to tell even before you stepped into his room. I'm sure you would've heard him laughing away... \"Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\" Phoenix: What do you think he is laughing at when he's all by himself? Maya: I always thought he was just thinking up new jokes. Phoenix: (Hmm... He must really love his work...) Examine Pajamas Phoenix: Moe's got an excellent pair of pajamas... Laid on his bed in an excellent manner. Maya: They're not actually pajamas. They're actually costumes. Uh huh... I guess you could say that they're professional sleepwear. Shoes or banana peel Maya: You've really gotta give it to Moe... Slipping on a banana 100 times a day. That's incredible. Maybe I should try giving it a shot myself. I guess I'll start out by juggling. Phoenix: (Maybe you should start with spirit channeling... Just a thought...) Window Maya: This is where Moe witnessed the crime. Phoenix: Well this is where Moe witnessed some craziness... (I mean, c'mon... A flying criminal... Jeez... If we had a normal judge, he'd never believe something like that...) Carrots Maya: These carrots like like they are the pick of the crop, don't they? Phoenix: I still don't get why he went with carrots... Maya: Hmm... What do you think about this theory? A long time ago, the circus was down on its luck. Moe was so hungry that he had to steal the horses food to survive. But he got addicted to their orangey goodness... Ha ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (I'd laugh, but I think Maya might not be too far from the truth.) Clown equipment Maya: Tee hee... Clown equipment is so funny looking! Phoenix: He's got a balancing ball, a unicycle... He's even got a trampoline!! ... But they're all broken. Maya: Well, you've got to give them all a shot. Trying is the most important thing!! Phoenix: (He sure seems to have tried them all... But were any of them useful?) After visiting Moe's Room: December 29Big TopCafeteria Moe: Ah! Wright!! Welcome to the wonderful, the fabulous, the cafeteria! Phoenix: (Yikes... He's in an awfully good mood...) Moe: Alright! You know what time it is!! Riddle time!! Why does everyone cry when they eat Mexican pizza? Phoenix: Umm... Moe: C'mon! You can answer this! It's easy!! Phoenix: ...Because cafeteria Mexican pizza is possibly a weapon of bowel destruction? Moe: *BUZZ* Wrong! Try again! OK! What do you think, girlie? Maya: Umm... Ahh! I got it!! Moe: OK!! What is your answer? Maya: Because they are in the Caf\u00e9 Teary Eye! Moe: Exactly!! It's an incredibly sad place, that caf\u00e9. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Maya: I did it!! Phoenix: (What's going on? He's being too nice...) Examine Kitchen Phoenix: The kitchen is over here. Moe: Oh yeah! Oh yeah! I wrote a new joke about the kitchen... Let's see... How did that joke go... Umm... Phoenix: (Lemme guess... \"What did the chef say to the chicken before dinner? Knife to meet ya!\" It's gotta be something dumb like that...) Moe: What did the chef say to the chicken before dinner? Knife to meet ya! Maya: That's a great one Moe. I would have never thought of that. Notice Maya: \"Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!\" Moe: Take a good look at that sign girlie. Maya: Huh? It says... \"Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!?\" Moe: I added a question mark on there... I'm thinking that might be why the cafeteria is so dirty. Back table Phoenix: There are dirty dishes all over the place... It must have been too hectic that night to clean up. Maya: You know I can't stand a mess Nick! I think you and I should clean this place up for them! Moe: Yay! You two are going to help us restore order to this cafeteria!? Phoenix: What are you talking about? You're gonna help too! Moe: Clowns can't clean!! We're here to throw pies, not clean them up! I'm a bust-a-gut boy, not a bus boy! Get it... It was two jokes in one! I'm fat and funny! Get it!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Phoenix: Yes. Moe. We got it. Maya: Uhhh... Dining tables Phoenix: It looks like they've left it exactly as it was on the night of the murder. Moe: I was in charge of the cooking that day. It was going to be a special menu. Maya: Really? What were you going to cook? Moe: Moe Moo Burgers. Phoenix: What are those? Moe: A beefy burger filled with laughs and a sauce that tastes like my jokes. They're outstanding. Phoenix: (So those burgers leave just as bad of a taste in your mouth as his jokes then.) Knocked over chairs Phoenix: The chair's been knocked over. Maya: That's what it looks like. Moe: Looking at all this brings back lots of memories. Phoenix: What do you mean? Moe: I proposed here... To a girl on horseback. Of course, I was much younger back then. Maya: So what happened? What was her answer? Moe: Well... Let's just say that my love was put out to pasture. Talk Today's trial Maya: Today's been a really crazy day, hasn't it? Moe: You're telling me! I didn't think it was going to be so tough. Maya: Tough? Moe: Yeah. It was a tough crowd. That's what you call a crowd that refuses to laugh. For instance, it was such a tough crowd last night I had to smash watermelons. Maya: Hmm... Moe: I told them all a great story and even greater jokes, but no one busted out laughing... Maya: You even used the famed \"No shoes, no shirt, no service\" joke! Moe: Exactly! How can you not laugh at stunning comedy like that!? What you witnessed Phoenix: Are you 100% sure about your testimony today? Moe: I saw that I saw! I swear! That creep just... Maya: Flew through the air? Moe: It wasn't exactly flying per say... It was more like floating. The silhouette of his face made me positive it was Max! Phoenix: (I don't see a Psyche-Lock... He must be telling the truth.) Max's Bust (appears after presenting Grand Prix Photo) Moe: Max's bust should be on that small table over there. Phoenix: There's nothing over there. Moe: Really? ... Oh yeah. Hmm... When was it...? I'd say about five days ago, all of a sudden... The bust disappeared. Maya: It disappeared? Moe: If you want to see it, there's a photo on the bulletin board over there. Max just had to put the picture up. Maya: Hmm... Hey! This thing is really cool! Nick! Nick! I want someone to make a bust of me! Phoenix: Sure, as long as I'm not paying for it. Maya: Aww... Max G. Bust added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Is there anything else that's changed about this place? Moe: Nope. Nothing's changed that I can see... Phoenix: (I wonder if he's actually thinking about this, or if he is setting up a bad joke?) Moe: Nope nope... I'm drawing a blank here. Phoenix: (A quiet Moe is a good Moe in my book.) Maya: I guess there really aren't any other things that have changed, huh? Moe: Well... There is this one tinsy tiny thing that does seem different. Phoenix: Tell us! Tell us! Max's Bust (subsequent times) Moe: Max's bust should be on that small table over there. Phoenix: There's nothing over there. Moe: Really? ... Oh yeah. Hmm... When was it...?

Maya: I guess there really aren't any other things that have changed, huh? Moe: Well... There is this one tinsy tiny thing that does seem different. Phoenix: Tell us! Tell us! What changed (appears after \"Max's Bust\") Moe: Well... On the morning of the crime, over on that bulletin board... This piece of paper was posted front and center. Phoenix: Piece of paper? Moe: It's torn, so I don't know what it said, but I could see its title. (Changed from [It's torn, so I don't know what it said, but I could see it's [sic] title.] in the original release) Maya: Yikes! It says, \"To The Murderer!!\" Phoenix: M-M-M-Murderer!? Moe: Yup, that's what it says. But the rest of it has been ripped off. And I don't know who posted it. Phoenix: Umm... When did you find this? Moe: The morning before the murder. Maya: Before the murder!? Moe: Yes. The Ringmaster was killed the night after this paper was discovered. Phoenix: (Who in the world posted this thing...?) Note added to the Court Record. Maya: Nick! I think we'd better follow up on this important lead! (Changed from [Nick! I think this is a very important clue!] in the original release) What changed (subsequent times) Moe: Well... On the morning of the crime, over on that bulletin board... This piece of paper was posted front and center. Phoenix: Piece of paper? Moe: It's torn, so I don't know what it said, but I could see its title. (Changed from [It's torn, so I don't know what it said, but I could see it's [sic] title.] in the original release) Maya: Yikes! It says, \"To The Murderer!!\" Phoenix: M-M-M-Murderer!? Moell Yup, that's what it says. But the rest of it has been ripped off. And I don't know who posted it. Phoenix: Umm... When did you find this? Moe: The morning before the murder. Maya: Before the murder!? Moe: Yes. The Ringmaster was killed the night after this paper was discovered. Phoenix: (Who in the world posted this thing...?) Maya: Nick! I think we'd better follow up on this important lead! (Changed from [Nick! I think this is a very important clue!] in the original release) Present Silk Hat, Ringmaster's Papers, Max G. Promo Poster, Max G. Bust, or Max profile Moe: I can't stand Max and his attitude sometimes! Maya: I know... Moe: But lately... Maya: Huh? Moe: It's just... Lately I've started to understand what he is always going on about. Maya: What is is then? Moe: Well... Umm... I'm not sure if I can explain it all that well just yet... Phoenix: (Just when you think it's impossible, Moe flashes a glimpse of maturity...) Grand Prix Photo Moe: Ahh! Not this picture!! He showed it to you guys too? Maya: Huh? You've seen it as well? Moe: Well, you know what they say about Maximillion Galactica... He really gets around. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Maya: Hehe. Moe: Oh yeah... He didn't just show me the picture! Maya: What do you mean? Moe: He showed me his bust too. Let me tell you, that thing is enormous! It's in the picture, I think. He'd make us worship it... Everyday. He made us bow to his greatness. Phoenix: (He's got a... big... bust? I wouldn't mind hearing more about Max's bust... Not that I'm into that sorta thing...) Note Moe: The morning of the murder, this was posted up on the bulletin board. That's when Max clonked Ben over the head. Sorry I hadn't remembered it until now. It was torn down before anyone really paid any attention to it. Phoenix: So you don't know what was written on it, do you? Moe: Unfortunately I don't. But I betcha they would know! Phoenix: Who are \"they\"? Moe: Max and Ben. They were at the cafeteria earlier than I was that morning. Anything else Moe: Sorry, but I don't know anything about that. Maya: I see... Moe: After all, I'm just a clown. Phoenix: (I concede Moe's a clown, but I get the feeling he's not your average clown...) Detention Center Present Note Maya: Do you know anything about this note? Phoenix: The morning of the murder, it was posted on the wall in the cafeteria... Max: I do know all about that note. When I read it, my heart certainly skipped a beat. Maya: Your heart skipped a beat? Max: While I was enjoying my morning tea, the Ringmaster and company entered the room. Phoenix: And company...? Max: I guess it wasn't really a company... It was just the Ringmaster and my sweetie pie. When the Ringmaster read the note, he turned an incredible bright red. All of a sudden he tore it off the wall and shoved it into the pocket of his tailcoat! Maya: Really!? Out of curiosity, what in the world was written on that thing? Max: ... Let's see... Maya: Uh-huh... Max: Oh I don't want to steal the fun from my sweeties! Go and find out on your own! I'm sure you can find it somewhere. You might also want to ask my sweetie pie princess. Big Top - Ringmaster's Room (after presenting Note in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Examine Tailcoat Maya: Hey, do you see that? There's a scrap of paper shoved into the pocket of the tailcoat. Phoenix: You know... I've got a feeling I know what that is... Maya: I bet that's the other half of the note that Moe gave us. Then let's hurry up and check this thing out, Nick! I knew it! It fits perfectly with the other piece. Phoenix: What does it say? What does it say? \"To The Murderer! I have conclusive evidence of what took place. Meet at 10:00 PM tonight at the lodging house plaza.\" Maya: Tonight at 10:00 PM? Phoenix: That's when the murder took place! Maya: Now we need to find out who called out the Ringmaster!! Note updated in the Court Record. Tailcoat (subsequent times) Phoenix: The Ringmaster's tailcoat. Maya: It's been expertly cleaned and pressed. It's got one perfect crease. Phoenix: The Ringmaster must have liked things neat and tidy. Maya: This is kinda pointless isn't it? There's no way this beats Moe's room. Now that's cool! Phoenix: (All I can hear in my head right now is \"Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\") After presenting Note in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, then examining tailcoat in Big Top - Ringmaster's Room: December 29Big TopCafeteria Maya: Wha...? Moe's gone. Phoenix: There's a message on the bulletin board. \"I'm hungry so I'm off to get some hamburgers! Love, Moe.\" Maya: Mmmm... Hammburrgeerrrr... Just thinking about it is making me hungry! All of a sudden I need a burger bad!! Phoenix: (All of a sudden, I need a new partner... BAD!!) After presenting Note in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, then examining tailcoat in Big Top - Ringmaster's Room: December 29Lodging HousePlaza Maya: Hey Detective Gumshoe! I'm sure you did a good job as usual. Gumshoe: Well, I am done with the investigation of the acrobat. Finally. But with Ms. von Karma... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... Maya: Nick, what is that? That beeping sound? Phoenix: Hmm... Gumshoe: It's Ms. von Karma. Maya: Huh? Gumshoe: Every time I hear that sound, she's usually not very far behind! Phoenix: Some sort of pager or something? Gumshoe: If you don't mind pal, I'm gonna go ahead and get outta here... Quick. See ya, pal!! Maya: I didn't know that Gumshoe could run that fast! So much for being a flatfoot. Phoenix: (Never seen a grown man so afraid of a girl still in her teens!) Maya: Well, let's go inside... It's freezing out here! The wind's as biting as... (Changed from [Uh oh... The whi...] in the original release) OWWWW!! ...As biting as lashes from a whip!! (Changed from [That whip could cut right through me...!!] in the original release) Phoenix: Von... Von... Von... Karma!! (She really did appear!!) von Karma: It was a real battle today in court, wasn't it... Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: Did you have to jump out and scare us like that? What can I do for you? von Karma: Tomorrow will be the day. The day my dream finally comes true! Phoenix: You mean the story of my defeat at your hands making the national news? von Karma: Ha ha ha... National news? You possess such a small sense of scale... The global news, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Your miserable plight will be known internationally! Phoenix: (I think she might be overestimating the importance of a win by just a smudge...) Talk Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: Ms. von Karma... It appears you got your hands onto something big, huh? (Changed from [Von Karma... It appears you got your hands onto something, eh?] in the original release) von Karma: Hah! I'm amazed you picked up on that much. Phoenix: (Anyone could. You couldn't hide that look of victory with ten paper bags on your head!) von Karma: I've got \"conclusive evidence\" and a \"conclusive witness\"... Need any more hints? Phoenix: \"A conclusive witness\"... You must mean the acrobat, right? von Karma: I'm putting in the summons for him to be called as a witness as we speak. It's the final nail in your coffin, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it already, you want to beat and destroy me. I can't worry about her. I've got to try and find out more information myself.) \"Revenge\" Maya: Why do you keep giving Nick the evil eye!? It doesn't matter if you prove the defendant guilty tomorrow... Nothing will be able to bring your dad back! von Karma: ... My... \"dad\"? You must mean the esteemed Manfred von Karma. (Changed from [My... Dad? You must mean the esteemed Manfred von Karma.] in the original release) Maya: Of course! Your dad! I know you miss him... von Karma: Enough out of you... One more word and you'll get a mouthful of whip. Now. When did I ever bring up my papa's name in this, or any other conversation...? Phoenix: !! Then... Then what's this \"revenge\" thing you're talking about? von Karma: You wouldn't understand, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I have to see \"him\" again, one more time. Phoenix: \"Him\"? von Karma: I'm sure you know to whom I refer... Miles Edgeworth!! Maya: What!? Edgeworth!? Mr... EDGEWORTH!? Phoenix: M-M-Mi-Miles E-Ed-Edg-Edgeworth!! Miles Edgeworth (appears after \"\"Revenge\"\") Phoenix: Miles Edgeworth... Why would you even bring him up!? von Karma: You haven't forgotten, have you? Do you know who it was that trained the gifted prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth? Maya: !! Manfred... von... Karma... von Karma: Exactly right. It was my papa. Maya: That means that Edgeworth was... von Karma: Right again. Miles was like a little brother to me. Maya: Huh? Little brother? Edgeworth and Nick are the same age... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... The man who inspired me to become an attorney. I fought against him in a few cases... But after \"that\" case was over... He \"vanished\"...) von Karma: It's your fault he is gone. Maya: HUH!? von Karma: It's the truth, isn't it, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I... I... Maya: Nick! What does she mean!? Edgeworth's death (appears after \"Miles Edgeworth\") Phoenix: Edgeworth was never quite the same after that case, and then, with the case after that one... (Changed from [After that case, Edgeworth was in a peculiar state, and he got worse everyday.] in the original release) He never set foot into court again... And then one day, he just vanished. All he left was a simple note at the prosecutor's office. von Karma: \"Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death.\" Phoenix: That was one year ago. It was a few months after you left to go back home. (Changed from [It was right after you left to go back home.] in the original release) Maya: Mr. Edgeworth... He's dead? von Karma: I don't believe it. He's still alive. I'm sure of it... Somewhere in this world, he's still alive. \"Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death?\" Of course he did! You ruined his reputation as a prosecutor! You effectively killed the prosecutor in him. Just like your victory muddied the honorable name Von Karma! I'm going to find him... And then, I'm going to teach him his rightful place with my own two hands! (Changed from [Then I'm going to teach him the difference between right and wrong with my own hands!] in the original release) Present Anything Maya: What about this? OWWW!! She hit me again. Phoenix: Maybe you should hold off on the wild goose chases. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: N-N-Nick! Umm... About Mr. Edgeworth...! (Changed from [N-N-Nick! Umm... About Edgeworth?] in the original release) Phoenix: Maya, I already told you this once. Don't make me do it again. Don't bring up his name in front of me again, OK? Maya: N-Nick...? Phoenix: Ms. von Karma? (Changed from [Von Karma?] in the original release) von Karma: What? Phoenix: I don't know if you are god's gift to prosecutors or not, but I've had about enough of you!! Him, too! Maya: Wha... What in the world happened...? (Changed from [Wha... What happened?] in the original release) von Karma: Hmph. This dog is all bark and no bite. He's already been defeated... Regardless, I have nothing to inform you two of today. Tomorrow will be the greatest courtroom battle this country has ever seen!! Maya: Nick? Phoenix: Let's go. We need to talk with the performer on the third floor. Maya: I'm sorry I brought it up, Nick... December 29Lodging Hall 3rd FloorAcro's Room ???: You must be Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes. ???: Pleased to meet you. I'm Ken Dingling. Acro: But here at the circus, everyone just calls me Acro. Maya: Mr... Acro. Phoenix: Ummm... How do you know my name? Acro: The detective told me. He said you'd definitely show up here. Maya: Acro, you're a member of this circus as well? Acro: That's right. I mainly performed on the tightrope or the flying trapeze. But nowadays... All I perform in is my wheelchair. Examine Junk pile Maya: Eww... It's a huge pile of trash! Phoenix: One man's trash is another monkey's treasure. Maya: I guess you're right. Look! They're all shiny things. Phoenix: He's even got a motorcycle exhaust. What do they call this thing? Oh... A tuba right? Maya: Of course it's a tuba, silly! You didn't know that!? Phoenix: Hey... It's a picture of Regina. Maya: Well, she is a shining beauty. Phoenix: No objections here. Calendar Maya: Hehe... It's a monkey calendar! Phoenix: Acro must really love monkeys. Talk Berry Big Circus Phoenix: Acro, why did you join the circus? Acro: When I was a kid, my parents failed miserably at business. Then one night, they decided to run away from it all... Without me. Maya: ...!! Acro: The only person who was willing to take my parents' place was the Ringmaster. (Changed from [The only person who was willing to take my parent's [sic] place was the Ringmaster.] in the original release) The Ringmaster took such incredible care of me. He was truly a lifesaver. Maya: It seems like the Ringmaster was truly a saint. Acro: He was... That's why I decided to do something very important. I decided that I would devote my entire life to finding a way to repay him... And now... Look how someone repaid him for all the good in his life!! Phoenix: It's such a shame. Acro: Sometimes I think that he was almost too kind... Perhaps he was too kind to his performers... Perhaps he was too kind to his daughter. Phoenix: (Hmm... I wonder if he spoiled Regina?) Maya: Regina is so cute!! She's truly a princess. Acro: Truly a princess? Are you sure that's a good thing? Maya: Umm... Phoenix: (Hmm... Do I detect a hint of a grudge against Regina...) Wheelchair Maya: Umm... I'm sorry to ask, but why are you in a wheel chair? Acro: The nerves in my legs were badly damaged. Phoenix: And you can't walk now? Acro: I can't even stand now. And since I live on the third floor, I can't even leave this building by myself. Maya: That's awful... Phoenix: The accident happened during an acrobatics session, right? Acro: Umm... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (A Psyche-Lock! It doesn't seem like Acro's injuries were acrobatic in nature...) Acro: What's on your mind, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Well... Exactly when were you injured? Acro: It's almost been six months since I was hurt. I injured my legs during practice. Phoenix: (Six months ago... What in the world went on at this circus then!?) Wheelchair (subsequent times) Acro: I'm still undergoing rehabilitation for my injuries. I still can't stand, but the doctor's* ([sic]) say that I'll be able to recover and walk again. Maya: Out of curiosity, what kind of accident was it again? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Acro: I don't really have much more to add beyond that. Phoenix: (Acro's hiding what really caused his \"accident\". Maybe it's related to what happened to the Ringmaster?) What happened Phoenix: I stopped by yesterday and noticed that you weren't in your room. Acro: I was at the hospital all day yesterday. Phoenix: Ahh... You went there for rehabilitation? What about the murder? Acro: Of course I knew about it... I spoke with the police before they allowed me to go to the hospital. Before I got the call from the prosecutor, I was convinced that it was all a dream. Maya: Huh? Acro: I just couldn't believe it. When I saw what I saw... Phoenix: \"What you saw\"...? (Jeez, that sounded really ominous...) What you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: What did you see, Acro? Acro: That night... I was in bed sleeping when I heard a huge sound coming from below my window. Maya: I see... The scene of the crime was right below your window. Acro: That's when I looked out the window... Maya: What did you see? Acro: He was flying straight up into the air... Phoenix: H-He? Acro: Maximillion Galactica. Maya: Whaaatttt!? Phoenix: (That's what I thought he'd say...) You're absolutely positive that it was Max you saw flying? Acro: I am absolutely sure. There's no doubt in my mind. Maya: N-Nick... Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Acro, please take a look at this photo for us... Acro: No problem... Ahh... This is how it ended for him... Such a shame... Phoenix: (He seems awfully calm... But his eyes have a look of sorrow and profound pain...) Acro: If my legs weren't like this... I would have been able to prevent this from happening! That's an absolute certainty! Maya: Acro... Silk Hat, Ringmaster's Papers, Max G. Promo Poster, Grand Prix Photo, or Max G. Bust Acro: Maximillion Galactica, right? You'll have to forgive me, but I try not to think about him. Phoenix: (Acro won't even look at it...) Maya: It looks like something is really weighing on him. Money the Monkey Acro: Heh... Money is a great friend to me. Phoenix: That pile of \"treasure\" over there is his collection, huh? Acro: It is indeed. Money will bring anything back with him. Maya: Aww... That's so cute! Acro: Yeah, I'm not great with the ladies... But I seem to be pretty popular with the animals. Note Acro: Hmm... What's this? Phoenix: That's what we want to know. Maya: It was posted in the cafeteria the morning before the murder. Acro: In the... Cafeteria? Phoenix: (W-What happened? He suddenly looks incredibly serious...) Acro: ... If it's got something to do with her, then you should go straight to the source. Maya: Her? Acro: Regina. Ask her about it. Max profile Acro: You want to know about Max? Well, his colleagues in the circus all seem to hate him. Phoenix: What about you, Acro? Acro: I've got my issues with him as well. But he just also happens to have a diamond shining in his soul. Maya: A diamond shining in his soul? Acro: I guess you could say it is his pride as a performer. We didn't have that pride in ourselves before Max arrived. Honestly, I think he brought something wonderful to this circus when he came. Maya: Acro... Phoenix: (This guy is really different from the other members of the circus...) Ben profile Phoenix: I was hoping you could shed some light on Ben... Acro: Well, he'll always be here. And as long as he's here, he really can only continue to be a ventriloquist. Whether that's a good thing for him or not... I'm afraid I can't really say. Franziska von Karma profile Acro: Mr. Wright. I just realized who you remind me of... You're just like this prosecutor. Phoenix: W-W-W-W-WHAT!? Acro: You and the prosecutor have the same glint in your eyes. Phoenix: Y-You're joking, right!? You think I'm like that whip carrying demon!? Acro: Whoa... No need to get so hostile about it. You two may view things from very different perspectives... for now. But you both see the world through the same color-tinted glasses. I know because when I look at people, their eyes are the only things I can believe in. Maya: Hmm... Nick and Von Karma, huh... Regina Berry profile Acro: Regina... Maya: She's cool, isn't she? And can you believe such a cute girl is an animal tamer!? Acro: It seems animals are not the only thing* ([sic]) she tames. Maya: Huh? Acro: Max, the Ringmaster, Ben... She's got them all under her thumb. Maya: W-Whaddya mean by that? Acro: Hmm... Maybe I went a bit overboard. It's just Regina's innocence. She was incredibly sheltered as a child. Maya: I'd say it seems that way. Acro: That's why she can be so cruel. Maya: What? Acro: Regina is just like the animals she claims to tame. She's innocent, thus she can be cruel. Phoenix: (I wonder what happened between Acro and Regina...) Russell Berry profile Acro: The Ringmaster... He was even more than a father to me. When he took me in, the circus was in bad shape. It was obvious that he had no real way of supporting us. Phoenix: (Who does he mean by us...?) Maya: Is that why you started with acrobatics? Acro: Back then, I was only nine years old. I begged the Ringmaster to let me try, and he finally gave in. Having a kid in the circus was probably the last thing in the world that he wanted... I just wanted to be helpful. So I could help the Ringmaster. Maya: That's such a nice story. Moe profile Acro: The Ringmaster really believed in Moe. One-hundred percent. What will happen to the circus now that the Ringmaster's gone...? The beginning of the Lawrence Curls era I suppose. Phoenix: (I wonder if it's really alright to let Moe run the show...) Acro: Mr. Wright, you don't know much about Moe, I suspect. Phoenix: You can see right through me. Maya: Aww Nick! You can't let him get to you like that! You're an attorney! Acro profile Acro: I can't believe what happened to the Ringmaster... Such a wonderful man... What a pity. I have no clue what to do with my life now. Maya: I'm sorry... Acro: This circus meant everything to me. But don't worry about me... There are still things that I have left to do in this world. Any other evidence Maya: What do you think of this!? Acro: I'm sorry, but in my present physical condition... I don't really know much about what goes on outside of this room. Maya: Oh... We're sorry... Acro: Don't worry about it. No need to apologize. Any other profiles Acro: Lately, I've been confined to this room, so I don't have a clue what's going on with the circus. Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Any other profiles Maya: That's not really important is it? Phoenix: Must you always be so blunt? After clearing all Talk options in Lodging Hall 3rd Floor - Acro's Room: December 29Berry Big CircusBig Top Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr... Phoenix: (I've got a bad feeling about this...) Grrrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!! Maya: YAAAH!! NICK!! Phoenix: (Wonderful... Today's special must be Filet O'Phoenix!) Regina: STAY! STAY! HEEL! Oh! Maya! Nick! It's you guys! I'm sorry... I guess I made a mistake. Phoenix: A m-m-mistake!? Regina: Yeah. A little one. I was thinking of teaching whatever primate was out there a lesson... But I was expecting more of a monkey than a human... Maya: A monkey? Talk Russell Berry Maya: It's a pity about what happened to the Ringmaster. Regina: Dad? Maya: Everyone loved him, didn't they? He must have been quite a man. Regina: He was!! I love my dad sooo much! Phoenix: (I hate to say it, but she doesn't seem all that broken up about her father...) Regina: That's why I feel so lonely. Now that I won't be able to see him for a while... Maya: For a while? Regina: Yeah. When L\u00e9on died, I talked with my dad, and he told me that... \"When someone dies, they just become a star in the heavens.\" Maya: A s-star? Regina: That means that my dad is looking down on me from the sky. That's why I love the night so much. I can see everyone who's gone. Phoenix: (\"When someone dies, they just become a star in the heavens.\" That's kinda sweet... But I bet you there's no way that Maya believes that...) Maya: What do you mean \"there's no way I believe that\"!? Regina: Do you think that one day... I'll be a star too? Maya: Of course! Regina: You really think so? Phoenix: Yeah... You will. I think... Regina: I've got a feeling that everyone is doing great up there in the sky! Phoenix: (I wonder if everything's alright with Regina...) Money the Monkey Maya: Just to go back up and clear something up... Why'd you want to teach Money a lesson? Regina: Because he's a meanie! He's got something that means a lot to me... Maya: Something that means a lot to you? It must be something shiny right? Regina: Umm... Actually... It's a stage costume. It's got lots of spangles... It's really beautiful, you should see it. Maya: We should? (Changed from [What are spangles?] in the original release) Regina: When the costume gets hit by the spotlight, it dazzles. Hey Mr. Attorney! Phoenix: Huh? Regina: If you saw that monkey, you'd get my dress back for me, wouldn't you? It's really important to me... Gladly! Leads to: \"Leave it all up to us!\" But of course! Leads to: \"Leave it all up to us!\" I'll get it for you! Leads to: \"Leave it all up to us!\" Maya: Leave it all up to us! Phoenix: (Guess there's no turning down that request...) (Changed from [There's no way I could turn down that request...] in the original release) Regina: Yay! You're really gonna do it!? Present Silk Hat, Max G. Promo Poster, Grand Prix Photo, or Max G. Bust Regina: There's no denying it... Max is cool. I wanna try flying someday! With Max!! Phoenix: (She's already flown off into her own little world...) Maya: Nick, I wanna try flying too! Phoenix: Uhh... OK. I'll think about it. Money the Monkey Regina: He just loves to cause nothing but trouble... That cute little monkey. Maya: But don't you think using a tiger to scare him is a bit much? Regina: Huh? Why's that? Maya: Do you really have to ask that!? It's dangerous to use a tiger for that kinda thing!! Regina: It's not dangerous at all. Regent's just a little kitten! Phoenix: (I've seen plenty of kittens... And that's no kitten.) Small Seasoning Bottle Regina: That's pepper, isn't it? From the cafeteria... Phoenix: Huh? It's from the cafeteria? Regina: It's not? I remember seeing it there. Phoenix: (Hmm... So this was the cafeteria's pepper...) Regina: You know, I'm not a big fan of pepper. Note Phoenix: Regina, have you ever seen this before? Regina: Uhh... I know what this is. Maya: R-Really!? Regina: Well, it was in my pocket for a while. Phoenix: I-It was in your pocket!? This piece of paper... Was in your pocket!? Regina: Hmm... I guess I noticed it was in there around breakfast time. Phoenix: Breakfast time? Regina: Yeah. I always take Acro his breakfast in the morning. That's when I also take out the trash in his room. Then I'd go to the cafeteria and eat my own breakfast... Maya: That's when you realized the piece of paper was in your pocket? Regina: Yep. But since I'm not a murderer, I just figured it belonged in someone else's pocket. Phoenix: And then what...? Regina: I wondered if the person who lost it was in trouble, so... Maya: You didn't put it on the bulletin board in the cafeteria, did you? Regina: I did! I stuck it up there. How'd you know...? Phoenix: Hmm... (So it was Regina who put it up there!) When did this happen? Regina: Umm... The morning of the murder. I think. Phoenix: (That explains a lot...) Regina: I wonder who wrote this... Note updated in the Court Record. Note (subsequent times) Regina: I wonder what they mean by murderer... It's like some sort of soap opera. It's kinda strange. Phoenix: (Strange is probably too nice of a word...) Max profile Regina: Hey Maya, do you know if Max is doing OK? Maya: Well... Umm... I don't think I'd go so far as to say he was OK... Regina: Aww... I hope he comes back here real soon. Maya: I'm sure he's going to come back here... Right, Nick? Regina: There's no way he will lose with you helping him... Right, Mr. Attorney? Phoenix: Umm... *gulp* Of course. If I'm Wright, you're right!! Russell Berry profile Regina: I might not be able to see my Dad for a while, but... I know I can wait until I see him again. Maya: That's the spirit. Even though he won't be coming home... Regina: Don't do that Maya. Please don't look at me that way. Maya: I-I'm s-s-sorry. Phoenix: (Regina's so cheerful... It kinda makes you wonder if all the lights are on... Especially when she says she won't be able to see her dad \"for a while\"...) Moe profile Regina: He's been a good friend to my dad for a really long time now. My dad always said... \"When it comes to who I can entrust the circus to, it's definitely Moe.\" Maya: Hmm... Yep! That clown is one lovable stooge. Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: Umm... No comment... Acro profile Regina: Ahh, it's Acro. Is he in his room today? Phoenix: Yes, he is. We just came back from meeting with him. Regina: I hope his legs get better soon. Acro's so incredible! Especially on the trapeze! Maya: The trapeze is that enormous swing hanging from the top of the tent, right? Regina: Yep, that's it! I really want to see him up there again... Acro the Acrobat. Phoenix: (That's strange... Acro doesn't seem to have very many nice things to say about Regina... But Regina seems to like Acro just fine.) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Note in Berry Big Circus - Big Top: December 29Big TopCafeteria Maya: Something smells fantastic! So we know it can't be Moe... Wait! I know what it is!! It's burgers!! Moe: Hello hello hello! Welcome to the Bistro du Cirque aka the cafeteria! Maya: Mmm... It smells so good in here... And those burgers look great! (Changed from [Mmm... It smells so good in here... Those burgers look great!] in the original release) Phoenix: (She's drooling like she's some sort of crazed burger monster!) Moe: My burgers are the best!! Juicy meat... Toasted buns... Special sauce... They are absolutely irresistible to anyone with a hankering for a burger! One bite will send you into hamburger heaven! Maya: I bet! I can tell by the smell. Phoenix: (Whoa... I'm getting hungry too! Those burgers must have some kind of special power!) Talk Berry Big Circus Maya: Now that the Ringmaster is gone, what are you going to do? Moe: That's all I've thought about the past two days... Everyone loved Russell... You've heard Acro's story, haven't you? Phoenix: Like how he was adopted when he was younger? Moe: He's calmed down a bit now, but he was livid when he heard about the murder. (Chagned from [He's calmed down a bit now, but when the murder happened he was livid.] in the original release) Acro was so upset that he said he couldn't go on. Phoenix: He was that upset? Moe: Yes he was... Anyways, I gave it some thought. Maybe I should give up on trying to be a half-baked clown... I've been thinking of trying on the Ringmaster's shoes... Maya: What!? Really!? Moe: Max would still be an issue though... Maya: Max? Moe: He may be a bit mean and hard to work with, but it's hard to argue his importance. He's probably the reason the circus is still around... A lot of what he says is right. Maya: Moe... Moe: All that's left is to see if everyone would get over the tragedy... You know... Phoenix: (The tragedy? You know? What is he talking about?) \"Get over it\"? (appears after \"Berry Big Circus\") Phoenix: \"Get over\" what tragedy, Moe? Moe: Huh!? Don't worry about it... It's nothing. Nothing at all. Maya: He must mean the tragic death of the Ringmaster, right? Moe: Yes Yes! That's it! You're right, girlie! Dang! Dang! Dang! Correct-o-mundo!! Phoenix: (Doesn't he mean \"ding\"?) Moe... I mean no disrespect here, but... Are you lying to us? Moe: Egghhh... No! Not at all! What makes you think that!? Phoenix: Just the way you said \"if everyone can get over the tragedy\" seemed a bit strange. (Changed from [Just the way you said 'if everyone would get over it' seemed a bit strange.] in the original release) It sounded like you were talking about something from a long time ago. Moe: Eek eek eek eek eek. Phoenix: Moe! I'm right!! Aren't I!? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... So now we're getting closer to the truth.) Moe: It was about six months ago... It was just a little accident... Give me a break... Us old men have accidents. I wear big pants for a reason! Phoenix: (Six months ago, eh...) \"Get over it\"? (subsequent times) Phoenix: C'mon Moe. Tell us what happened six months ago. 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Moe: I'm kinda busy right now. Look... I'm eating a burger as we speak! Maya: Mmm... That looks so tasty! Phoenix: (I just wish we could do something about Moe chewing with his mouth open...) Present Note Moe: Let's see here. \"To The Murderer!\"... That's far from polite. Where did you find the rest of this note anyway? Phoenix: (Maybe it'd be best if I didn't tell Moe where we found it...) Don't worry about it, Moe. Moe: If I didn't need to worry about it, you shouldn't have shown it to me!! Acro profile Moe: He's always been a very private guy. When he came here, he was only about 10 years old. We had just started the Berry Big Circus around the time that Russell took him in. These are really hard memories to bring up... Maya: Acro was so happy to have joined the circus... Phoenix: He was especially grateful to the Ringmaster... And I'm sure he is grateful to you too. Moe: Huh? He's grateful to me too? Aww... Shucks. You guys are exaggerating. Phoenix: (He's fidgeting around so much, you can tell that he's embarrassed.)

Time to take on this monkey, attorney-style!) Give it back, monkey-brain! Phoenix: Give it back, monkey-brain! Money: Oooo-Ooooo-Ooooh! Phoenix: That means a lot to Regina!! A real man wouldn't make a little girl cry!! Money: Oo-Oo-Oo-Oo-Oooh! Maya: Yikes!! Phoenix: WAAHHH!! Phoenix: I tried to have a man-to-man talk with him... I really did. Maya: You know... Man-to-man isn't really accurate. It was more like man-to-monkey. Leads to: \"Nick! You... You...\" Stay! Phoenix: Stay! Money! Stay! Money: Oo-Ooooh? Phoenix: Hey, it's working!! Maya: Umm... It sounded like he was confused at the end of that \"Ooooh\". Phoenix: Stay... AHHHH!! Money: Oooooo-Oo-Oooh! Maya: Yikes!! Phoenix: WAAHHH!! Phoenix: I knew that acting like Regina would do the trick! Leads to: \"Nick! You... You...\" Ooo-oo-ooh! *scratch, scratch* Phoenix: Oooh-Oooh-Oh-Oh! Money: Oo-Ooooh? Phoenix: Wa-Oooh-Oooh!!

You're really on the ball today, Nick!] in the original release) Lemme see it... Lemme see it!! Phoenix: Huh? You can see it fine from where you are. Maya: You know what I mean! I really want to try on Regina's costume! (Exclamation marks were ellipses in the original release) Phoenix: (Maybe then they'll take you in at the circus and I can get some peace and quiet...) Maya: Hmm... Phoenix: What's the matter now? Maya: It doesn't fit me at all! Phoenix: Oh well, guess it's time for you to lay off the burgers! Not to mention it doesn't look like something any girl I know would actually wear. Stage Costume added to the Court Record. Big Top Talk L\u00e9on (appears after presenting Stage Costume) Phoenix: L\u00e9on... He was killed, wasn't he? Regina: That's right. My dad killed him. Maya: Why!? Regina: Well... L\u00e9on did something really bad during practice. Phoenix: During practice? Regina: L\u00e9on was sitting down, and then he opened his mouth. You know... GAAAWWW... Maya: Uh huh. Uh huh. Regina: Usually when he did that, I would put my head into his mouth. Maya: Uh huh. Uh huh... Wait... You put your HEAD into a lion's MOUTH!? Regina: I sure did. The people in the crowd always loved seeing me do that! They'd always start screaming! Phoenix: (You sure they were screaming because they loved seeing you do that!?) Anyways... What was the \"bad thing\"? Regina: Oh yeah. L\u00e9on bit someone during that practice. Maya: R-R-Regina!! Everything was alright though right? Regina: No, it wasn't alright... That was the problem. My dad was incredibly angry. Phoenix: And that's when L\u00e9on... Regina: Yeah. That's when he became a star in the sky. Phoenix: Poor thing... L\u00e9on has been added to the Court Record. L\u00e9on (subsequent times) Phoenix: L\u00e9on... He was killed, wasn't he? Regina: That's right. My dad killed him. Maya: Why!? Regina: Well... L\u00e9on did something really bad during practice. Phoenix: During practice? Regina: L\u00e9on was sitting down, and then he opened his mouth. You know... GAAAWWW... Maya: Uh huh. Uh huh.

Regina: YAY! THANK YOU!! YOU REALLY GOT IT BACK FOR ME!! Phoenix: Don't mention it. Regina: I love you, Mr. Attorney! Phoenix: *blush* It's... nothing... (No wonder guys melt to mush in front of this girl...) Maya: Hey Regina. That costume is yours right? I tried it on, but it didn't fit me... Regina: Huh? This costume? This isn't mine. It was L\u00e9on's. Phoenix: L\u00e9on's? Maya: You know... The lion she told us about. Phoenix: (Ohh... The one that someone killed.) Big Top - Cafeteria Talk \"Get over it\"? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Moe: It's just like you said. You know... The accident. Maya: Did someone... die? Moe: No, but it would have probably been better if he had. Phoenix: What!? How would that have been better!? Moe: He's still alive... But when he got bit, he suffered massive brain damage. He'll never recover from the coma that he's in... Maya: Coma...? Moe: All he does now is lie in his bed at the hospital. (Changed from [All he does now is lay in his bed at the hospital.] in the original release) And that's all he's ever going to be able to do... Maya: I see... Phoenix: How is he related to Acro? Moe: He's his brother. Phoenix: Huh? Moe: The person who got bit was Acro's brother. Maya: B-Brother? Moe: They were an acrobat team of brothers, Acro and Bat. Cute nicknames, I thought... Anyways, they were an incredible team... Cut down together in their prime... (Changed from [Anyways, they were an incredible team... Cut down at the same time...] in the original release) Acro's brother (appears after \"\"Get over it\"?\") Maya: Umm... Who is Acro's younger brother? Moe: Sean Dingling... But everyone always called him Bat. He fell in love with Regina. Trying to win her love was his downfall. Phoenix: (Everyone seems to fall in love with Regina...) Moe: Six months ago... While we were practicing... All of a sudden Bat blurts out, \"Let me perform with L\u00e9on!\" Maya: Why'd he do that? Moe: I don't know. But that's what caused the accident. I'll never forget that moment... It was so strange... L\u00e9on had the weirdest look on his face. He was... Smiling. Maya: He? You mean L\u00e9on? Moe: Yes. L\u00e9on. When he bit down, he was smiling. Some sick grin... Maya: No way!! That's impossible!! Phoenix: (A smirking lion... A flying murderer... Why does it seem that it's always Moe who catches all of these incredible events?) Maya: Nick? Can lions smile? Phoenix: Umm... Moe: We never told the police about the incident. The circus would have shut down if we had. The next day, the Ringmaster took L\u00e9on out and shot him with a rifle. Maya: So that's what really happened... Moe: Well... You guys were so serious! What was I supposed to do!? I had to tell you! But all this truthfulness has put me in the mood for a burger! Here... You two have some pepper! *shaka shaka shaka shaka* Phoenix: (There he goes again, acting like his normal crazy self...) Maya: Ahh... Ahh... Ahh... *Achoo!* *Achoo!* Moe: Nice! What a wonderful sneeze!! Maya: Huh? You think so? Moe: You sneeze with pepper and slip on a banana... That's basic clownsmanship. (Changed from [You sneeze with pepper and slip on a banana peel... That's basic clownsmanship.] in the original release) Girlie, I know you \"Gotti\" understand that!! Maya: Nick! I think I'd make a good clown! Moe: Other than Regina, I've never seen a cuter sneezer! Maya: Heh, heh! Does Regina sneeze with pepper, too? Moe: She does! Bat would always tease her with pepper! Maya: B-Bat? Moe: From my point of view, those two always looked so perfect together... Maya: They looked perfect together, huh? Acro's brother (subsequent times) Maya: Umm... Who is Acro's younger brother? Moe: Sean Dingling... But everyone always called him Bat. He fell in love with Regina. Trying to win her love was his downfall. Phoenix: (Everyone seems to fall in love with Regina...)

Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- \"Get Over It\"? -- Phoenix: Moe, please tell us what happened six months ago. What in the world went on at this circus? Moe: OK, OK... There's no need to look so scary when you ask me. Hey! Look over there! Some juicy burgers! Let's eat instead!! Phoenix: Unfortunately, I'm more of a grilled chicken sandwich man myself. Moe: Uhhh... Phoenix: Actually... I've kinda got an idea of what happened back then. Moe: !! Phoenix: Moe, you said something about an accident? This wouldn't happen to be the cause of that accident, would it? Present L\u00e9on Phoenix: Leads to: \"I heard a little bit about it from Regina.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: What about this!? Moe: Looks tasty!! Phoenix: W-What!? Moe: You know!! The burgers!! Phoenix: (It looks like I shot a blank on that attempt...) Moe: Whaddya say? Another burger sound alright to you? Leads back to: \"Moe, you said something about an accident?\" Phoenix: I heard a little bit about it from Regina. L\u00e9on made a mistake during a performance, right? Moe: How did you--!? (Changed from [Whattttttt!?] in the original release) 1 LOCK BROKEN Moe: ... I told them so many times... \"You shouldn't be doing such dangerous acts!\" (Changed from ['You shouldn't be doing dangerous performances like that!'] in the original release) Phoenix: Like putting her head inside L\u00e9on's mouth, right? (Changed from [Putting their head inside of L\u00e9on's mouth was part of a act!?] in the original release) Moe: But Regina believed in L\u00e9on. She believed so strongly that the Ringmaster went along... He could never say no to her. Phoenix: Out of curiosity, who was bitten? Moe: ... Phoenix: Come on, Moe! Don't clam up on me now. Who did L\u00e9on bite on the head? Moe: Well... Umm... I promised I wouldn't say anything. Phoenix: You promised? Moe: He's involved in this too. Phoenix: (He's \"involved\" huh? Moe must be talking about...) Moe. Is this the person that you promised you wouldn't say anything? Present Acro profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It must have been Acro, right?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Moe: Oooowoooahhhh!! Phoenix: What's the matter? Moe: There's a lot of spice on this Cajun burger! Phoenix: Umm... What about the person who you promised to keep silent? Leads back to: \"He's involved in this too.\" Phoenix: It must have been Acro, right? Moe: H-H-H-How... How'd you know? Phoenix: Don't worry about that, Moe. Getting to the bottom of this accident may help solve what happened to the Ringmaster. Moe: No... No way. Phoenix: I need to know the truth about what happened to Russell. Please tell me what you know. Moe: ... I'm sorry, Acro... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful L\u00e9on Moe: You wouldn't know it but I was responsible for naming all the animals at the circus. Maya: You named Money the Monkey? And Regent, Regina's tiger? Moe: Guilty as charged. But L\u00e9on got his name from the Ringmaster. Maya: Really? Moe: He always said \"keep names simple and easy to associate\". Maya: Nick's name is simple and easy to associate, right Wright? Moe: I always told Russell \"If that's what you think, then call him Lyin' the Lion!\" I's a great name, don't you think? Imagine if he could talk... \"I'm Lyin'!\" Aha! Aha! Maya: Lyin'... Moe: But that's when Russell said, \"Don't lie to yourself. That name is awful.\" Bat's profile Moe: When you think about it, he really was a good guy. He truly liked Regina, He would try anything to get her attention. Maya: He seems like a good guy. Moe: Back then, Acro was always laughing... Maya: But I guess that everything backstage at the circus isn't always rosy... Phoenix: I see. Moe: It's harder than you think, making people laugh all the time. Acro's Room (after clearing \"Acro's brother\" Talk option in Big Top - Cafeteria) Acro: Ahh... Mr. Wright. Back again I see. Maya: Well, he did say, \"I'll be back.\" Wait... or was that someone else? Phoenix: (We're back because Acro's hiding why his legs were injured! He was hurt in the accident six months ago! It would seem that he knows that we know...) Acro: Well well... It seems you've got things you want to talk about, so fire away. Talk Wheelchair (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Acro: My legs were injured by L\u00e9on. Six months ago. My younger brother, Bat, had a dare with Regina. Maya: A dare? Acro: An absurd dare. \"If I can put my head inside of L\u00e9on's mouth like you do... You have to go to the movies with me on a date.\" Maya: That's insane!! Didn't he know how dangerous that is!? Acro: We all thought he was being stupid too... But that lion was very old to begin with, and age brought with it countless experience in doing that very trick. Unfortunately, this particular time, I guess L\u00e9on wasn't ready or willing. Phoenix: And that's when the accident happened? Acro: He just wanted to take her out... To the movies... Maya: Poor Bat... Acro: When L\u00e9on chomped down, I jumped towards him. Then L\u00e9on attacked me and that's how I ended up... Maya: What about Bat? Acro: He's still in a coma. I went to the hospital yesterday to visit him. Maya: I see... Acro: I'm still waiting for him to open his eyes again... And that's the reason why I keep going. Regina and Bat (appears after \"Wheelchair\") Leads to: \"Bat and Regina...\" Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- About the Wheelchair -- Phoenix: I have to ask you, how were you injured? Acro: I'm sorry, I thought we talked about this? It was an accident that happened during practice. Phoenix: An accident during practice? Acro: Yes. Unfortunately acrobats are prone to all sorts of injuries. Phoenix: (He's lying... If that were the real cause, he'd have no reason to keep it a secret.) Acro, are you really telling me that a practice accident was the cause of your injury? Present L\u00e9on Phoenix: Leads to: \"L\u00e9on...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Alright Acro... Just tell me the truth. Acro: Do you mind if I ask you a question first? Phoenix: What do you want to know? Acro: Do you really think I could get an injury like this from something like that? Phoenix: (Yikes! It seems I'm off-track with this one...) Acro: If that's how you handle yourself, I suggest a net if you ever try the tightrope. Phoenix: (He's right. I slipped up just now... I've got to rethink things.) Leads back to: \"An accident during practice?\" Acro: L\u00e9on... Phoenix: Six months ago, you were attacked by the lion. That's when you were injured. Acro: ... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (I know I'm on the right track. I just need to keep going...) Acro: You're saying that I was attacked? By a lion!? Phoenix: That's what I'm saying. Acro: I'm sorry Mr. Wright, but I'm an acrobat. I'm no animal tamer... If a lion was coming for me, I'd be running for the exit. Phoenix: OK, maybe \"attacked\" is not the best word to be using. (Changed from [I'm not sure if \"attack\" is the best word to be using.] in the original release) So let me rephrase that as... \"battled\" the lion. (Changed from [You must have... battled the lion.] in the original release) Acro: You seem to enjoy telling jokes... Why would I decide to battle a lion? Phoenix: Because you had to fight it. You had to fight it to save someone. Present Bat profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Bat...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: So how about it, Acro? Acro: You mind if I ask one question first? Phoenix: Go ahead. What do you want to know? Acro: Why would I possibly battle the king of the jungle for something like that? Phoenix: Huh? (I must be going in the wrong direction.) Acro: Mr. Wright, I assure you that it would take more than that to get me to go after a lion. Leads back to: \"You seem to enjoy telling jokes... Why would I decide to battle a lion?\" Acro: Bat... Phoenix: It was a shame what happened to your brother six months ago. Acro: ... Phoenix: You tried to save him, didn't you? And that's how you got that terrible injury. Acro: ... 1 LOCK BROKEN Acro: Moe... He must have told you... Phoenix: Yes, we learned about Bat from Moe. But he didn't mention anything about you in regards to the accident. I suppose it was just a slip of the tongue on his part. That's how I figured it out. Acro: A slip of the tongue? Moe: Anyways, they were an incredible team... Cut down together in their prime... (Changed from [Anyways, they were an incredible team... Cut down at the same time...] in the original release) Phoenix: \"Cut down at the same time...\" That was where he slipped, and that's how I figured it out. You two ended up wrapped up in the same accident... together, like always. (Ellipsis not present in the original release) Acro: I see... But an accident is an accident. It wasn't anyone's fault... Phoenix: (I still haven't broken Acro's last Psyche-Lock... (Changed from [I still haven't broken Acro's Psyche-Lock...] in the original release) This must be one incredibly deep-seated secret... (Changed from [He must have an incredibly deep seeded secret...] in the original release)) \"It wasn't anyone's fault...\" Do you care to explain more? Acro: ... Phoenix: Acro, I know you are still hiding something from me... Maybe someone you don't seem to like much is the reason you're being evasive. (Changed from [Maybe something you don't seem to like much is the reason you're being evasive.] in the original release) Present Regina Berry profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"R-Regina...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: What about this, Acro? Acro: Are you aware how strange you seem sometimes? You seem to think you know what will happen before you do... But you're wrong. Phoenix: What? Acro: It's clear you haven't come to grips with what's going on. Phoenix: (Argh! There's no way I can back pedal away from this...) Leads back to: \"Acro, I know you are still hiding something from me...\" Acro: R-Regina... Phoenix: You always seem calm and collected, until you start talking about her. Saying things like she is \"cruel\"... Acro: Well done, Mr. Attorney. You've got quite the set of eagle eyes. Phoenix: You know... Her tiger tried to attack me... Acro: Regent tried to attack you? Phoenix: Twice. Acro: Hah hah hah... He wasn't serious I'm sure... You're not trying to insinuate that I believe she spurred on L\u00e9on to attack Bat, are you? Phoenix: ... Acro: L\u00e9on was never taught a command to attack people. Regina isn't capable of doing anything like that. Besides, Regina had no reason to want to hurt my little brother. Regina and Bat were such good friends back then... Phoenix: But you still hate Regina! I've got proof of it! Acro: What!? What are you talking about!? Phoenix: (Doh! Maybe I overdid it again... But if I can hand something over to Acro, maybe it'll...) Here's proof that you had it out for Regina all along! Present Note Phoenix: Leads to: \"T-This... Where'd you get it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Acro: ... Phoenix: Acro? Acro: You know, I think I hate you more than I ever hated her. Phoenix: Huh? Acro: How could what you just showed me possibly prove that I hate Regina? Phoenix: Uhhh... (It looks like I picked the wrong piece of evidence... But there's gotta be something that works... I know it...) Leads back to: \"Here's proof that you had it out for Regina all along!\" Acro: T-This... Where'd you get it? Phoenix: Regina posted it on the bulletin board in the cafeteria. Before that, it was in her pocket. Regina: Hmm... I guess I noticed it was in there around breakfast time. I always take Acro his breakfast in the morning. Phoenix: You wrote this, and then you put it in her pocket... That's right, isn't it? Acro: ... That's right. Well done Mr. Wright... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Phoenix: Bat and Regina... Acro: They were such great friends. Oh yeah... I wanted you to take a look at this. Phoenix: What is it? Acro: This is the scarf my brother was wearing when L\u00e9on attacked him. Maya: Gross... It's covered in blood. Acro: This scarf... It was a present from Regina to my brother on the day of the accident. (Changed from [Was a present from Regina to my brother on the day of the accident.] in the original release) Phoenix: Hmm... Acro: When he did it, he looked like he was smiling... Phoenix: He? Acro: L\u00e9on, obviously. Maya: Oh! (Changed from [What!?] in the original release) Acro: When he bit down on Bat's head... The expression on L\u00e9on's face looked like a grin. Maya: Nick! Phoenix: I know!! Moe said the same thing... Maya: What do you think it all means? ???: I'll be taking that scarf if you don't mind... Phoenix: Ms. von Karma? (Changed from [Von Karma?] in the original release) von Karma: I've already heard everything! So hand over the scarf. Maya: But the scarf is evidence in the trial! von Karma: That is for me to decide. I think we should begin our preparations now, Acro. Phoenix: Preparations? von Karma: I've served a summons on Acro to appear in court tomorrow as a witness. Acro, we'll talk more at the Prosecutor's Office. ([Prosecutor's Office] lowercase in the original release) Maya: Acro... A witness!? von Karma: Come Acro. Let's go to the office. Acro: Yes, ma'am. Maya: Now what do we do, Nick? How are we going to handle tomorrow? Phoenix: Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out... Maya: Look at you all full of confidence!! You must have found something you can use! Phoenix: (This is all beginning to come together now...) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- What You Witnessed --Acro: It was just after 10:00 PM, and I was resting in my bed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You said that you were resting in bed. One would thus assume that you turned the lights off in your room, correct? Acro: That's correct. But there are safety lights around the outside of the lodging house. It's so bright, sometimes it can make it hard to sleep... Judge: If that's the case, wouldn't it be a good idea to close some curtains? Acro: ... I never really thought of that. I guess that means I'm off to buy some curtains. Judge: Hah hah... Sometimes I do make myself useful in these chambers. OWWW!! von Karma: The witness will proceed with his testimony!Acro: Around that time, I heard a large \"THUMP\" noise from outside the window.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Your room is on the third floor, right? Acro: Yes. Phoenix: And you said that you were resting in bed. Acro: That is correct. Phoenix: But you were still able to hear a sound from outside? Acro: I was indeed. Phoenix: (Pressing Acro doesn't seem to get results... Hmm... Maybe something was contradictory with what he just said...) There's nothing wrong. Judge: What's the matter, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: N-N-Nothing, Your Honor. (Until I can find a clear contradiction... I should tread lightly.) von Karma: ... Leads back to cross-examination There is a contradiction.

Right by my window.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was a human being? It could've been a mannequin, or perhaps a large action figure... Acro: Hmm... Well, setting aside the possibility of a mannequin, an action figure is plausible... von Karma: You have no need to mince words with Mr. Phoenix Wright. Testify the truth and only the truth. Just as if we were there with you that night... Acro: I believe it was a human. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (Damn... I just strengthened his testimony...

I only saw him from behind, but that's who it looked like.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The light in your room was turned off then, right? Acro: That's true. I was going to bed after all... Phoenix: So with the lights off, you were still able to clearly see a human fly by your window? Acro: The safety lights lit things up enough for me to see. But honestly, there was only enough light for me to see the silhouette outside my window. It was the person's back, so I couldn't see the white roses on the front. Judge: Did you see any of the other symbols? Acro: I clearly saw the silk hat, as well as the cloak wrapped around his body. I'm convinced that the person I saw was Max Galactica. Judge: Hmm...

Now the challenge will be to expose his lies in court.Maya: Well, put the pedal to the metal, Nick!Phoenix: You claim to have seen the exact same thing Moe saw that night. Do you stand by that?Acro: What do you mean...?Phoenix: The silk hat.Acro: What about the silk hat? I saw it on Max's head as he flew by my window.Phoenix: Well... You should have tried looking down out of your window that night.Acro: That would have been quite difficult considering the state that I'm in. Just looking outside of the window was a tough enough challenge for me.Phoenix: That's a shame, because you would have noticed the silk hat found on the scene.Acro: That... That's the Ringmaster's hat... Right?Phoenix: Afraid not. No matter how you look at it, this is Max's silk hat.Judge: Where are you going with this, Mr. Wright? Are you saying that Max has two silk hats!?Phoenix: No. This is a handmade, one-of-a-kind model made only for Maximillion Galactica. Which means, Acro... That you've been fibbing on the stand!Judge: Order! Order!von Karma:von Karma: As always, it looks like someone just had to open their mouth before thinking... (Changed from [Like always, someone has to open their mouth before thinking...] in the original release)Maya: Are you OK, Nick?Phoenix: Well, I opened my big mouth, and now I have to back it up...Judge: How about it, Mr. Wright? What would cause this witness to commit perjury in this court today?He has a grudge against Max. Phoenix: Perhaps it is because Acro has a grudge agains the defendant! Which is why he is trying to frame Max... Judge: OWWW!! Why me!? What'd I do!? von Karma: Never get your fat head in the way of a whip bent on finding justice! Mr. Phoenix Wright... I have no interest in your silly little theories! He has a grudge against the defendant, huh? You wouldn't happen to have proof of that? Phoenix: Well... Umm... That's the thing... Judge: Mr. Wright! Thanks to you, I got my head lashed by Ms. von Karma's whip! I don't like getting hit for nothing, so how about you answer with an explanation! Leads back to: \"Are you OK, Nick?\"Acro was dreaming. Phoenix: It's obvious that what Acro saw, he didn't actually see at all, because it was a dream! von Karma: von Karma: So you plan on writing off all the inconvenient facts as nothing but dreams? Maybe you should just pinch your cheeks and see if you are actually awake. Phoenix: OWWW!! (I think your whip proved this isn't a dream just fine...) Judge: Mr. Wright! How about you provide an answer that actually explains things! Leads back to: \"Are you OK, Nick?\"Acro is the real culprit. Leads to: \"... Your Honor!\"Phoenix: ... Your Honor! On this occasion, the defense accuses Acro himself!von Karma: \"On this occasion\"...?Judge: \"A-A-Accuses Acro\"!? What in the world are you accusing him of?Phoenix: Obviously we accuse him of the murder of Mr. Russell Berry!Judge: Mr. Wright, are you serious!?Phoenix: Deadly serious, Your Honor.von Karma: Ha ha ha... I think your trips to the circus have served you well... You seem to have learned how to try and grab at an audience's hearts and minds. (Changed from [You seem to remember how to try and grab at an audience's hearts and minds.] in the original release)Phoenix: ...!!von Karma: Your Honor. Don't allow yourself to be swayed by theatrics. Trying to wow the crowd with smoke and mirrors is the oldest bluff in the book.Judge: R-Really...?von Karma: If you don't believe me, just look at the witness. He's calm enough for it to almost be scary...Phoenix: (Hmm... He is staying rather calm and collected...)Judge: Mr. Dingling, do you have any response to the defense's accusation?Acro: I don't really need to say a thing, do I?Judge: What do you mean?Acro: Everyone, take a good look at me. I can't even stand up by myself, let alone leave the lodging house.Judge: T-That's true...Acro: I understand that Mr. Wright is just trying to help his client. But to do this by accusing me of a murder of all things...von Karma: See! Even a sliver of common sense makes it clear the accusation is ludicrous! (Changed from [See! Even a silver [sic] of common sense makes it clear the accusation is ludicrous!] in the original release)She's right! Way to pick on the disabled you heartless, cruel man!Phoenix is a poopyhead!!von Karma: See that, Mr. Phoenix Wright? If you're trying to drum up support from the peanut gallery, that's how you do it.Phoenix: Uhh...von Karma: I think that's enough of this little game. I've got a doctor's note to confirm that Acro is unable to stand under his own power. Maybe the defense is planning on making a claim to counter this as well? I can hear the defense now... \"Acro had an accomplice!!\"Judge: What do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?Of course he did. Phoenix: It's impossible for Acro to be the murderer in this case. If that's the case, then it's natural for one to consider possible accomplices! Judge: Hmm... You don't say... Phoenix: (Not good... Not good... This isn't going to end well.) von Karma: Don't tell me you think you're gonna get off easy. Phoenix: W-WHAT!? von Karma: You must not have heard that sound just now... Maybe it wasn't clear enough... The sound of you falling into your own trap can be hard to notice sometimes! Judge: Mr. Wright... It seems as if you won't be stopping at Acro, but will be making other accusations. If Acro did not have an accomplice, things are not looking good for you! Phoenix: I understand, Your Honor. *gulp* Judge: Very well... Let's continue. Who, perchance, would happen to be Acro's accomplice? Present anything Phoenix: Judge: You... You don't say! Phoenix: (Uh oh... This is suddenly looking very very bad...) von Karma: Don't tell me you think you're gonna get off easy. Phoenix: W-W-W-WHAT!? von Karma: Oh... Did you hear that? Phoenix: Hear what? von Karma: The sound of you getting caught in your own trap! What a splendid accomplice. I'm sure this accusation is built on a solid foundation. Phoenix: Foundation... Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright... Do you have proof that this person you've accused was indeed an accomplice? Present anything Phoenix: Judge: ... Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor? Judge: This piece of evidence is lacking in persuasive power. von Karma: You didn't miss that sound, did you Mr. Phoenix Wright? You know... The sound of you receiving a penalty!! Phoenix: (Arrrrghhhh!) Maya: What are you doing, Nick!? Leads back to: \"What do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?\"Of course he didn't. Leads to: \"Now then, this must be when we get to hear the name of the mystery accomplice!\"von Karma: Now then, this must be when we get to hear the name of the mystery accomplice!Phoenix: Not this time, Von Karma.von Karma: Wh... WHAT!?Phoenix: You're not going to sucker me into this one.Judge: What are you blabbering about, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: There was no accomplice! Acro planned and committed this murder all by himself!Judge: O-Order! Order! What the... What are you getting at!?Maya: Way to keep them on their toes, Nick!Phoenix: Now I'm going to have to prove how it all fits together... I have to show how Acro murdered Russell Berry.Maya: Can you do it Nick? Can you really do that!?Phoenix: I know what I can't do. I can't stop now... If I stop attacking, I'm doomed!Maya: Alright! Then let's do it!!von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright... If this witness is the killer, then his eyewitness account is all lies, right?Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me... When the crime was committed, exactly where was Mr. Dingling?Present Acro's room Phoenix: Leads to: \"He was obviously here the entire time.\"Present plaza Phoenix: Phoenix: There is no way he was anywhere but exactly right here! Judge: In the plaza? He was at the scene of the crime itself? You're right though... The murderer would have had to have met the victim... von Karma: Phoenix: OWWW!! Judge: Ms. von Karma! Stop it!! You will be quiet and refrain from striking people! von Karma: The witness could not have possibly left the lodging house on his own! Not to mention what Mr. Phoenix Wright just said! \"There was no accomplice!\" remember? Phoenix: Yeah... Um... You're right. You think I could get another chance? Judge: Wait just one minute. Don't forget about my proverbial whip as well. Phoenix: (Arrrrgh!) Leads back to: \"Hmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me...\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: He was right here! Judge: What!? That location is completely unrelated to the crime... But I suppose if you said he was in his room, he wouldn't have been able to commit... von Karma: Phoenix: OWWW!! Judge: Ms. von Karma! Stop it!! You will be quiet and refrain from striking people! von Karma: The witness could not have possibly left the lodging house on his own! Not to mention what Mr. Phoenix Wright just said! \"There was no accomplice!\" remember? Phoenix: Yeah... Um... You're right. You think I could get another chance? Judge: Wait just one minute. Don't forget about my proverbial whip as well. Phoenix: (Arrrrgh!) Leads back to: \"Hmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me...\"Phoenix: He was obviously here the entire time.Judge: That's... Acro's room?Phoenix: Pretty simple, eh? Acro wasn't able to leave the lodging house by himself. In that case, there can be only one correct answer! (Changed from [There's only one answer to that...] in the original release) Acro didn't leave his room to kill the Ringmaster!von Karma: What!? Are you nuts!?Judge: What say you, Mr. Dingling!?Acro: ... It's an interesting theory.Phoenix: ... Umm... That's it?Acro: Considering that what you proposed is impossible, yes, that's it.Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.Judge: As the witness has stated... Your assertion is impossible. As he is in a wheelchair, there is no way he could go to the scene or be the killer.Phoenix: Hmm... You've got a point.von Karma: It seems you've forgotten once again, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The defendant was clearly spotted at the scene of the crime.Maya: That's true! Moe said that he saw Max, didn't he?Phoenix: But Maya, it's still impossible for humans to fly.Acro: Do you mind if I ask a question, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: What is it?Acro: I understand some of your logic... However, how do you think that I killed him? If I can't leave my room, I obviously couldn't wear Max's costume...Phoenix: (Hmm... How did he do it? That's the next course of this legal buffet...)Maya: Be careful, Nick. If you mess up here...Phoenix: (She's right. I can't mess up here. I've gotta give this one some serious thought! I'm sure that Acro killed the Ringmaster... And he did it while he was in his room... No doubt about it! (Changed from [And he killed the Ringmaster while he was in his room... No doubt about it!] in the original release))Judge: Time to enlighten us as to how Mr. Dingling committed the crime, Mr. Wright!Present evidence Leads to: \"I'm going to present some evidence!\"Can't present evidence now von Karma: Ahh... I think we will finally be graced with an explanation! Phoenix: Don't push it, Von Karma! von Karma: Wha... WHAT!? Phoenix: You aren't gonna suck me in this time. I'm smart enough to know when I don't have the cards to play and my hand sucks right now. Judge: ... Uhh... What do you mean, Mr. Wright? von Karma: He means that everything he's said up until now has all been nonsense. Phoenix: Uh. von Karma: It's true, right? If you can't establish proof of your murder theory, then it's nonsense! Phoenix: Uhhh... von Karma: He's trying to fool us by playing some misdirection game. Phoenix: (It looks like this isn't going to pass muster...) Maya: Nick! You've gotta show them some evidence! Phoenix: Easier said than done... Judge: So what will it be, Mr. Wright!? Leads to: \"I'm going to present some evidence!\"Phoenix: I'm going to present some evidence!Judge: So what did Mr. Dingling use to commit the crime of murder against Russell Berry?Present Max G. Bust Phoenix: Leads to: \"What's that? A picture?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: ... von Karma: ... Acro: ... Maya: I think you should try again, especially before someone gets the chance to say something. Phoenix: Yeah, you're probably right. Umm... So as I was saying... This piece of evidence-- Judge: Stop! Stop! Wait, I say! Before you start over, you must be penalized! Phoenix: (Doh! He caught me...) Judge: And if you don't put an end to this funny business, I've got a few more ideas! Leads back to: \"I'm going to present some evidence!\"Judge: What's that? A picture?Phoenix: It is indeed. The problem is with the item that's shown in the picture.Judge: The bust?Phoenix: It's quite a large bust. And because it is life sized, it is also very, very heavy.von Karma: Heavy...?Phoenix: Heavy enough to guarantee a certain death. Especially if it was dropped from a third story window.von Karma: AHHH!!Acro: ...Phoenix: See! This is how Acro was able to kill the Ringmaster! With the force of gravity and Maximillion Galactica's ample bust!Judge: Order! Order! So you're saying the bust fell onto the Ringmaster!?Phoenix: A rather simple crime... Even if you were stuck in a wheelchair, it would be incredibly easy to commit...von Karma:von Karma: How could you possibly wheel a wheelchair with something so heavy!? It's impossible!Phoenix:Phoenix: Well, Acro is an acrobat! He should have more than enough upper body strength to carry something like the bust!Judge: Mr. Dingling, how do you respond to these charges!?Acro: Well...Maya: Acro's at a loss for words!Phoenix: (He should be... He knows that I'm getting close to the truth!) Well well well, Acro. You can't run away from things this time... OWWW!!von Karma: I'd watch what I say, if I were you, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix: Wh-What!?von Karma: Your Honor! The physical health of the witness is material to this case! I demand that we get proper testimony from the witness himself!Judge: Hmm... Testimony you say...Phoenix: (Von Karma... She's just using this \"testimony\" as a rouse [sic] to stall for time!)Phoenix:Phoenix: There is absolutely no need for such testimony!von Karma:von Karma: The defense has its version of the murder. The prosecution has the right to respond!Judge: The defense's objection is overruled...Phoenix: (Why can't he see things my way once in a while!)Judge: Mr. Dingling, I'm sorry, but we need you to testify about your physical condition. If you have any doubts about your ability to testify, we can request expert testimony.von Karma: The witness will have no problems; however, let's all be respectful towards him.Acro: Thank you...Phoenix: (Argh! That woman will sink to any low to win a case!)Witness Testimony-- Acro's Physical State --Acro: I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust. I have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured. However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible. There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body. That makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head. Thus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?Judge: Hmm... I have no doubts in regards to this witness's testimony.von Karma: It was impossible for him to lift the bust and stick himself out far enough to look. (Changed from [It was impossible for him to lift the bust and carry it over to the window.] in the original release) Not to mention that he could not have known the location of the Ringmaster's head. A single false step would have lead [sic] to even more severe injuries.Judge: That's what I was thinking. What is your opinion on the matter, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: ... I'd still like to proceed with my cross-examination.von Karma: He's simply stalling. It's shameful, really.Phoenix: (Grr... I can't let her get to me... I've got to focus...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Acro's Physical State --Acro: I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Have you ever lifted up the bust before...? Acro: No, I've never actually lifted it up with my own two hands... But I should get to it, don't you think? I can't let Money outdo me on this. Phoenix: Money...? (That crazy monkey has lifted Max's bust before?) Acro: ... Judge: Hmm... Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Dingling.Acro: I have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So what have you been doing to keep in shape? Acro: Well, honestly, I've given up on training. I don't have any plans to return to the trapeze or the tightrope. Phoenix: You don't say... Acro: But, no offense, I'm not worried about losing to you in a race or anything. von Karma: Neither am I, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Maya: I wouldn't lose either, slow poke! ...I mean Nick! Phoenix: (Whoa whoa whoa! How did the discussion turn to me all of a sudden!?) Acro: I suppose you could say that I'm stronger than the average bear...Acro: However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why is that? Acro: Because if I were to do that, I'd end up falling out the window myself. I still haven't gotten much feeling back in my legs yet. Judge: Hmm... So you couldn't have thrown that bust out of the window...Acro: There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long do you think your recovery will take? Acro: Hmm... You have to remember that the nerves were severed. I'm currently undergoing some extremely intensive rehabilitation, but it's still going to take a while before I'm back to 100%. von Karma: Let me remind you of another very important point. If the witness was carrying the bust, he would not be able to see out below the window.Acro: That makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why do you say it would be impossible? Acro: Allow me to explain. You accept that if I was carrying the bust, I couldn't see out below the window? Thus, there is no way that I would know the location of the Ringmaster's head. Phoenix: Well... I suppose you've got a point. Maya: Hey, Nick? Phoenix: Huh? Maya: What if you turned things around? Maybe if you think of it sorta like this... \"If he knew the location of the Ringmaster's head, then he could drop the bust.\" Phoenix: That does make sense... (If only I could prove somehow... That Acro knew the location of the Ringmaster's head without looking down...) Acro: ... I think I've already explained things sufficiently.Present Crime Photo or Wooden Box Phoenix: Leads to: \"Acro...\"Acro: Thus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: If all you had to do was drop it, then it wouldn't have been a problem at all! Acro: If all I had to do was drop it... You're right. I could've done that; however, there is no way that I could score a direct hit on the Ringmaster's head. Judge: Hmm... So that kind of makes your theory a bit pointless, doesn't it, Mr. Wright?Present Crime Photo or Wooden Box Phoenix: Leads to: \"Acro...\"Phoenix: (Acro is strong enough to lift up the bust...)Maya: The main problem is how he could have aimed for the Ringmaster's head.Phoenix: Hmm... I wonder if he used some kind of tool to aim for the Ringmaster...?Maya: That's the ticket, Nick! Show them what you've got!Phoenix: I have to be careful. I have to find something that fits perfectly with the case.Maya: Hmm... I don't remember us finding any sort of tool...

The testimonies are about Acro's physical state and his ability to commit the murder.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, the third one says, \"There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body.\" Acro is claiming that he couldn't use his lower body strength to lift or position the bust. But the evidence might show that he didn't need lower body strength because he used his upper body. \n\nThe relevant evidence here is Max G. Bust (evidence 14). Acro's upper body strength, from being an acrobat, would allow him to lift the bust without needing his legs. So even though he can't use his lower body, he could still lift the bust using his upper body strength, which contradicts his testimony that it was impossible because of his lower body."

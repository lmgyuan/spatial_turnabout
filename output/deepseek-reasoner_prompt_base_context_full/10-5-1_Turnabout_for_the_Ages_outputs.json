It's emblazoned with the mark of the Yatagarasu and it really stands out. I doubt there are any thieves who would actually wear it. Lotta: So, what are y'all gonna do now? I reckon... yer through bein' a prosecutor, right? Edgeworth: Yes... that's true, I suppose. (I'm no longer a prosecutor. However...) Kay: You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right? Edgeworth: Indeed... de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: (This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...) Lotta: Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off! Kay: That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop? Lotta: What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves... ???: S-Someone! Help! Kay: Yikes! What's that!? ???: S-Someone! P-Please help! Edgeworth: (Hmm. This woman is...) What's happened!? ???: S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...! Edgeworth: (A... monster?) Lotta: I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me! ???: Please follow me! It's this way! Kay: Has something else happened? Again!? Edgeworth: I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now. April 6, 10:05 AMOutside Bigg BuildingTemporary Film Lot Kay: Eh!? These are...!? Lotta: G-Genuine hoofprints! Edgeworth: (Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Look! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang...! Why is he here?) Kay: Ah! Someone's on the ground! Edgeworth: (It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!) Lang: ........ Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Lang: ......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here. Edgeworth: What happened? Lang: What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know! Edgeworth: (It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?) Lotta: It's a m... m... monster! Edgeworth: A... monster? Lotta: Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the Mighty Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Mighty... Moozilla...?) Lotta: This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! \"Man Trampled to Death by Monster!\" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper! Edgeworth: (What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?) Huang: I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis. Edgeworth: The real assassin was you all along...! de Killer: That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life... Edgeworth: (That man... could he have...?) Lang: Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body? ???: Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well. Edgeworth: (! Agent Lang?) Lang: Lang Zi says: \"First come, first suspected.\" You! Did you really just discover the body!? ???: O-O-O-O-O-Of course! Kay: Please calm down! You're scaring her! Edgeworth: (He does seem to have lost his composure...) Lang: Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. This isn't like you. Lang: ! Edgeworth: When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men? Lang: What... did you say...? Edgeworth: Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong? Lang: ........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation. Edgeworth: (Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too! Edgeworth: Yes. Let us investigate. (Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...) Lotta: What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the \"man\" behind it, more like the \"monster\" behind it, ya know? Edgeworth: Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation? Lotta: Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop! ???: Umm... Excuse me. Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...) ???: You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me? Edgeworth: Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before... Kay: Huh? Do you know her? Edgeworth: Yes, I do. (At least I think I do...) Kay: My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! Penny: My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you. Edgeworth: (Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...) It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is... Penny: Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body... Edgeworth: I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police? Penny: Y-Yes! Right away! Edgeworth: (I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things besides the body that concern me. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...) Begin Investigation Outside Bigg BuildingTemporary Film Lot Logic \"Rear entrance forced open\" and \"Combination lock\" Edgeworth: The front entrance, which leads to the Tower Plaza, was locked with a combination lock. At the other hand... the lock on the rear entrance, which leads to the Bigg Building, was broken. Now, where does this lead us? Kay: Heh heh heh! I know this one! The culprit entered from the rear entrance, right!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And knowing this... we now understand one more critical fact. The culprit must be someone who didn't know the number to unlock the combination lock. Kay: Right! If they knew the code, it would've been way easier to enter from the front entrance! Entering through the back door is common sense for a thief. It's much less conspicuous. We can't underestimate a culprit who thinks like a thief! Please keep your guard up! Edgeworth: (She sure becomes lively all of a sudden when this subject gets brought up...) To put it simply, everyone involved with the movie knows the combination for the lock. In other words, it's quite likely that the culprit is someone who is not involved with the film. Combination Lock data jotted down in my Organizer. \"Dented fence\" and \"Broken horn\" Edgeworth: The dent in this fence... and the broken horn... Neither of these things were there yesterday evening. Based on the fact that these two things have changed... Kay: Ah! Could Moozilla's head have...!? Edgeworth: Indeed. The head that was on the rooftop (Monster's head - It may have rolled off the studio roof and tumbled to the ground.) may have tumbled down onto the ground. This is a new possibility. (Which would mean that...) \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Edgeworth: We may have found the missing murder weapon... Kay: Eh! Really!? Edgeworth: At the moment, I can only say that it is just a possibility... If the giant monster head had fallen off from the studio roof... Kay: Ah! That could definitely be a murder weapon! Ms. Nichols, may we investigate the studio roof? Penny: The roof? OK, I understand! Go on ahead! But the stairs can be a little bit slippery, so please watch your step! Partner Kay: Yeah, what's up? Notice anything? Kay: I still can't believe the president has been murdered... Do you think he was really trampled to death by a monster? Edgeworth: Surely you can't be serious? There are no such things as monsters. Kay: Whaaat!? So it wasn't a monster who did this? Then, who do you say killed the president!? Edgeworth: As the president of Zheng Fa, I'm sure there are more than a few people targeting his life. Just like Shelly de Killer tried to do, not too long ago. Kay: So, you think he was killed by someone like Mr. de Killer? Edgeworth: I can't say for certain yet... but neither can I deny that possibility. Kay: But, we can't deny the possibility of him being killed by a monster, either! I mean, just take a look at all these monster's footprints! Plus, a horn-like object was lying on the ground next to the president. Edgeworth: (A horn-like object...? I can't say for certain that it's not related to this case. Perhaps I should take a moment and compare it with the evidence I have on hand.) Agent Lang Kay: I never would have thought we'd run into Mr. Lang in a place like this! But, he didn't seem to be in a very good mood though. Edgeworth: It's understandable. Agent Lang is from the Republic of Zheng Fa. With President's Huang's death, he must have a lot on his mind. Kay: Come to think of it, he doesn't have his men-in-black in tow with him today either. I always picture him with an army of subordinates following him around... Edgeworth: (Agent Lang... I wonder if something has happened to him?) Moozilla (after examining broken lock and talking about \"Broken horn\" with Penny) Edgeworth: Did you already know about this \"Moozilla\" monster? Kay: Nope. I just learned about it today! I mean, the movie came out 12 years ago, right? Back then, I was just a cute little girl! But, the \"Mighty Moozilla\" sure does sound pretty sweet! Edgeworth: Heh... It certainly does seem like the kind of movie you would enjoy. Kay: Well, duh, it's a giant monster! What's not to like about giant monsters!? Edgeworth: I for one can't understand the appeal of these so-called \"giant monsters\". Kay: Well, I don't get what's so great about the Steel Samurai! Edgeworth: Ugh...! Kay! I'll have you know, the Steel Samurai is... Kay: Yeah, yeah. More importantly, shouldn't we get back to our investigation now? Why don't we take a minute to reorganize any information we haven't yet put together? We might be able to make a new connection! Edgeworth: Yes... Indeed. Present Yatagarasu's Badge Kay: Eureka! Seeing this badge... just gave me a great idea! As a token of appreciation for everything you've done for me, Mr. Edgeworth... ...I'm gonna carve an awesome badge for you out of an eraser. Should I carve your face from the side? Or from the front? Hmm, maybe a diagonal view... Edgeworth: (Why are you so set on the theme being my face...?) Kay: Ah! But if it's something new you want, how about a view from directly below? Edgeworth: (This badge has quickly gone from \"awesome\" to \"awful\"...) Letter from Unknown or Bigg Building Kay: When my memory was gone, I... ...I felt like I was walking through a freezing rain the entire time. But, when it all came back... Edgeworth: ...Did something happen when you regained your memory? Kay: Nope... It's nothing. Thank you so very much! Edgeworth: ...Kay. I am not the one who recovered your memories. The person you should thank is the one who had you write in that notebook. Kay: Daddy! Mr. Edgeworth! Thank you both so much! ...Eheheh. I feel a lot better now! Edgeworth: If you're going to shout, please give a little more consideration to the time and place... Crime Scene Notes Kay: Mr. President... We only just exposed the fake assassination, I can't believe he was really assassinated... Edgeworth: Indeed. It's quite tragic, but no matter how you look at it, this time he's truly gone. Our final parting gift to him will be uncovering the truth behind this case. Kay: That's right. This'll be... a paycheck for the president! Edgeworth: I think you mean \"payback\", Kay. Monster Movie Flyer, Moozilla's Head, or Moozilla Doll Kay: The Mighty Moozilla vs Gourdy! What an earth-shattering battle that would be! Gourdy tries to devour Moozilla! But, the horns get caught, so it can't swallow Moozilla whole! Moozilla tries biting back! But, Gourdy's skin is really slick, so Moozilla can't chomp down. Oh, this kind of buildup always gets my heart pounding! Edgeworth: (I'll never understand why today's youth get so invested in these things...) Anything else Kay: I believe that even a Great Thief has rights. For example, we have the right to choose what we want to steal. Edgeworth: (I guess she doesn't consider this valuable.) Monster costume Edgeworth: There is a monster costume in front of this building. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is that really a costume? Maybe it's actually the monster who made all these footprints, and it just shrunk itself down! Edgeworth: ......I'll say this one more time, so listen carefully. There is a monster costume in front of this building. It's just a costume! Lighting equipment Edgeworth: This seems to be the lighting equipment they're using for the film. Kay: ...Ah, that's right! There's something I wanted to ask you, Mr. Edgeworth! When I'm stealing something, can you use this to make me look cool in a spotlight? Edgeworth: You want someone to shine a light on you when you're stealing something? Kay: Well, duh! If the Yatagarasu's handiwork can't be seen because it's too dark... ...wouldn't you feel bad for the people watching? Edgeworth: (You're planning to steal things with an audience looking on...?) Penny Nichols Penny: I'm sorry about earlier... I was... a little flustered. Discovery of the body Edgeworth: Were you here alone? Penny: Yes. I arrived before everyone else today in order to get things prepared. When I entered the lot, I immediately noticed... those giant hoofprints. Kay: The monster's footprints, right!? Weren't you surprised? Penny: Yes. Because they hadn't been there yesterday evening. Edgeworth: (So that means the footprints were made last night...) Penny: Well, when I first saw them, I thought they were a part of the set. But, when I got closer to the studio, I saw that a person had collapsed. Edgeworth: You didn't notice until you got closer...? Penny: Lately, it seems my eyesight has gotten worse again, and my glasses aren't strong enough. As I approached the body, I finally realized what it was. I was so scared, I ran away. Edgeworth: (And that was when she ran into us...) Filming a movie Edgeworth: You said they were... filming a movie? Could it be... the Steel Samurai...? Penny: No. Edgeworth: (So it wasn't...) Penny: We're making a monster movie this time around. Have you ever hears of the \"Mighty Moozilla\" series? Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but no... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth isn't interested in anything other than the Steel Samurai after all! Edgeworth: Th-That's not... Penny: I guess that's to be expected, as the promotion for the film hasn't really started yet. \"The Mighty Moozilla! Its revival breaks its 12 years of silence!\" It's the long awaited sequel to the original series, so the staff are all fired up! The film is set at the Bigg Building, so we're filming on location around this area. Edgeworth: (Come to think of it, yesterday...) Gumshoe: What's wrong, pal!? Did something happen at the Bigg Building!? Cuuuuuut! Cut, cut, cut, cuuuut! ???: E-Excuse me! We're sort of in the middle of shooting a movie, and umm... Edgeworth: (I saw them filming something then. It must have been this...) Kay: I bet it ends with Moozilla completely destroying the Bigg Building! Penny: Tee-hee. I wonder? You'll have to look forward to finding out in the theaters. If you like, you can have this. Edgeworth: Hmm. Let's see... The Battle of the Century! Now... it meets its greatest rival! \"Mighty Moozilla vs Gourdy\" Edgeworth: (Wait... Gourdy?) Penny: This time, it won't just be Moozilla, a rival monster appears as well! Have you heard of it? Gourdy of Gourd Lake. Kay: Ah! Wasn't it the talk of the town two or three years ago? It's a mysterious monster living in Gourd Lake! By chance, someone took a photo of it! Edgeworth: (It wasn't just the talk of the town, it was also involved in a case from my past. Gourdy... huh. Now there's a name I don't really want to remember.) Penny: When the director caught wind of that rumor, he decided to add it into the story. Edgeworth: (I get the feeling he was a bit late to catch on...) Penny: Please look forward to seeing the showdown between these two rival monsters! Monster Movie Flyer data jotted down in my Organizer. After examining horn Edgeworth: (Is there anything out of place with what I've investigated so far?) The entrance Edgeworth: (I should confirm what the security situation was like at the scene of the crime.) Ms. Nichols. Was the entrance to this place locked? Penny: Yes. It's locked with this. Kay: It's one of those types where you have to put in the correct numbers to open it, right? Edgeworth: About this combination lock, was it also properly locked today? Penny: Yes. When I arrived here today, it was locked tight. Edgeworth: Who knows the combination? Penny: The producer, the director, the staff, and the actors... I think everyone involved in the movie knew about it. Edgeworth: (So anyone involved with the film could have opened the combination lock (Combination lock - Used on front entrance. Only the cast and crew knew the combination.) and gone in.) Broken horn Edgeworth: About this horn... Have you ever seen it before? Penny: Huh? That's Moozilla's horn. It's a model we made to use in our ad campaign. ...Where was it? Edgeworth: It was on the ground by the back entrance. Penny: That's strange... Moozilla's head should have been stored on the studio roof. Edgeworth: I suppose the head would have to be rather large, wouldn't it? Penny: Yes! It's not as big as the real thing, of course, but it's still quite large! Look. You can see it from here. See? It's right there. Edgeworth: It certainly is large... (Broken horn - Was lying next to the body. Had been stored on the roof last night.) Present Monster's Footprints Penny: ...If I remember correctly, the Moozilla in our film also has split hooves. Edgeworth: Surely, you're not suggesting that the president was trampled to death by a monster? Penny: Oh, no! Rather, speaking as a member of the studio staff... ...I don't believe Moozilla would commit a murder. Giant monsters only bother the people in the movies. That's the cardinal rule for those involved in monster movies. Edgeworth: (Indeed. It would be problematic if it weren't that way.) Monster Movie Flyer or Moozilla's Head Penny: Moozilla is a symbol of nature. That's why it destroys cities. Edgeworth: (That's a rather sketchy explanation...) Penny: It uses its horns to attack, but that's not its only technique. It has a Sonic Moo sound wave attack, a sticky drool spray, dual milk shooters... ...a BBQ smokescreen diversion, and a leather shows & bags production line ultra combo. Kay: The more you describe it... the less powerful it sounds. Penny: Well, making it look powerful is a job for us filmmakers, after all! Edgeworth: (...Won't the producers of the movie get mad at them?) Anything else Penny: Ahh! Th-That's! Edgeworth: Hmm? Do you know something about this? Penny: Huh...? I-I'm sorry! I think I was just mistaken. Lately, the prescription of my glasses hasn't been quite right. I deeply apologize for my shameful behavior! Edgeworth: (That's not something you need to apologize for...) (Clearing \"Discovery of the body\", \"Filming a movie\", \"The entrance\" and \"Broken horn\" \"Talk\" option before examining film crane and vinyl sheets leads to:) Kay: There sure are a lot of interesting things around here! Penny: Tee-hee. It's the equipment we use for filming. The Moozilla costume and the camera crane. Kay: They really are treasures! I'm getting kinda excited! Edgeworth: (It's possible that some of this equipment was used in the crime... I'd better take a closer look.) Shi-Long Lang Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. So we meet again. Edgeworth: Indeed. Just a few days ago, we met at the detention center... Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What brings you here? Lang: Just some boring work. Nothing you need to know about. Lang: Tch. You always pick the worst time to show up. Anyone ever tell you that bad things happen when you're around? Just don't get in the way of my investigation, OK? I must avenge the death of our president... Why were you here? Edgeworth: You arrived here before us... What were you doing in a place like this? Lang: .....You suspect me? Edgeworth: Heh... Come now. Lang: I heard a scream. It was the woman who found the body... After hearing the scream, I came in through that entrance over there. Apparently, it wasn't locked. Edgeworth: (Then why is there a lock on the ground over there...? I should take a closer look.) Lang: When I got in... ...woman who found the body was already running out the other exit over there. Edgeworth: (So he came here around the same time we did...) Why were you at the Bigg Building? Lang: Well... I had my reasons... Edgeworth: (...He also said something along those lines when we met at the detention center.) Kay: Maybe he's really a fan of giant monsters, and he came to sneak a peek at the Moozilla set? Lang: ...Giant monsters? I've no interest in such things. Edgeworth: (He clearly doesn't think the murderer is a monster either.) President Huang Edgeworth: It's regrettable what happened to the president... Lang: ...Yeah. Huang was the pride of Zheng Fa. And yet... Edgeworth: It seems like you were quite close to the president. Lang: The previous head of the Lang clan, my father, served under President Huang. Protecting the life of the president has long been our clan's greatest duty. My old man received a great number of special medals from the president himself... As a token of his trust, the president left his will in the protection of the Lang clan. Those medals and that will, they were the pride of our clan. Our family treasures, so to speak. Tch. Who would've thought the day to unseal that will... would arrive so soon! Kay: So then. I guess the president was like a close family friend... ...Huh? But during the incident at Gourd Lake... ...why weren't you with the president, Mr. Lang? Lang: ......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: (12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?) Lang: Even so, I still respect the man. Zheng Fa is a small country. But he carried the nation with his strength. Damn it! Just what were his bodyguards doing!? Edgeworth: Have you already contacted the embassy? Lang: Yeah, of course. I've also informed Zheng Fa and my clan as well. It's gotten pretty hectic there, what with the will and all... ...but it'll be the same here. Once the bodyguards show up. If you don't wanna see me rip into them, I suggest you get out of here soon. Present Yatagarasu's Badge Lang: That's what the little crow-girl's always wearing on her clothes, isn't it? Kay: It represents the most powerful animal in nature, my Yatagarasu Badge. Isn't it awesome!? Lang: Most powerful animal in nature...? Not so fast. I can't let that one slide. Lang Zi says: \"The wolf is mightier than the crow.\" Just one slash from a wolf's claw and your little crow would be nevermore. Kay: Take that back, Wolfy! Thief Girl says: \"The crow soars above all others.\" I'll swoop in to peck the wolf to pieces and then fly back up to avoid the wolf's claws! Lang: Don't underestimate a wolf's jumping ability! It'll bite the crow before it can fly away! Kay: A crow can flap its wings so hard, it'll blow the big bad wolf away! Lang: Grrrrr... Kay: Kaw kaw-kaw-kaw... Edgeworth: (They're squabbling like children.) Monster's Footprints or Monster Movie Flyer Lang: Tch. Moozilla? What're you asking me about that for? Edgeworth: I won't say the culprit is a monster, but it seems a little too early to say it's unrelated. If you know anything, then by all means, please tell me. Lang: Hmph. The president always had a Moozilla doll with him. I've caught a glimpse of it on occasion. That's how I knew. Edgeworth: (A Moozilla doll, huh... Indeed, there was one inside the president's plane.) Kay: So even a foreign president was a fan. Moozilla sure has international appeal. You know how different countries have different sounds for animal noises? So, I wonder what kind of sounds a foreign Moozilla would make? Edgeworth: (I don't even know what kind of sound a domestic Moozilla would make...) Crime Scene Notes Lang: Damn it! You don't have to show me that! Whoever killed the president... ...you can be damned well sure I'm gonan catch 'em! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang... Whenever President Huang is brought up, he seems to lose his composure.) Kay: I kinda feel bad for Mr. Lang... Isn't there anything we can do for him? Edgeworth: Yes. And it is for that reason we must listen carefully to what he has to say. Anything else Lang: You keep shoving irrelevant nonsense under my nose... ...and I'll chew it to pieces! Edgeworth: (Hmm... I think I should put this away for now.) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options leads to:) Lang: ...Mr. Prosecutor. Right now, I'm just a single Interpol agent. A literal lone wolf. They probably won't let me be in charge of the investigation. But you better believe... my fangs are as sharp as ever...! I'd definitely capture the culprit with my own hands. And you'd better not get in my way. Body Kay: Wow... It really is the president. Edgeworth: Yes. (To think we saw him alive just a few days ago...) Kay: That would make this a presidential assassination, right? Edgeworth: This is a bit flashy for an assassination... Before deducing and examining ground and body Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) After deducing and examining ground and body Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Ground around the body Kay: There are broken pieces of concrete scattered all around the president. Edgeworth: Yes. They were probably scattered about when the ground got damaged. Kay: And that must have been when the monster's foot went \"Thud!\" Edgeworth: If the culprit... was actually a monster. Monster's Footprints data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Hmm... It kinda looks like a hoof, the way it's split in two like that! Yup, it definitely looks like a monster's footprint to me! And there's even three of them (Three footprints - There are three footprints at the scene. They are shaped like hooves.), Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: There are no such things as monsters. Do you honestly believe they exist? Kay: No, not really... but wouldn't it be cool if they did exist!? Edgeworth: ...We're searching for the truth, Kay. Not for what is cool. Body Edgeworth: There are no visible external wounds... but it's clear that he's already passed away. Kay: So then, I guess he really did get stepped on by a... a... Edgeworth: A monster (Stepped on by a monster? - The president was found dead in the middle of what looks like a footprint.)...? Hmph. That's impossible. Kay: Huh? Don't the president's clothes look a bit dirty to you? Edgeworth: Indeed, there appears to be some sort of yellow stain... Kay: I bet it's monster drool! Edgeworth: Kay, please be more serious. We'll need to have forensics take a closer look at this stain. (So, this was the state of the body... I should make a note of it.) Crime Scene Notes jotted down in my Organizer. Horn Kay: What's this white thing...? W-Wait! Is this a bone!? Looks like we've got a new case on our hands! Edgeworth: It looks less like a bone... and more like some kind of horn. Deduce (after talking about \"Filming a movie\") Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Deduce horn and present Monster Movie Flyer Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Doesn't this horn belong to that monster, Moozilla?\" Otherwise Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's a connection between this spot and the evidence... I think! Kay: Huh! What's the connection!? Edgeworth: Hmph... That's what I'm going to figure out right now. Kay: What!? You haven't figured it out yet!? Edgeworth: Nngh! (I guess that was wrong. Wasn't there something that fell near the victim that was bothering me? I should look into that before going any further.) Edgeworth: Doesn't this horn belong to that monster, Moozilla? Kay: You're right! It looks just like it! Maybe it's a prop for the film? Edgeworth: Based on the size of the horn... the head should be quite large. Kay: I wonder how it ended up here. Edgeworth: I'm sure we'll find out if we ask someone on the staff. Lotta Hart Lotta: Whaddaya want!? I'm a busy gal! Ya best not get in my way! Edgeworth: Why are you so obsessed with that monster? Such a thing couldn't possibly exist... Lotta: What'd ya say...!? I ain't lettin' that pass! Moozilla lives! I'm sure of it! It's the mightiest monster on this side of the Pacific Rim. Edgeworth: I don't suppose you have some kind of basis for that? Lotta: I..... saw it with my own two eyes. Kay: What!? You saw it...? No way... Lotta: Yes way! The Mighty Moozilla was really here! Last night, when I was on the 51st floor of the Bigg Building. Edgeworth: You mean when you were snooping around the black market auction... Lotta: That's right! It was right around when I took this here photo! Kay: That's the photo of the person in the red hood! This was Jill Crane, right? Lotta: Ya see those blinds next to the red hood... Well, the Mighty Moozilla was on the other side! Kay: .......Err. But there's nothing in the photo... Lotta: It's mighty hard to capture somethin' like that from such a distance! But I seen it plain as day! Moozilla's giant eye eas peerin' in through those blinds! Edgeworth: (The monster was peering in?) Lotta: Lookie here! Now ain't the time for this! I gotta gather my materials! Ya'll are in my way! Now go on, git! Shoo! Shoo! Edgeworth: (How absurd...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you must be completely dumbfounded right now, aren't you? Edgeworth: (Hmph. Was it that clearly written on my face?) Film crane Kay: ...I wonder what this iron pole is for? Oh, maybe it's used to practice tree climbing? Edgeworth: No, this is a film crane. It's used to capture footage from high locations. Right now it's not attached, but normally there would be a camera connected to the end. Kay: I get it! This would be perfect for scoping out the places you're trying to steal from...! Do you think they would let me borrow this? Edgeworth: And how exactly, may I ask, do you intend to bring it back home with you? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you can take the base, and I'll take the top part... Edgeworth: (...Does she actually expect me to help her?) Kay: If we take it nice and slow... we might be able to make it to your house, Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: (...Not only do you want me to help you carry it, but you plan to leave it at my house!?) Vinyl sheets Kay: Ah! It's one of those sheets you lay out on the floor when you're having a picnic! Edgeworth: It's definitely a vinyl sheet, however... (I don't think it's for picnics.) Penny: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth. I-If I may... That's actually a waterproof sheet. It's used with the camera crane over there. We'll cover the camera crane with it when it's raining. Kay: Then, this sheet... must be pretty big. Penny: Yes. It would be pointless if we didn't cover up the entire crane. The weather was overcast yesterday, so we've been using it quite a bit. Broken lock Edgeworth: Ms. Nichols, where does this entrance lead to...? Penny: It's connected to the Bigg Building lot. Edgeworth: (Does this case also have something to do with that building? The building with a secret 51st floor, where the black market auctions were being held. It wouldn't be strange if it were still hiding a few more secrets...) Bigg Building data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: (Hm? This lock and chain...?) Kay: Ah! Someone cut through the chain! Penny: What? I'm sure it was locked up properly yesterday though. Edgeworth: Then, it's possible the culprit forced his way in through here... (Rear entrance forced open - The chain on the rear entrance was cut. Did the culprit do it?) Penny: Ahh! Edgeworth: (Wh-What is it...?) Penny: It's completely dented in... How did this happen!? Edgeworth: ...Hmm. There is indeed a huge dent in the fence over there. Something rather heavy must have struck it, in order to make a dent like that. Penny: It wasn't like that at all yesterday... Edgeworth: (It wasn't...? So this dent (Dented fence - Yesterday it was still fine. Did it get struck by something heavy?) was made last night...) Broken lock (subsequent times) Edgeworth: This leads to the Bigg Building. Kay: But from where I'm standing, all I can see are just your everyday run-of-the-mill buildings. I don't see anyone special around here either. Edgeworth: Indeed. At least from where we're standing, that is. ...Now then, we have no time to waste. We should get back to investigating the film lot. (Connecting \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Logic leads to:) Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check... Edgeworth: (Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?) Hm? ???: ........ ........ Lang: ........ ???: .....Move it. Lang: What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners. ???: ...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already. Lang: ! Penny: I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, John! Lang: Tch! Penny: Oh! What were you doing!? ???: .......Who was that? Penny: Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him? ???: Hmph. Kay: That sure was a tense standoff! Edgeworth: (He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...) Penny: Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is John Marsh. He's the lead actor in our movie. Edgeworth: (The lead actor... is this child?) Kay: Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you! Edgeworth: And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. John: .......Prosecutor? Penny: He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know. John: But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge. Edgeworth: Gah! (He's frightfully perceptive...) Penny: Ah! John, it's probably better if you didn't go over there... John: ............ Edgeworth: (That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.) Upstairs Edgeworth: May we see the roof? Penny: Yes, of course! Go right ahead! Edgeworth: (So, this is... Moozilla?) Kay: Huh? Somehow this doesn't feel quite right... See, this looks way cooler. ...And he doesn't have a nose ring either. Penny: Ah, I see. You two aren't familiar with Moozilla. This is Moozilla's original design from 12 years ago! Kay: Whaaat!? Th-Then, what's this? Penny: That's our take on it for the new movie. We revamped the design to appeal to modern audiences! Kay: \"Revamped\"...? But it looks totally different! And, no matter how you look at this one... Edgeworth: ...it's a cow... Penny: Well, of course. After all, Moozilla was originally a cow monster. Kay: A c-cow monster...? Penny: Having a cow, an animal that humans are very familiar with, turn into a monster... ...allows us to question mankind's relationship with nature! That's the theme of Moozilla. Kay: ......Meh. I just don't get it. Edgeworth: Nor do I... Before examining model and table Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) After examining model and table Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Heater Kay: There's a heater here. Do you think the staff uses it to keep themselves warm? Edgeworth: It's possible. Although it may be spring, it can still get rather chilly at night. Kay: M-Mr. Edgeworth! People are gonna think you're an old geezer if you say stuff like that! Even in the best of times, you tend to see things like an old man... Can't you at least TRY to be more cheerful and lively when you talk? Edgeworth: (Do I really seem that unlively...?) Paint thinner Edgeworth: There is a can of paint thinner here. It's probably used for making props. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, doesn't the area around here look kinda burnt? Edgeworth: It does. This spread-out blue sheet, newspaper, and the side of this can all look burnt. Kay: Hmm. I wonder if this Moozilla's head can also shoot out flames? Well, this old Moozilla design doesn't really look like it could breathe fire anyways. Edgeworth: (That's not our main concern... but I'm certainly curious.) Model Penny: We made this replica of the original Moozilla's head for promotional purposes. We'll be using it to let people know that the film is a sequel to the original series. Kay: I guess it would be hard for people to tell that they're the same monster. Edgeworth: As we suspected, one of the horns appears to be broken... Kay: So, did this head really crush the president? Edgeworth: It's possible, however... there's something I don't quite understand. Kay: What's that? Edgeworth: Ms. Nichols. This head looks rather heavy... How do you transport it? Penny: Ah, it's made so that it can be taken apart. It's not that hard, if you know how to do it. But, if you don't know how, it'd be pretty much impossible, I think. Edgeworth: (Which means it would be difficult for anyone not involved in the film...) When taken apart, would it be possible for one person to carry it alone? Penny: Definitely. Given enough time, even I could do it! Moozilla's Head data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: (However, this face is...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. Umm... I feel like I've seen this cow somewhere before... Edgeworth: Indeed. I was just thinking the exact same thing. (It was on board the president's plane... ...and in the storeroom of the black market auction...) The president's stuffed toy... Kay: So, that was a doll of the original Moozilla... Edgeworth: (Could this really be just a coincidence?) Moozilla Doll data jotted down in my Organizer. Model (subsequent times) Kay: Since he had a Moozilla doll with him, maybe the president was a big fan. And, his love for Moozilla was so great that he tried picking up the head and got crushed. Edgeworth: I doubt a normal person would have the strength to lift this up. Since he wasn't involved with the movie, he wouldn't have known how to take it apart. Kay: Hmm. If Moozilla really existed, that would explain everything though... Can't you just connect the pieces in that direction for once...? With logic, I mean. Edgeworth: Please don't give me that look. Table Edgeworth: Some sort of wooden stand has fallen over. The area around it seems to be burnt black. Penny: Huh? Moozilla's head should have been on that stand... Kay: But, the legs have broken off... It doesn't look like it can be used anymore. Edgeworth: Hmm. The broken legs seem to be badly burnt. I think it's safe to assume that a small fire occurred here. Kay: A small fire, huh? Is that what burnt and broke the legs of the stand? Edgeworth: When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand... Kay: ...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire! Edgeworth: Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness. Penny: Oooh... I'm sorry. I'll make sure this doesn't happen again...! But, I don't think anyone used the heater yesterday... Edgeworth: (I see. In that case... I wonder what caused the fire?) Light stand Kay: I could probably carry a light stand of this size on my shoulder. Edgeworth: Kay. Don't tell me you're planning to steal this. Kay: Of course not! But if I carried this around with me... ...I could shine a spotlight on you whenever you shout \"Objection\"! Man, that sounds so cool! ...So, when should we start? Edgeworth: Never, please. Penny Nichols Present Moozilla Doll Penny: Ah, that's a first-generation Moozilla plushie! ...So you knew about it? Edgeworth: No. I only happened to see the doll. I didn't know anything about the films. Kay: I think this is much cuter than the head on the roof. It's a little dirty though. Penny: That can't be helped. Those were sold quite a long time ago, after all. Back then, it was aimed at children, and it seems to have had moderate success. I heard a lot of them were sold as presents. Kay: If someone gave me one as a present, I'd want the new and improved version of Moozilla. If someone were to give me a present, that is! Edgeworth: (Why is she looking at me when she says that...?) Commemorative Photo Penny: Ah. It's the photo that John brought. Kay: Who took this photo? Penny: The camera has a self-timer. We took it with just the three of us. Edgeworth: So, about the third person... Just who is in that Moozilla costume in the background? Penny: That's... actually, rather than me telling you, it'd be better if you found out for yourself. I think they'll be outside the studio lot, so if you get a chance later, please go there. Edgeworth: Hmm. Later... huh. Understood. We'll do that. John Marsh John: ............ Edgeworth: John was it? Would you mind if I asked you a few questions? John: ...Hey old man, you really a prosecutor? Edgeworth: Yes. (Hmph. Old man...?) John: Then, first show me your prosecutor's badge. Edgeworth: I don't have my badge with me right now... John: Then, you can't prove you're a prosecutor, old man. Edgeworth: Ngh! Kay: Hmm. This kind is a tough nut to crack, isn't he? Want me to give it a try? Edgeworth: Yes. I'm counting on you Kay. (I'm not good with kids...) John Marsh Kay: So John, you're an actor? John: .....Yeah. What about it? Kay: You're amazing! That's so cool! John: .....N-Not really. Edgeworth: (Hmph. Good grief. At least that seems to have worked.) Kay: Umm, about those horns... John: ...Wh-What about them? Penny: John's horns are specially made prosthetics. John plays a young boy who has a special connection with Moozilla. He can communicate with Moozilla using those horns. Right, John? John: Shut up. Stop blabbering about that stupid stuff! Penny: Ooh... S-Sorry. Edgeworth: (I think I'm beginning to see the kind of relationship these two have...) Kay: But it must be amazing! To star in a movie! And you're only in elementary school! John: Penny: Ah! D-Despite how he looks, John is 13 years old and he's already in middle school... Kay: Whaaat! But... he's so small. And he's wearing a kiddy backpack! Penny: The backpack is a part of his costume. He's an actor, after all. Kay: I-I see. But... he's still really tiny. Penny: I-It's probably better if you didn't talk about his height in front of... John: I thought I told you to stop blabbering about stupid stuff! Penny: S-Sorry! Edgeworth: (It seems the only thing that's not a prop is that milk carton.) The president (appears after John Marsh) John: That guy over there... He's the president, right? Kay: Yup. Do you know him? John: .....Yeah. I've met him before. Edgeworth: (This boy... has met with the president?) John: .....Hmph. That guy makes me sick. Kay: Th-That's not a very nice thing to say. Why do you hate the president so much? John: ........ Kay: Huh... And now he's giving me the silent treatment... Penny: U-Um! The truth is, the president was involved in the film. Edgeworth: The president was involved in the film? What do you mean? Penny: He was supposed to have a brief cameo in the movie. He came by to look around the set some time ago. That was when he met with John. Edgeworth: Why would the president be appearing in this film? Penny: We heard he was a fan of the original Moozilla series... And so we made him an offer. We thought it would make great publicity, you see. John: ...He comes on the movie set like he's on some sightseeing tour. It's so annoying. Penny: John, you really shouldn't say stuff like that. It's not nice. John: ...Shut it. Edgeworth: (I guess he couldn't tolerate having an amateur appear in his film...) Present Monster Movie Flyer, Moozilla's Head, Moozilla Doll, or Commemorative Photo John: Moozilla only exists in the movies... For it to become an actual incident... The thought never even crossed my mind. Edgeworth: John. I'd like you to cooperate with the investigation. John: Hmph. In that case, maybe you should make me care enough to cooperate, old man. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's not very approachable.) Kay: John! If you cooperate with us, I'll give you some delicious candy! John: You think that'll work on me? Don't treat me like a kid! Kay: Aww. Even my candy crush attack didn't work. What a bummer. Edgeworth: (...Candy crush attack?) Anything else John: What's that supposed to be? Giving me that isn't gonna land you a role in the film. Edgeworth: (I wasn't showing it to you so that I could be in the movie...) Kay: Hmm... So then, what do we have to do appear in the movie? Edgeworth: ...Kay, let's just leave it at that, shall we? (Clearing all \"Talk\" option leads to:) Penny: ...... John: ......Oh, right. Here. Penny: What's this? Ah, was this from yesterday? Edgeworth: (A photo...?) John: ...Yeah. Since it was developed, I brought it along with me. You can have it. Penny: I think it turned out quite nicely! So you brought it all the way here for me? Thank you so much. John: ...No, not really. I just happened to have it with me. Edgeworth: Excuse me, but... May I take a quick look at it? Penny: Oh, sure. Here you go! Edgeworth: (So this was taken yesterday... Neither the hoofprints nor the body are in it.) Commemorative Photo data jotted down in my Organizer. (Connecting all possible Logic, examining ground around the body, original Moozilla model and table, clearing all \"Talk\" options of Penny and John, and talking with Lotta leads to:) Investigation Complete Edgeworth: And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished. Kay: So the murder weapon really is... Edgeworth: Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high. Kay: So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh... Edgeworth: Hm? Lang: Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived. Bodyguard: Mr. President! Lang: They really were... far too late. Bodyguard: Damn it! Who did this!? Lang: ...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect. Edgeworth: What? What do you mean? Lang: Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation... Edgeworth: ...So they've already established a plan for this investigation? Lang: I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Bigg Building rooftop. Edgeworth: Th... This is! Lang: This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen! Kay: Wh-Why is Ms. Gravelle there!? Edgeworth: (So he's saying Judge Gravelle is the murder?) Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste! Edgeworth: (Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?) Security Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Lang: Lang: ............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Bigg Building. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a \"prosecutor\". Edgeworth: ! Lang: Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you? Edgeworth: (Hmph...!) Kay: Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!? Lang: .......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a \"prosecutor\"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case? Edgeworth: ........ (Why do I still continue to investigate...?) Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent? Lang: .......... Edgeworth: Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Bigg Building yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as \"prosecutor\" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed. Lang: ........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot. Edgeworth: (Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...) Lang: That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits! Edgeworth: You have my thanks... Lang: However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way! Edgeworth: Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way! Lang: Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into! -- Why Gravelle? -- Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Bigg Building. Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards? Lang: Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about. Edgeworth: (President Huang and Judge Gravelle... Did those two have some sort of connection?) Lang: Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Bigg Building. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president. Kay: Does that mean... the last person to see the president was... Lang: Exactly... Gravelle, you mean? It's gotta be her! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How can you be so sure that the two actually met? Lang: Hmph. Attacking right off the bat... Your fighter's instinct, it's not bad. Trying to keep me in check from the opening move. Impressive. Edgeworth: (No, that wasn't exactly my intention...) Lang: Still, Mr. Prosecutor, I've only just begun. So why don't you pipe down and listen up? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Two nights ago...? Are you certain? Lang: Hmph! If you doubt me, then take a look for yourself! This picture was taken by the security camera on the roof of the Bigg Building... This was undoubtedly taken the night before last! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: All this picture shows is that they went to the rooftop together. There's no indication of what transpired afterwards. Lang: The security cameras were only installed in front of the elevator. There's nothing to show what happened on the viewing platform, but... ...I'm certain of it! That was when the crime took place! Edgeworth: (Hmm. If the president really was murdered two nights ago... ...it would mean that the body has been here ever since.) Lang: What's wrong, Mr. Prosecutor? Something on your mind? But, it's not over yet. I'm just getting started. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Someone could have been hiding on the viewing platform! Kay: That's right! There was even a cotton candy stall up there! Lang: Lang: The owner of the building had been secretly contacted by the president. He could ill-afford any slip ups, so the owner frantically made sure secrecy was maintained. Everyone and everything was cleared out, including the sugar for the cotton candy! Kay: E... Even the sugar...? That's just too cruel! Lang: However, it was all for naught. The president still met his end... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you really think there is no room for doubt? Lang: Heh! Of course I do! The time, the place... Everything points to that woman committing the crime! Edgeworth: I see. The time and the place, everything... huh? (The time following the president's death and where his body was found... It seems I have reached the heart of the matter.) Edgeworth: (Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: A self-styled Great Thief and so-called \"second Yatagarasu\" who's always looking to bag the greatest treasure of all -- the truth.\nCharacter 1\nName: Lotta Hart\nDescription: A freelance photojournalist who I've met in the past.

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony from Lang contradict each other. The testimonies given by Lang are:\n\n1. Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Bigg Building.\n2. Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot.\n3. At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two.\n4. There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!\n\nThe key here is to look at the evidence provided and see which one directly contradicts one of these statements. Let's check the evidence list.\n\nEvidence 10 is the Security Camera Footage, which shows President Wang and Judge Gav\u00e8lle arriving on the roof but no footage of the president leaving. However, Lang's testimony says that Gravelle pushed him off the roof two nights ago. But wait, there's another piece of evidence: Evidence 11 is Ms. Hart's Statement, which states she was in the 51st-floor storeroom the night before last and didn't see the president pass through. However, that might not directly contradict the testimonies. \n\nLooking back, Evidence 9 is the Behind-the-Scenes Photo taken yesterday, showing no monster footprints or body. If the president was killed two nights ago (as per testimony 1 and 2), then the body should have been there yesterday, but the photo from yesterday shows no body. That directly contradicts the timeline Lang is asserting. Because if the body was there two nights ago, it would have been visible in the photo taken yesterday. So Evidence 9 (Behind-the-Scenes Photo) contradicts Testimony 2, which states the murder happened two nights ago. However, the testimony in question is Testimony 3: \"There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!\" Wait, maybe another angle.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 10 (Security Camera Footage) shows the president and Gravelle arriving, but no footage of him leaving. However, Lang's claim is that he was pushed off the roof two nights ago. If the security camera only shows arrival but no departure, it supports that he didn't leave via the elevator, but doesn't directly contradict. However, the contradiction might come from the timeline of when the body was found. The Behind-the-Scenes Photo (Evidence 9) was taken yesterday, and there's no body, so the murder couldn't have happened two nights ago because the body would have been there yesterday. Therefore, Testimony 2 (murder two nights ago) is contradicted by Evidence 9 (photo taken yesterday without the body). But the user's answer expects a pair of evidence and testimony. Let me check the exact testimony numbers. \n\nWait, the user provided four testimonies. The fourth testimony (Testimony 3) is \"There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!\" But the contradiction is more about the timing. If the photo from yesterday (Evidence 9) shows no body, but the murder supposedly happened two nights ago, then the body would have been there yesterday. Therefore, Evidence 9 contradicts Testimony 1 (murder two nights ago). However, the testimonies are numbered from 0 to 3. So Testimony 0: \"met with the president on the rooftop\", Testimony 1: \"pushed him two nights ago\", Testimony 2: \"no one else on the roof\", Testimony 3: \"no doubt she's the murderer\". \n\nThe key contradiction is that the photo (Evidence 9) taken yesterday shows no body, meaning the murder must have happened after that photo was taken. But Lang claims the murder was two nights ago (Testimony 1). Therefore, Evidence 9 (Behind-the-Scenes Photo) contradicts Testimony 1. However, the user's answer structure wants one evidence and one testimony. Alternatively, maybe the Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) shows them arriving but not leaving, which could mean that the president never left via the elevator, supporting that he was pushed off. But that doesn't contradict the testimony. Wait, the testimony says that Gravelle pushed him off the roof two nights ago, leading to his body being found on the film lot. But the photo taken yesterday (Evidence 9) shows the film lot without the body. Therefore, the body couldn't have been there two nights ago; the murder must have happened after the photo was taken, hence contradicting the timeline. So Evidence 9 (Behind-the-Scenes Photo) contradicts Testimony 1 (murder two nights ago). But according to the numbering, Testimony 1 is \"Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof...\" So the contradiction is between Evidence 9 and Testimony 1. But the user's options include testimony numbers 0-3. Let me check the exact testimony numbers again.\n\nThe user's testimonies are:\n\nTestimony 0: \"Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Bigg Building.\" (Lang)\n\nTestimony 1: \"Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot.\" (Lang)\n\nTestimony 2: \"At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two.\" (Lang)\n\nTestimony 3: \"There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!\" (Lang)\n\nEvidence 9 is the Behind-the-Scenes Photo taken yesterday (April 5th?), showing no body or footprints. If the president was killed two nights ago (Testimony 1), the body would have been there yesterday when the photo was taken, but it's not. Therefore, Evidence 9 contradicts Testimony 1.\n\nBut the user's answer expects the evidence and testimony indices. The evidence index for the Behind-the-Scenes Photo is 9, and the testimony index is 1. So the JSON would be {\"evidence\": 9, \"testimony\": 1}.\n\nWait, but in the given problem, the user might have different numbering. Let me double-check the evidence list. Evidence 9 is \"Behind-the-Scenes Photo: Photo taken yesterday. No monster footprints and no body were visible at that point.\" Yes. So if Lang's testimony 1 says the murder was two nights ago, but the photo taken yesterday (the day before the current day, April 6th) shows no body, then the murder must have happened after the photo was taken, i.e., last night. Therefore, the evidence contradicts the testimony's timeline. So the correct pair is Evidence 9 and Testimony 1. However, the user might have a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) which shows the president and Gravelle arriving but not leaving. If the murder happened two nights ago, but the president's body was found today (April 6th), then perhaps the body wasn't discovered until today. But the photo from yesterday (Evidence 9) would show no body, so the murder must have occurred after the photo was taken, i.e., yesterday night or today. So Lang's claim that the murder happened two nights ago (Testimony 1) is contradicted by Evidence 9. Therefore, the correct answer is Evidence 9 and Testimony 1.\n\nBut the user might think that the answer is Evidence 9 and Testimony 1. However, the user's example answer uses the format {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}, so I need to make sure the indices are correct. Let me check the evidence list again:\n\nEvidence 9: Behind-the-Scenes Photo\n\nTestimony 1: Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof...\n\nTherefore, the answer should be {\"evidence\": 9, \"testimony\": 1}."

It's emblazoned with the mark of the Yatagarasu and it really stands out. I doubt there are any thieves who would actually wear it. Lotta: So, what are y'all gonna do now? I reckon... yer through bein' a prosecutor, right? Edgeworth: Yes... that's true, I suppose. (I'm no longer a prosecutor. However...) Kay: You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right? Edgeworth: Indeed... de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: (This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...) Lotta: Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off! Kay: That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop? Lotta: What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves... ???: S-Someone! Help! Kay: Yikes! What's that!? ???: S-Someone! P-Please help! Edgeworth: (Hmm. This woman is...) What's happened!? ???: S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...! Edgeworth: (A... monster?) Lotta: I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me! ???: Please follow me! It's this way! Kay: Has something else happened? Again!? Edgeworth: I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now. April 6, 10:05 AMOutside Bigg BuildingTemporary Film Lot Kay: Eh!? These are...!? Lotta: G-Genuine hoofprints! Edgeworth: (Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Look! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang...! Why is he here?) Kay: Ah! Someone's on the ground! Edgeworth: (It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!) Lang: ........ Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Lang: ......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here. Edgeworth: What happened? Lang: What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know! Edgeworth: (It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?) Lotta: It's a m... m... monster! Edgeworth: A... monster? Lotta: Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the Mighty Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Mighty... Moozilla...?) Lotta: This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! \"Man Trampled to Death by Monster!\" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper! Edgeworth: (What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?) Huang: I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis. Edgeworth: The real assassin was you all along...! de Killer: That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life... Edgeworth: (That man... could he have...?) Lang: Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body? ???: Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well. Edgeworth: (! Agent Lang?) Lang: Lang Zi says: \"First come, first suspected.\" You! Did you really just discover the body!? ???: O-O-O-O-O-Of course! Kay: Please calm down! You're scaring her! Edgeworth: (He does seem to have lost his composure...) Lang: Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. This isn't like you. Lang: ! Edgeworth: When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men? Lang: What... did you say...? Edgeworth: Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong? Lang: ........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation. Edgeworth: (Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too! Edgeworth: Yes. Let us investigate. (Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...) Lotta: What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the \"man\" behind it, more like the \"monster\" behind it, ya know? Edgeworth: Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation? Lotta: Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop! ???: Umm... Excuse me. Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...) ???: You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me? Edgeworth: Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before... Kay: Huh? Do you know her? Edgeworth: Yes, I do. (At least I think I do...) Kay: My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! Penny: My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you. Edgeworth: (Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...) It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is... Penny: Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body... Edgeworth: I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police? Penny: Y-Yes! Right away! Edgeworth: (I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things besides the body that concern me. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...) Begin Investigation Outside Bigg BuildingTemporary Film Lot Logic \"Rear entrance forced open\" and \"Combination lock\" Edgeworth: The front entrance, which leads to the Tower Plaza, was locked with a combination lock. At the other hand... the lock on the rear entrance, which leads to the Bigg Building, was broken. Now, where does this lead us? Kay: Heh heh heh! I know this one! The culprit entered from the rear entrance, right!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And knowing this... we now understand one more critical fact. The culprit must be someone who didn't know the number to unlock the combination lock. Kay: Right! If they knew the code, it would've been way easier to enter from the front entrance! Entering through the back door is common sense for a thief. It's much less conspicuous. We can't underestimate a culprit who thinks like a thief! Please keep your guard up! Edgeworth: (She sure becomes lively all of a sudden when this subject gets brought up...) To put it simply, everyone involved with the movie knows the combination for the lock. In other words, it's quite likely that the culprit is someone who is not involved with the film. Combination Lock data jotted down in my Organizer. \"Dented fence\" and \"Broken horn\" Edgeworth: The dent in this fence... and the broken horn... Neither of these things were there yesterday evening. Based on the fact that these two things have changed... Kay: Ah! Could Moozilla's head have...!? Edgeworth: Indeed. The head that was on the rooftop (Monster's head - It may have rolled off the studio roof and tumbled to the ground.) may have tumbled down onto the ground. This is a new possibility. (Which would mean that...) \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Edgeworth: We may have found the missing murder weapon... Kay: Eh! Really!? Edgeworth: At the moment, I can only say that it is just a possibility... If the giant monster head had fallen off from the studio roof... Kay: Ah! That could definitely be a murder weapon! Ms. Nichols, may we investigate the studio roof? Penny: The roof? OK, I understand! Go on ahead! But the stairs can be a little bit slippery, so please watch your step! Partner Kay: Yeah, what's up? Notice anything? Kay: I still can't believe the president has been murdered... Do you think he was really trampled to death by a monster? Edgeworth: Surely you can't be serious? There are no such things as monsters. Kay: Whaaat!? So it wasn't a monster who did this? Then, who do you say killed the president!? Edgeworth: As the president of Zheng Fa, I'm sure there are more than a few people targeting his life. Just like Shelly de Killer tried to do, not too long ago. Kay: So, you think he was killed by someone like Mr. de Killer? Edgeworth: I can't say for certain yet... but neither can I deny that possibility. Kay: But, we can't deny the possibility of him being killed by a monster, either! I mean, just take a look at all these monster's footprints! Plus, a horn-like object was lying on the ground next to the president. Edgeworth: (A horn-like object...? I can't say for certain that it's not related to this case. Perhaps I should take a moment and compare it with the evidence I have on hand.) Agent Lang Kay: I never would have thought we'd run into Mr. Lang in a place like this! But, he didn't seem to be in a very good mood though. Edgeworth: It's understandable. Agent Lang is from the Republic of Zheng Fa. With President's Huang's death, he must have a lot on his mind. Kay: Come to think of it, he doesn't have his men-in-black in tow with him today either. I always picture him with an army of subordinates following him around... Edgeworth: (Agent Lang... I wonder if something has happened to him?) Moozilla (after examining broken lock and talking about \"Broken horn\" with Penny) Edgeworth: Did you already know about this \"Moozilla\" monster? Kay: Nope. I just learned about it today! I mean, the movie came out 12 years ago, right? Back then, I was just a cute little girl! But, the \"Mighty Moozilla\" sure does sound pretty sweet! Edgeworth: Heh... It certainly does seem like the kind of movie you would enjoy. Kay: Well, duh, it's a giant monster! What's not to like about giant monsters!? Edgeworth: I for one can't understand the appeal of these so-called \"giant monsters\". Kay: Well, I don't get what's so great about the Steel Samurai! Edgeworth: Ugh...! Kay! I'll have you know, the Steel Samurai is... Kay: Yeah, yeah. More importantly, shouldn't we get back to our investigation now? Why don't we take a minute to reorganize any information we haven't yet put together? We might be able to make a new connection! Edgeworth: Yes... Indeed. Present Yatagarasu's Badge Kay: Eureka! Seeing this badge... just gave me a great idea! As a token of appreciation for everything you've done for me, Mr. Edgeworth... ...I'm gonna carve an awesome badge for you out of an eraser. Should I carve your face from the side? Or from the front? Hmm, maybe a diagonal view... Edgeworth: (Why are you so set on the theme being my face...?) Kay: Ah! But if it's something new you want, how about a view from directly below? Edgeworth: (This badge has quickly gone from \"awesome\" to \"awful\"...) Letter from Unknown or Bigg Building Kay: When my memory was gone, I... ...I felt like I was walking through a freezing rain the entire time. But, when it all came back... Edgeworth: ...Did something happen when you regained your memory? Kay: Nope... It's nothing. Thank you so very much! Edgeworth: ...Kay. I am not the one who recovered your memories. The person you should thank is the one who had you write in that notebook. Kay: Daddy! Mr. Edgeworth! Thank you both so much! ...Eheheh. I feel a lot better now! Edgeworth: If you're going to shout, please give a little more consideration to the time and place... Crime Scene Notes Kay: Mr. President... We only just exposed the fake assassination, I can't believe he was really assassinated... Edgeworth: Indeed. It's quite tragic, but no matter how you look at it, this time he's truly gone. Our final parting gift to him will be uncovering the truth behind this case. Kay: That's right. This'll be... a paycheck for the president! Edgeworth: I think you mean \"payback\", Kay. Monster Movie Flyer, Moozilla's Head, or Moozilla Doll Kay: The Mighty Moozilla vs Gourdy! What an earth-shattering battle that would be! Gourdy tries to devour Moozilla! But, the horns get caught, so it can't swallow Moozilla whole! Moozilla tries biting back! But, Gourdy's skin is really slick, so Moozilla can't chomp down. Oh, this kind of buildup always gets my heart pounding! Edgeworth: (I'll never understand why today's youth get so invested in these things...) Anything else Kay: I believe that even a Great Thief has rights. For example, we have the right to choose what we want to steal. Edgeworth: (I guess she doesn't consider this valuable.) Monster costume Edgeworth: There is a monster costume in front of this building. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is that really a costume? Maybe it's actually the monster who made all these footprints, and it just shrunk itself down! Edgeworth: ......I'll say this one more time, so listen carefully. There is a monster costume in front of this building. It's just a costume! Lighting equipment Edgeworth: This seems to be the lighting equipment they're using for the film. Kay: ...Ah, that's right! There's something I wanted to ask you, Mr. Edgeworth! When I'm stealing something, can you use this to make me look cool in a spotlight? Edgeworth: You want someone to shine a light on you when you're stealing something? Kay: Well, duh! If the Yatagarasu's handiwork can't be seen because it's too dark... ...wouldn't you feel bad for the people watching? Edgeworth: (You're planning to steal things with an audience looking on...?) Penny Nichols Penny: I'm sorry about earlier... I was... a little flustered. Discovery of the body Edgeworth: Were you here alone? Penny: Yes. I arrived before everyone else today in order to get things prepared. When I entered the lot, I immediately noticed... those giant hoofprints. Kay: The monster's footprints, right!? Weren't you surprised? Penny: Yes. Because they hadn't been there yesterday evening. Edgeworth: (So that means the footprints were made last night...) Penny: Well, when I first saw them, I thought they were a part of the set. But, when I got closer to the studio, I saw that a person had collapsed. Edgeworth: You didn't notice until you got closer...? Penny: Lately, it seems my eyesight has gotten worse again, and my glasses aren't strong enough. As I approached the body, I finally realized what it was. I was so scared, I ran away. Edgeworth: (And that was when she ran into us...) Filming a movie Edgeworth: You said they were... filming a movie? Could it be... the Steel Samurai...? Penny: No. Edgeworth: (So it wasn't...) Penny: We're making a monster movie this time around. Have you ever hears of the \"Mighty Moozilla\" series? Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but no... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth isn't interested in anything other than the Steel Samurai after all! Edgeworth: Th-That's not... Penny: I guess that's to be expected, as the promotion for the film hasn't really started yet. \"The Mighty Moozilla! Its revival breaks its 12 years of silence!\" It's the long awaited sequel to the original series, so the staff are all fired up! The film is set at the Bigg Building, so we're filming on location around this area. Edgeworth: (Come to think of it, yesterday...) Gumshoe: What's wrong, pal!? Did something happen at the Bigg Building!? Cuuuuuut! Cut, cut, cut, cuuuut! ???: E-Excuse me! We're sort of in the middle of shooting a movie, and umm... Edgeworth: (I saw them filming something then. It must have been this...) Kay: I bet it ends with Moozilla completely destroying the Bigg Building! Penny: Tee-hee. I wonder? You'll have to look forward to finding out in the theaters. If you like, you can have this. Edgeworth: Hmm. Let's see... The Battle of the Century! Now... it meets its greatest rival! \"Mighty Moozilla vs Gourdy\" Edgeworth: (Wait... Gourdy?) Penny: This time, it won't just be Moozilla, a rival monster appears as well! Have you heard of it? Gourdy of Gourd Lake. Kay: Ah! Wasn't it the talk of the town two or three years ago? It's a mysterious monster living in Gourd Lake! By chance, someone took a photo of it! Edgeworth: (It wasn't just the talk of the town, it was also involved in a case from my past. Gourdy... huh. Now there's a name I don't really want to remember.) Penny: When the director caught wind of that rumor, he decided to add it into the story. Edgeworth: (I get the feeling he was a bit late to catch on...) Penny: Please look forward to seeing the showdown between these two rival monsters! Monster Movie Flyer data jotted down in my Organizer. After examining horn Edgeworth: (Is there anything out of place with what I've investigated so far?) The entrance Edgeworth: (I should confirm what the security situation was like at the scene of the crime.) Ms. Nichols. Was the entrance to this place locked? Penny: Yes. It's locked with this. Kay: It's one of those types where you have to put in the correct numbers to open it, right? Edgeworth: About this combination lock, was it also properly locked today? Penny: Yes. When I arrived here today, it was locked tight. Edgeworth: Who knows the combination? Penny: The producer, the director, the staff, and the actors... I think everyone involved in the movie knew about it. Edgeworth: (So anyone involved with the film could have opened the combination lock (Combination lock - Used on front entrance. Only the cast and crew knew the combination.) and gone in.) Broken horn Edgeworth: About this horn... Have you ever seen it before? Penny: Huh? That's Moozilla's horn. It's a model we made to use in our ad campaign. ...Where was it? Edgeworth: It was on the ground by the back entrance. Penny: That's strange... Moozilla's head should have been stored on the studio roof. Edgeworth: I suppose the head would have to be rather large, wouldn't it? Penny: Yes! It's not as big as the real thing, of course, but it's still quite large! Look. You can see it from here. See? It's right there. Edgeworth: It certainly is large... (Broken horn - Was lying next to the body. Had been stored on the roof last night.) Present Monster's Footprints Penny: ...If I remember correctly, the Moozilla in our film also has split hooves. Edgeworth: Surely, you're not suggesting that the president was trampled to death by a monster? Penny: Oh, no! Rather, speaking as a member of the studio staff... ...I don't believe Moozilla would commit a murder. Giant monsters only bother the people in the movies. That's the cardinal rule for those involved in monster movies. Edgeworth: (Indeed. It would be problematic if it weren't that way.) Monster Movie Flyer or Moozilla's Head Penny: Moozilla is a symbol of nature. That's why it destroys cities. Edgeworth: (That's a rather sketchy explanation...) Penny: It uses its horns to attack, but that's not its only technique. It has a Sonic Moo sound wave attack, a sticky drool spray, dual milk shooters... ...a BBQ smokescreen diversion, and a leather shows & bags production line ultra combo. Kay: The more you describe it... the less powerful it sounds. Penny: Well, making it look powerful is a job for us filmmakers, after all! Edgeworth: (...Won't the producers of the movie get mad at them?) Anything else Penny: Ahh! Th-That's! Edgeworth: Hmm? Do you know something about this? Penny: Huh...? I-I'm sorry! I think I was just mistaken. Lately, the prescription of my glasses hasn't been quite right. I deeply apologize for my shameful behavior! Edgeworth: (That's not something you need to apologize for...) (Clearing \"Discovery of the body\", \"Filming a movie\", \"The entrance\" and \"Broken horn\" \"Talk\" option before examining film crane and vinyl sheets leads to:) Kay: There sure are a lot of interesting things around here! Penny: Tee-hee. It's the equipment we use for filming. The Moozilla costume and the camera crane. Kay: They really are treasures! I'm getting kinda excited! Edgeworth: (It's possible that some of this equipment was used in the crime... I'd better take a closer look.) Shi-Long Lang Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. So we meet again. Edgeworth: Indeed. Just a few days ago, we met at the detention center... Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What brings you here? Lang: Just some boring work. Nothing you need to know about. Lang: Tch. You always pick the worst time to show up. Anyone ever tell you that bad things happen when you're around? Just don't get in the way of my investigation, OK? I must avenge the death of our president... Why were you here? Edgeworth: You arrived here before us... What were you doing in a place like this? Lang: .....You suspect me? Edgeworth: Heh... Come now. Lang: I heard a scream. It was the woman who found the body... After hearing the scream, I came in through that entrance over there. Apparently, it wasn't locked. Edgeworth: (Then why is there a lock on the ground over there...? I should take a closer look.) Lang: When I got in... ...woman who found the body was already running out the other exit over there. Edgeworth: (So he came here around the same time we did...) Why were you at the Bigg Building? Lang: Well... I had my reasons... Edgeworth: (...He also said something along those lines when we met at the detention center.) Kay: Maybe he's really a fan of giant monsters, and he came to sneak a peek at the Moozilla set? Lang: ...Giant monsters? I've no interest in such things. Edgeworth: (He clearly doesn't think the murderer is a monster either.) President Huang Edgeworth: It's regrettable what happened to the president... Lang: ...Yeah. Huang was the pride of Zheng Fa. And yet... Edgeworth: It seems like you were quite close to the president. Lang: The previous head of the Lang clan, my father, served under President Huang. Protecting the life of the president has long been our clan's greatest duty. My old man received a great number of special medals from the president himself... As a token of his trust, the president left his will in the protection of the Lang clan. Those medals and that will, they were the pride of our clan. Our family treasures, so to speak. Tch. Who would've thought the day to unseal that will... would arrive so soon! Kay: So then. I guess the president was like a close family friend... ...Huh? But during the incident at Gourd Lake... ...why weren't you with the president, Mr. Lang? Lang: ......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: (12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?) Lang: Even so, I still respect the man. Zheng Fa is a small country. But he carried the nation with his strength. Damn it! Just what were his bodyguards doing!? Edgeworth: Have you already contacted the embassy? Lang: Yeah, of course. I've also informed Zheng Fa and my clan as well. It's gotten pretty hectic there, what with the will and all... ...but it'll be the same here. Once the bodyguards show up. If you don't wanna see me rip into them, I suggest you get out of here soon. Present Yatagarasu's Badge Lang: That's what the little crow-girl's always wearing on her clothes, isn't it? Kay: It represents the most powerful animal in nature, my Yatagarasu Badge. Isn't it awesome!? Lang: Most powerful animal in nature...? Not so fast. I can't let that one slide. Lang Zi says: \"The wolf is mightier than the crow.\" Just one slash from a wolf's claw and your little crow would be nevermore. Kay: Take that back, Wolfy! Thief Girl says: \"The crow soars above all others.\" I'll swoop in to peck the wolf to pieces and then fly back up to avoid the wolf's claws! Lang: Don't underestimate a wolf's jumping ability! It'll bite the crow before it can fly away! Kay: A crow can flap its wings so hard, it'll blow the big bad wolf away! Lang: Grrrrr... Kay: Kaw kaw-kaw-kaw... Edgeworth: (They're squabbling like children.) Monster's Footprints or Monster Movie Flyer Lang: Tch. Moozilla? What're you asking me about that for? Edgeworth: I won't say the culprit is a monster, but it seems a little too early to say it's unrelated. If you know anything, then by all means, please tell me. Lang: Hmph. The president always had a Moozilla doll with him. I've caught a glimpse of it on occasion. That's how I knew. Edgeworth: (A Moozilla doll, huh... Indeed, there was one inside the president's plane.) Kay: So even a foreign president was a fan. Moozilla sure has international appeal. You know how different countries have different sounds for animal noises? So, I wonder what kind of sounds a foreign Moozilla would make? Edgeworth: (I don't even know what kind of sound a domestic Moozilla would make...) Crime Scene Notes Lang: Damn it! You don't have to show me that! Whoever killed the president... ...you can be damned well sure I'm gonan catch 'em! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang... Whenever President Huang is brought up, he seems to lose his composure.) Kay: I kinda feel bad for Mr. Lang... Isn't there anything we can do for him? Edgeworth: Yes. And it is for that reason we must listen carefully to what he has to say. Anything else Lang: You keep shoving irrelevant nonsense under my nose... ...and I'll chew it to pieces! Edgeworth: (Hmm... I think I should put this away for now.) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options leads to:) Lang: ...Mr. Prosecutor. Right now, I'm just a single Interpol agent. A literal lone wolf. They probably won't let me be in charge of the investigation. But you better believe... my fangs are as sharp as ever...! I'd definitely capture the culprit with my own hands. And you'd better not get in my way. Body Kay: Wow... It really is the president. Edgeworth: Yes. (To think we saw him alive just a few days ago...) Kay: That would make this a presidential assassination, right? Edgeworth: This is a bit flashy for an assassination... Before deducing and examining ground and body Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) After deducing and examining ground and body Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Ground around the body Kay: There are broken pieces of concrete scattered all around the president. Edgeworth: Yes. They were probably scattered about when the ground got damaged. Kay: And that must have been when the monster's foot went \"Thud!\" Edgeworth: If the culprit... was actually a monster. Monster's Footprints data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Hmm... It kinda looks like a hoof, the way it's split in two like that! Yup, it definitely looks like a monster's footprint to me! And there's even three of them (Three footprints - There are three footprints at the scene. They are shaped like hooves.), Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: There are no such things as monsters. Do you honestly believe they exist? Kay: No, not really... but wouldn't it be cool if they did exist!? Edgeworth: ...We're searching for the truth, Kay. Not for what is cool. Body Edgeworth: There are no visible external wounds... but it's clear that he's already passed away. Kay: So then, I guess he really did get stepped on by a... a... Edgeworth: A monster (Stepped on by a monster? - The president was found dead in the middle of what looks like a footprint.)...? Hmph. That's impossible. Kay: Huh? Don't the president's clothes look a bit dirty to you? Edgeworth: Indeed, there appears to be some sort of yellow stain... Kay: I bet it's monster drool! Edgeworth: Kay, please be more serious. We'll need to have forensics take a closer look at this stain. (So, this was the state of the body... I should make a note of it.) Crime Scene Notes jotted down in my Organizer. Horn Kay: What's this white thing...? W-Wait! Is this a bone!? Looks like we've got a new case on our hands! Edgeworth: It looks less like a bone... and more like some kind of horn. Deduce (after talking about \"Filming a movie\") Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Deduce horn and present Monster Movie Flyer Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Doesn't this horn belong to that monster, Moozilla?\" Otherwise Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's a connection between this spot and the evidence... I think! Kay: Huh! What's the connection!? Edgeworth: Hmph... That's what I'm going to figure out right now. Kay: What!? You haven't figured it out yet!? Edgeworth: Nngh! (I guess that was wrong. Wasn't there something that fell near the victim that was bothering me? I should look into that before going any further.) Edgeworth: Doesn't this horn belong to that monster, Moozilla? Kay: You're right! It looks just like it! Maybe it's a prop for the film? Edgeworth: Based on the size of the horn... the head should be quite large. Kay: I wonder how it ended up here. Edgeworth: I'm sure we'll find out if we ask someone on the staff. Lotta Hart Lotta: Whaddaya want!? I'm a busy gal! Ya best not get in my way! Edgeworth: Why are you so obsessed with that monster? Such a thing couldn't possibly exist... Lotta: What'd ya say...!? I ain't lettin' that pass! Moozilla lives! I'm sure of it! It's the mightiest monster on this side of the Pacific Rim. Edgeworth: I don't suppose you have some kind of basis for that? Lotta: I..... saw it with my own two eyes. Kay: What!? You saw it...? No way... Lotta: Yes way! The Mighty Moozilla was really here! Last night, when I was on the 51st floor of the Bigg Building. Edgeworth: You mean when you were snooping around the black market auction... Lotta: That's right! It was right around when I took this here photo! Kay: That's the photo of the person in the red hood! This was Jill Crane, right? Lotta: Ya see those blinds next to the red hood... Well, the Mighty Moozilla was on the other side! Kay: .......Err. But there's nothing in the photo... Lotta: It's mighty hard to capture somethin' like that from such a distance! But I seen it plain as day! Moozilla's giant eye eas peerin' in through those blinds! Edgeworth: (The monster was peering in?) Lotta: Lookie here! Now ain't the time for this! I gotta gather my materials! Ya'll are in my way! Now go on, git! Shoo! Shoo! Edgeworth: (How absurd...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you must be completely dumbfounded right now, aren't you? Edgeworth: (Hmph. Was it that clearly written on my face?) Film crane Kay: ...I wonder what this iron pole is for? Oh, maybe it's used to practice tree climbing? Edgeworth: No, this is a film crane. It's used to capture footage from high locations. Right now it's not attached, but normally there would be a camera connected to the end. Kay: I get it! This would be perfect for scoping out the places you're trying to steal from...! Do you think they would let me borrow this? Edgeworth: And how exactly, may I ask, do you intend to bring it back home with you? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you can take the base, and I'll take the top part... Edgeworth: (...Does she actually expect me to help her?) Kay: If we take it nice and slow... we might be able to make it to your house, Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: (...Not only do you want me to help you carry it, but you plan to leave it at my house!?) Vinyl sheets Kay: Ah! It's one of those sheets you lay out on the floor when you're having a picnic! Edgeworth: It's definitely a vinyl sheet, however... (I don't think it's for picnics.) Penny: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth. I-If I may... That's actually a waterproof sheet. It's used with the camera crane over there. We'll cover the camera crane with it when it's raining. Kay: Then, this sheet... must be pretty big. Penny: Yes. It would be pointless if we didn't cover up the entire crane. The weather was overcast yesterday, so we've been using it quite a bit. Broken lock Edgeworth: Ms. Nichols, where does this entrance lead to...? Penny: It's connected to the Bigg Building lot. Edgeworth: (Does this case also have something to do with that building? The building with a secret 51st floor, where the black market auctions were being held. It wouldn't be strange if it were still hiding a few more secrets...) Bigg Building data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: (Hm? This lock and chain...?) Kay: Ah! Someone cut through the chain! Penny: What? I'm sure it was locked up properly yesterday though. Edgeworth: Then, it's possible the culprit forced his way in through here... (Rear entrance forced open - The chain on the rear entrance was cut. Did the culprit do it?) Penny: Ahh! Edgeworth: (Wh-What is it...?) Penny: It's completely dented in... How did this happen!? Edgeworth: ...Hmm. There is indeed a huge dent in the fence over there. Something rather heavy must have struck it, in order to make a dent like that. Penny: It wasn't like that at all yesterday... Edgeworth: (It wasn't...? So this dent (Dented fence - Yesterday it was still fine. Did it get struck by something heavy?) was made last night...) Broken lock (subsequent times) Edgeworth: This leads to the Bigg Building. Kay: But from where I'm standing, all I can see are just your everyday run-of-the-mill buildings. I don't see anyone special around here either. Edgeworth: Indeed. At least from where we're standing, that is. ...Now then, we have no time to waste. We should get back to investigating the film lot. (Connecting \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Logic leads to:) Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check... Edgeworth: (Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?) Hm? ???: ........ ........ Lang: ........ ???: .....Move it. Lang: What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners. ???: ...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already. Lang: ! Penny: I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, John! Lang: Tch! Penny: Oh! What were you doing!? ???: .......Who was that? Penny: Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him? ???: Hmph. Kay: That sure was a tense standoff! Edgeworth: (He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...) Penny: Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is John Marsh. He's the lead actor in our movie. Edgeworth: (The lead actor... is this child?) Kay: Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you! Edgeworth: And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. John: .......Prosecutor? Penny: He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know. John: But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge. Edgeworth: Gah! (He's frightfully perceptive...) Penny: Ah! John, it's probably better if you didn't go over there... John: ............ Edgeworth: (That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.) Upstairs Edgeworth: May we see the roof? Penny: Yes, of course! Go right ahead! Edgeworth: (So, this is... Moozilla?) Kay: Huh? Somehow this doesn't feel quite right... See, this looks way cooler. ...And he doesn't have a nose ring either. Penny: Ah, I see. You two aren't familiar with Moozilla. This is Moozilla's original design from 12 years ago! Kay: Whaaat!? Th-Then, what's this? Penny: That's our take on it for the new movie. We revamped the design to appeal to modern audiences! Kay: \"Revamped\"...? But it looks totally different! And, no matter how you look at this one... Edgeworth: ...it's a cow... Penny: Well, of course. After all, Moozilla was originally a cow monster. Kay: A c-cow monster...? Penny: Having a cow, an animal that humans are very familiar with, turn into a monster... ...allows us to question mankind's relationship with nature! That's the theme of Moozilla. Kay: ......Meh. I just don't get it. Edgeworth: Nor do I... Before examining model and table Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) After examining model and table Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Heater Kay: There's a heater here. Do you think the staff uses it to keep themselves warm? Edgeworth: It's possible. Although it may be spring, it can still get rather chilly at night. Kay: M-Mr. Edgeworth! People are gonna think you're an old geezer if you say stuff like that! Even in the best of times, you tend to see things like an old man... Can't you at least TRY to be more cheerful and lively when you talk? Edgeworth: (Do I really seem that unlively...?) Paint thinner Edgeworth: There is a can of paint thinner here. It's probably used for making props. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, doesn't the area around here look kinda burnt? Edgeworth: It does. This spread-out blue sheet, newspaper, and the side of this can all look burnt. Kay: Hmm. I wonder if this Moozilla's head can also shoot out flames? Well, this old Moozilla design doesn't really look like it could breathe fire anyways. Edgeworth: (That's not our main concern... but I'm certainly curious.) Model Penny: We made this replica of the original Moozilla's head for promotional purposes. We'll be using it to let people know that the film is a sequel to the original series. Kay: I guess it would be hard for people to tell that they're the same monster. Edgeworth: As we suspected, one of the horns appears to be broken... Kay: So, did this head really crush the president? Edgeworth: It's possible, however... there's something I don't quite understand. Kay: What's that? Edgeworth: Ms. Nichols. This head looks rather heavy... How do you transport it? Penny: Ah, it's made so that it can be taken apart. It's not that hard, if you know how to do it. But, if you don't know how, it'd be pretty much impossible, I think. Edgeworth: (Which means it would be difficult for anyone not involved in the film...) When taken apart, would it be possible for one person to carry it alone? Penny: Definitely. Given enough time, even I could do it! Moozilla's Head data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: (However, this face is...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. Umm... I feel like I've seen this cow somewhere before... Edgeworth: Indeed. I was just thinking the exact same thing. (It was on board the president's plane... ...and in the storeroom of the black market auction...) The president's stuffed toy... Kay: So, that was a doll of the original Moozilla... Edgeworth: (Could this really be just a coincidence?) Moozilla Doll data jotted down in my Organizer. Model (subsequent times) Kay: Since he had a Moozilla doll with him, maybe the president was a big fan. And, his love for Moozilla was so great that he tried picking up the head and got crushed. Edgeworth: I doubt a normal person would have the strength to lift this up. Since he wasn't involved with the movie, he wouldn't have known how to take it apart. Kay: Hmm. If Moozilla really existed, that would explain everything though... Can't you just connect the pieces in that direction for once...? With logic, I mean. Edgeworth: Please don't give me that look. Table Edgeworth: Some sort of wooden stand has fallen over. The area around it seems to be burnt black. Penny: Huh? Moozilla's head should have been on that stand... Kay: But, the legs have broken off... It doesn't look like it can be used anymore. Edgeworth: Hmm. The broken legs seem to be badly burnt. I think it's safe to assume that a small fire occurred here. Kay: A small fire, huh? Is that what burnt and broke the legs of the stand? Edgeworth: When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand... Kay: ...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire! Edgeworth: Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness. Penny: Oooh... I'm sorry. I'll make sure this doesn't happen again...! But, I don't think anyone used the heater yesterday... Edgeworth: (I see. In that case... I wonder what caused the fire?) Light stand Kay: I could probably carry a light stand of this size on my shoulder. Edgeworth: Kay. Don't tell me you're planning to steal this. Kay: Of course not! But if I carried this around with me... ...I could shine a spotlight on you whenever you shout \"Objection\"! Man, that sounds so cool! ...So, when should we start? Edgeworth: Never, please. Penny Nichols Present Moozilla Doll Penny: Ah, that's a first-generation Moozilla plushie! ...So you knew about it? Edgeworth: No. I only happened to see the doll. I didn't know anything about the films. Kay: I think this is much cuter than the head on the roof. It's a little dirty though. Penny: That can't be helped. Those were sold quite a long time ago, after all. Back then, it was aimed at children, and it seems to have had moderate success. I heard a lot of them were sold as presents. Kay: If someone gave me one as a present, I'd want the new and improved version of Moozilla. If someone were to give me a present, that is! Edgeworth: (Why is she looking at me when she says that...?) Commemorative Photo Penny: Ah. It's the photo that John brought. Kay: Who took this photo? Penny: The camera has a self-timer. We took it with just the three of us. Edgeworth: So, about the third person... Just who is in that Moozilla costume in the background? Penny: That's... actually, rather than me telling you, it'd be better if you found out for yourself. I think they'll be outside the studio lot, so if you get a chance later, please go there. Edgeworth: Hmm. Later... huh. Understood. We'll do that. John Marsh John: ............ Edgeworth: John was it? Would you mind if I asked you a few questions? John: ...Hey old man, you really a prosecutor? Edgeworth: Yes. (Hmph. Old man...?) John: Then, first show me your prosecutor's badge. Edgeworth: I don't have my badge with me right now... John: Then, you can't prove you're a prosecutor, old man. Edgeworth: Ngh! Kay: Hmm. This kind is a tough nut to crack, isn't he? Want me to give it a try? Edgeworth: Yes. I'm counting on you Kay. (I'm not good with kids...) John Marsh Kay: So John, you're an actor? John: .....Yeah. What about it? Kay: You're amazing! That's so cool! John: .....N-Not really. Edgeworth: (Hmph. Good grief. At least that seems to have worked.) Kay: Umm, about those horns... John: ...Wh-What about them? Penny: John's horns are specially made prosthetics. John plays a young boy who has a special connection with Moozilla. He can communicate with Moozilla using those horns. Right, John? John: Shut up. Stop blabbering about that stupid stuff! Penny: Ooh... S-Sorry. Edgeworth: (I think I'm beginning to see the kind of relationship these two have...) Kay: But it must be amazing! To star in a movie! And you're only in elementary school! John: Penny: Ah! D-Despite how he looks, John is 13 years old and he's already in middle school... Kay: Whaaat! But... he's so small. And he's wearing a kiddy backpack! Penny: The backpack is a part of his costume. He's an actor, after all. Kay: I-I see. But... he's still really tiny. Penny: I-It's probably better if you didn't talk about his height in front of... John: I thought I told you to stop blabbering about stupid stuff! Penny: S-Sorry! Edgeworth: (It seems the only thing that's not a prop is that milk carton.) The president (appears after John Marsh) John: That guy over there... He's the president, right? Kay: Yup. Do you know him? John: .....Yeah. I've met him before. Edgeworth: (This boy... has met with the president?) John: .....Hmph. That guy makes me sick. Kay: Th-That's not a very nice thing to say. Why do you hate the president so much? John: ........ Kay: Huh... And now he's giving me the silent treatment... Penny: U-Um! The truth is, the president was involved in the film. Edgeworth: The president was involved in the film? What do you mean? Penny: He was supposed to have a brief cameo in the movie. He came by to look around the set some time ago. That was when he met with John. Edgeworth: Why would the president be appearing in this film? Penny: We heard he was a fan of the original Moozilla series... And so we made him an offer. We thought it would make great publicity, you see. John: ...He comes on the movie set like he's on some sightseeing tour. It's so annoying. Penny: John, you really shouldn't say stuff like that. It's not nice. John: ...Shut it. Edgeworth: (I guess he couldn't tolerate having an amateur appear in his film...) Present Monster Movie Flyer, Moozilla's Head, Moozilla Doll, or Commemorative Photo John: Moozilla only exists in the movies... For it to become an actual incident... The thought never even crossed my mind. Edgeworth: John. I'd like you to cooperate with the investigation. John: Hmph. In that case, maybe you should make me care enough to cooperate, old man. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's not very approachable.) Kay: John! If you cooperate with us, I'll give you some delicious candy! John: You think that'll work on me? Don't treat me like a kid! Kay: Aww. Even my candy crush attack didn't work. What a bummer. Edgeworth: (...Candy crush attack?) Anything else John: What's that supposed to be? Giving me that isn't gonna land you a role in the film. Edgeworth: (I wasn't showing it to you so that I could be in the movie...) Kay: Hmm... So then, what do we have to do appear in the movie? Edgeworth: ...Kay, let's just leave it at that, shall we? (Clearing all \"Talk\" option leads to:) Penny: ...... John: ......Oh, right. Here. Penny: What's this? Ah, was this from yesterday? Edgeworth: (A photo...?) John: ...Yeah. Since it was developed, I brought it along with me. You can have it. Penny: I think it turned out quite nicely! So you brought it all the way here for me? Thank you so much. John: ...No, not really. I just happened to have it with me. Edgeworth: Excuse me, but... May I take a quick look at it? Penny: Oh, sure. Here you go! Edgeworth: (So this was taken yesterday... Neither the hoofprints nor the body are in it.) Commemorative Photo data jotted down in my Organizer. (Connecting all possible Logic, examining ground around the body, original Moozilla model and table, clearing all \"Talk\" options of Penny and John, and talking with Lotta leads to:) Investigation Complete Edgeworth: And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished. Kay: So the murder weapon really is... Edgeworth: Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high. Kay: So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh... Edgeworth: Hm? Lang: Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived. Bodyguard: Mr. President! Lang: They really were... far too late. Bodyguard: Damn it! Who did this!? Lang: ...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect. Edgeworth: What? What do you mean? Lang: Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation... Edgeworth: ...So they've already established a plan for this investigation? Lang: I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Bigg Building rooftop. Edgeworth: Th... This is! Lang: This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen! Kay: Wh-Why is Ms. Gravelle there!? Edgeworth: (So he's saying Judge Gravelle is the murder?) Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste! Edgeworth: (Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?) Security Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Lang: Lang: ............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Bigg Building. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a \"prosecutor\". Edgeworth: ! Lang: Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you? Edgeworth: (Hmph...!) Kay: Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!? Lang: .......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a \"prosecutor\"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case? Edgeworth: ........ (Why do I still continue to investigate...?) Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent? Lang: .......... Edgeworth: Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Bigg Building yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as \"prosecutor\" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed. Lang: ........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot. Edgeworth: (Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...) Lang: That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits! Edgeworth: You have my thanks... Lang: However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way! Edgeworth: Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way! Lang: Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into! -- Why Gravelle? -- Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Bigg Building. Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards? Lang: Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about. Edgeworth: (President Huang and Judge Gravelle... Did those two have some sort of connection?) Lang: Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Bigg Building. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president. Kay: Does that mean... the last person to see the president was... Lang: Exactly... Gravelle, you mean? It's gotta be her! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How can you be so sure that the two actually met? Lang: Hmph. Attacking right off the bat... Your fighter's instinct, it's not bad. Trying to keep me in check from the opening move. Impressive. Edgeworth: (No, that wasn't exactly my intention...) Lang: Still, Mr. Prosecutor, I've only just begun. So why don't you pipe down and listen up? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Two nights ago...? Are you certain? Lang: Hmph! If you doubt me, then take a look for yourself! This picture was taken by the security camera on the roof of the Bigg Building... This was undoubtedly taken the night before last! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: All this picture shows is that they went to the rooftop together. There's no indication of what transpired afterwards. Lang: The security cameras were only installed in front of the elevator. There's nothing to show what happened on the viewing platform, but... ...I'm certain of it! That was when the crime took place! Edgeworth: (Hmm. If the president really was murdered two nights ago... ...it would mean that the body has been here ever since.) Lang: What's wrong, Mr. Prosecutor? Something on your mind? But, it's not over yet. I'm just getting started. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Someone could have been hiding on the viewing platform! Kay: That's right! There was even a cotton candy stall up there! Lang: Lang: The owner of the building had been secretly contacted by the president. He could ill-afford any slip ups, so the owner frantically made sure secrecy was maintained. Everyone and everything was cleared out, including the sugar for the cotton candy! Kay: E... Even the sugar...? That's just too cruel! Lang: However, it was all for naught. The president still met his end... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you really think there is no room for doubt? Lang: Heh! Of course I do! The time, the place... Everything points to that woman committing the crime! Edgeworth: I see. The time and the place, everything... huh? (The time following the president's death and where his body was found... It seems I have reached the heart of the matter.) Edgeworth: (Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!)-- Why Gravelle? -- Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Bigg Building. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How can you be so sure that the two actually met? Lang: Hmph. Attacking right off the bat... Your fighter's instinct, it's not bad. Trying to keep me in check from the opening move. Impressive. Edgeworth: (No, that wasn't exactly my intention...) Lang: Still, Mr. Prosecutor, I've only just begun. So why don't you pipe down and listen up? Lang: Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Two nights ago...? Are you certain?

For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low.\" Lang: At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Someone could have been hiding on the viewing platform! Kay: That's right! There was even a cotton candy stall up there! Lang: Lang: The owner of the building had been secretly contacted by the president. He could ill-afford any slip ups, so the owner frantically made sure secrecy was maintained.

(The time following the president's death and where his body was found... It seems I have reached the heart of the matter.) Edgeworth: (Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Edgeworth: Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low. Lang: What'd you say...!? Edgeworth: This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios. Kay: Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for John. Edgeworth: This photo was taken yesterday. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: If Judge Gravelle had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken! Lang: Owwoooooooh! Lang: Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not? Kay: I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent! Lang: Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning? Lang: ........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: \"The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years.\" My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed. Edgeworth: I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death. Kay: Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head! Edgeworth: The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Bigg Building. Lang: Lang: So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either. Edgeworth: However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that... Lang: Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately, there is no need for a search. Lang: What'd you say!? Edgeworth: This piece of evidence proves that Judge Gravelle could not have hidden the body! Present Combination Lock Edgeworth: Leads to: \"All the entrances to the film lot were locked.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. That's the evidence you were talking about? Edgeworth: Indeed. If you look at this piece of evidence, you'll see that Judge Gravelle could not have... Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor, you'd better get that thing out of my face. Arguing about pointless objects is a waste of my time! Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (So this wasn't it!) Kay: Mr. Lang says that Ms. Gravelle moved the body, but... ...wouldn't it be impossible for Ms. Gravelle to enter the film lot in the first place? Edgeworth: (Whether Judge Gravelle could have entered the crime scene or not... Don't I have a piece of evidence which proves that?) Lang: It was that woman who moved the body. Ready to admit defeat, Mr. Prosecutor? Edgeworth: No, Agent Lang. That is impossible. Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence proves that Judge Gravelle could not have hidden the body!\" Edgeworth: All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut last night. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: Therefore, Judge Gravelle could not have entered the film lot two nights ago! Lang: Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago! Edgeworth: ...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago? Lang: Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage. -- Why Gravelle? Pt. 2 -- Lang: A photo was recorded 10\u201320 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: The president never came down from the rooftop? Lang: That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from! Edgeworth: (A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Gravelle...) Security Camera Photo data updated in my Organizer. Kay: A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat! Edgeworth: So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky. Kay: That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off. Edgeworth: (Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"10-20 minutes\"... That's rather vague. Lang: The problem here isn't when it happened. At least, not right now. What's important is what that woman did after that. Edgeworth: ...What Judge Gravelle did? Could you tell me about it in more detail? Lang: Hmph. That's what I was going to do. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you certain she was alone in the elevator? Lang: Yeah, I'm sure. It'd been 10-20 minutes after they went up to the roof... The security camera by the elevator only recorded that woman. She was definitely alone. I saw it with my own two eyes! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Judge Gravelle returned alone on the elevator. This point seems to be accurate.) Kay: Hmm, that's strange. Isn't Ms. Gravelle always together with the Goddess of Law? Edgeworth: In this case, we aren't counting ethereal beings. Kay: Aww. Poor Goddess of Law. We should give her an offering to lift her spirits! Edgeworth: ...Returning to the topic at hand... Agent Lang, could the president have used the elevator after Judge Gravelle? Lang: Yeah. I thought of that too. However... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just to be sure... the camera didn't have any blind spots or malfunctions, right? Lang: You think I'd make a mistake like that? Are you mocking my investigation? Edgeworth: No. It is simply my nature to question everything. Lang: Tch! At any rate, this footage can be trusted. I'm sure of that. The persistent took the elevator on the way up with that woman, but he never came back down! Edgeworth: Understood. While I reserve judgment on your logic, I shall trust in your investigation. Lang: Oh, is that how it is? Do what you want. ...It won't change a thing. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And if there were, in fact, some other way besides the elevator...? Lang: Lang: From the roof of a 50-story building? Hah! That's ridiculous. Without the elevator, there's no way to go down, let alone get off the viewing platform. You'll need something better than that to break my logic! Edgeworth: (A way to get off the rooftop viewing platform, without using the elevator...) Lang: How about it, Mr. Prosecutor? Do you understand now? There is no reason for the president to be lying sprawled out on the pavement here... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang. It's still too early to make that conclusion. Lang: Hmph. No matter how much you struggle, there's no escape from my fangs. Edgeworth: I wonder about that. Perhaps there is a hidden route... ...that allows us to escape from the locked room and your fangs simultaneously. Kay: Whoa! The proclamation of a miraculous escape! Even a Great Thief's gotta pay attention! Lang: Now you've said it, Mr. Prosecutor. If that's what you think, then show me... ...that \"hidden route\" of yours! Edgeworth: (A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: A self-styled Great Thief and so-called \"second Yatagarasu\" who's always looking to bag the greatest treasure of all -- the truth.\nCharacter 1\nName: Lotta Hart\nDescription: A freelance photojournalist who I've met in the past.

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response_json": {
      "evidence": 2,
      "testimony": 3
    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. The testimonies are from Lang, and they all revolve around the idea that the president couldn't have left the rooftop except by being pushed off by Judge Gav\u00e8lle because there's no other way down except the elevator. \n\nLooking at the evidence list, Evidence 10 is the Security Camera Footage, which shows the president and Judge Gav\u00e8lle arriving on the roof but no footage of him leaving. Lang's testimony 3 says there's no other way down except the elevator. However, there's another evidence: Evidence 2 is the Bigg Building, which mentions a hidden 51st floor entrance on the roof. If there's a secret entrance, maybe the president could have used that instead of the elevator.\n\nWait, but how does that connect? The Bigg Building's hidden entrance could be a way to exit without using the elevator. If the president went through the hidden entrance to the 51st floor, he wouldn't need to take the elevator down. That would mean there's another way, contradicting Lang's testimony 3 that there's no other way down. \n\nBut wait, the testimony in question is Testimony 3: \"There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?\" If the Bigg Building's evidence shows a hidden entrance (the 51st floor), that would provide an alternative route, thus contradicting the testimony. Therefore, Evidence 2 (Bigg Building) contradicts Testimony 3."

The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means \"7 Branched Sword\". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare... February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Hey, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah? What is it? Maya: You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you? Phoenix: Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all. Maya: But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right? Phoenix: Um... I guess so, yeah. Maya: Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up! Phoenix: (Pearls...?) Pearl: So! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick! Phoenix: ...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face? Pearl: It's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special! Phoenix: ...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.) Maya: \"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true! Phoenix: I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me. Maya: It's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training! Phoenix: (Now I definitely don't want to go...) Maya: You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there! Phoenix: Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious? Pearl: Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us! Maya: Yeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"! Phoenix: Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway. Maya: Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff! Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"? Pearl: No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall! Phoenix: ... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places. Maya: Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!? Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!? Phoenix: Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!? Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun... Maya: Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick? Phoenix: (Th-This girl... I-It's...!) Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence. Dahlia: Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me! Phoenix: But... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...) Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... I'll go. Maya: Huh...? Phoenix: Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go. Maya: Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!? Pearl: Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!? \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls. Phoenix: (Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.) February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Brrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick! Phoenix: Maybe you should put on something warmer for a change! Maya: W-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...) Pearl: Wow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple! Maya: P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo! ???: Well, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple! Maya: Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo! ???: Oh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold. Phoenix: What's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--! ???: Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside. Maya: Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass-- ???: Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. Bikini: I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini. Maya: B-B-B-Bikini...!? Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! Maya: It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Pearl: R-Reckless...? Maya: \"Wa ha ha\"...? Pearl: Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day. Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir\u00e9e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! \u266aIris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!\u266a Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask\u2606DeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record. Ami Fey statue (subsequent times) Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir.

Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim.

That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge.

(Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning. (Changed from [I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...

However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.Edgeworth: ...Indeed.Judge: I'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin.

Prosecuting prodigy.Judge: V-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?von Karma: ... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.Judge: Y-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh!

Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!von Karma: ...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.Bikini: Little old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.Judge: ... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!von Karma: ...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!Judge: Y-You want me to leave!?Bikini: No need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!Edgeworth: In any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.Bikini: That's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...Judge: Let us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak. It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Judge: Hmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?Bikini: ...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.Edgeworth: (That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)von Karma: There is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?Edgeworth: ...Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple...? Bikini: Well, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right? Judge: We'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam. Bikini: ...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training. Edgeworth: And how exactly do you help with this process...? Bikini: It is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising. von Karma: Like a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies. Edgeworth: (A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place?Bikini: Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Violently...? Bikini: That's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...? Bikini: That's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off!Bikini: So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You \"left Iris to help\"... With what? Bikini: What do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper. Judge: Wasn't it your place to remain with the disciple? Bikini: Well, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away. Edgeworth: Just to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct? Bikini: Yes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions.Present Iris's Testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all. Bikini: Well, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: In that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all! Bikini: N... No...! She said that...? von Karma: von Karma: A defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi. von Karma: ...! Bikini: But that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...! Judge: Hmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah! von Karma: ...All people lie. That is my belief. Judge: Why am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question... Bikini: Dear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you? Judge: A-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I... Bikini: My memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter! Judge: Then... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence. Edgeworth: ...Understood, Your Honor. (I was na\u00efve to think that alone would do the trick.) Judge: Then please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination. Changes statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\"Bikini: Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure that you're not making a mistake...? Bikini: ...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor! Edgeworth: Nngh...! Bikini: Iris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake! Judge: ...An excellent finish there, witness. Edgeworth: (Still, I have to wonder...)Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\"Bikini: There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath? Bikini: My back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all. Edgeworth: How long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking? Bikini: ... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind! Edgeworth: ...? Bikini: I bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones... Edgeworth: W-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah! von Karma: ...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth. Judge: The lowest of the low. Edgeworth: (Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?) Bikini: Anyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so...Bikini: It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The crime took place in the courtyard, correct...? Bikini: When you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard. von Karma: That's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case! Judge: Hmm... That certainly seems to be true.Edgeworth: (There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

    "cot": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking which evidence and testimony from the given materials contradict each other. \n\nFirst, I need to review the testimonies and the evidence provided. The testimony in question is from Bikini, specifically testimony 3: \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\" The evidence list includes Iris's Hood (Evidence 6), which is a hood that Iris always wears. \n\nBikini claims that Iris was dressed exactly as she was at dinner, which would include wearing her hood. However, the evidence shows that Iris gave her hood to Phoenix before the lights out bell, meaning she wouldn't have been wearing it when she supposedly came to the Inner Temple. This contradiction suggests that Bikini's testimony about Iris's attire is incorrect, indicating she might be lying or mistaken.\n\nSo, the contradiction is between Bikini's statement about Iris's clothing (testimony 3) and the existence of Iris's Hood (evidence 6) which was not on her during the time in question."

You are a spirit medium, after all. Maya: But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right? Phoenix: Um... I guess so, yeah. Maya: Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up! Phoenix: (Pearls...?) Pearl: So! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick! Phoenix: ...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face? Pearl: It's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special! Phoenix: ...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.) Maya: \"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true! Phoenix: I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me. Maya: It's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training! Phoenix: (Now I definitely don't want to go...) Maya: You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there! Phoenix: Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious? Pearl: Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us! Maya: Yeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"! Phoenix: Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway. Maya: Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff! Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"? Pearl: No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall! Phoenix: ... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places. Maya: Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!? Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!? Phoenix: Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!? Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun... Maya: Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick? Phoenix: (Th-This girl... I-It's...!) Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say...

Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it.

Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir\u00e9e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! \u266aIris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!\u266a Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask\u2606DeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record. Ami Fey statue (subsequent times) Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that.

That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning. (Changed from [I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Edgeworth: (Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!)\n-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple...? Bikini: Well, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right? Judge: We'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam. Bikini: ...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training. Edgeworth: And how exactly do you help with this process...? Bikini: It is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising. von Karma: Like a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies. Edgeworth: (A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place?Bikini: Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Violently...? Bikini: That's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...? Bikini: That's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off!Bikini: So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You \"left Iris to help\"... With what? Bikini: What do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper. Judge: Wasn't it your place to remain with the disciple? Bikini: Well, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away. Edgeworth: Just to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct? Bikini: Yes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions.Present Iris's Testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all. Bikini: Well, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: In that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all! Bikini: N... No...! She said that...? von Karma: von Karma: A defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi. von Karma: ...! Bikini: But that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...! Judge: Hmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah! von Karma: ...All people lie. That is my belief. Judge: Why am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question... Bikini: Dear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you? Judge: A-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I... Bikini: My memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter! Judge: Then... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence. Edgeworth: ...Understood, Your Honor. (I was na\u00efve to think that alone would do the trick.) Judge: Then please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination. Changes statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\"Bikini: Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure that you're not making a mistake...? Bikini: ...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor! Edgeworth: Nngh...! Bikini: Iris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake! Judge: ...An excellent finish there, witness. Edgeworth: (Still, I have to wonder...)Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\"Bikini: There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath? Bikini: My back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all. Edgeworth: How long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking? Bikini: ... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind! Edgeworth: ...? Bikini: I bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones... Edgeworth: W-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah! von Karma: ...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth. Judge: The lowest of the low. Edgeworth: (Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?) Bikini: Anyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so...Bikini: It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The crime took place in the courtyard, correct...? Bikini: When you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard. von Karma: That's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case! Judge: Hmm... That certainly seems to be true.Edgeworth: (There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)Edgeworth: ...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct?Bikini: Of course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...von Karma:von Karma: H-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?Edgeworth: That's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.von Karma: W... What!?Edgeworth: ...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)Bikini: Well well well!Edgeworth: (It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)Judge: Order! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!von Karma: ...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?Bikini: Spares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.Judge: I see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?Bikini: Each nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...Judge: Hmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!von Karma: If there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!Judge: Hmm...Edgeworth: (I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)Judge: ...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.Bikini: I-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...von Karma: Sister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!Edgeworth: (Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)Witness Testimony-- After My Bath --Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple. And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and... Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things! Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard. The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Judge: You saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.Edgeworth: (This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)von Karma: I would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth: Calling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- After My Bath --Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple? Bikini: Let me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge. von Karma: Still, you never made it back there that night, did you? Bikini: T-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall...Bikini: And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you heard a noise...? Bikini: \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: ...That could only be the sound of the victim falling. Bikini: It's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that. Judge: But then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground? Bikini: ... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha... Judge: Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah! von Karma: The next one to laugh gets a whipping! Bikini: Well. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and...Bikini: Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims. Bikini: Hey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to... Edgeworth: The murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can! Bikini: Hmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time! Edgeworth: ...Please, don't keep us in suspense. Bikini: Her hood! von Karma: Her hood...? Bikini: That's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right? Edgeworth: ...Urk! von Karma: Hah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: What do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important? It's not important Edgeworth: (...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them. Judge: Hmm... Judge: Very well. ...Please, continue with your testimony. von Karma: Hmph... Leads back to cross-examination It's important Edgeworth: (This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony. von Karma: Heh... Miles Edgeworth. von Karma: If you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip! Judge: Witness. Add that statement to your testimony. Bikini: ...No problem. Adds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\"Bikini: Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You are sure about that...? Bikini: Yes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it! Edgeworth: ...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself. Bikini: Anyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out. von Karma: Like me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip. Edgeworth: (At least then it might bite you and not someone else...) Bikini: Iris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it! Judge: ...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh.Bikini: Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct? Judge: Which means... the victim's room was on the second floor? Bikini: No, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building. Judge: I see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct? Bikini: Yes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all...Bikini: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What makes you so sure of all this...? Bikini: It's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: You're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height. Judge: Hmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then. Bikini: Yep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (There's only two of them working there...!) von Karma: What's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark? Edgeworth: ...Present Elise's Autopsy Report Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\"Edgeworth: (...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now...

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which evidence contradicts which testimony in the given case. The user provided a lot of information, so I'll need to go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies by Bikini. One of them is \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" That's testimony 3. She's saying that when she saw Iris committing the crime, Iris wasn't wearing her hood.\n\nNow, checking the evidences. There's Iris's Hood (Evidence 6), which was given to Phoenix Wright before the lights out bell. The description says that Iris gave him the hood before the bell rang at 10 PM. So if Iris wasn't wearing her hood during the murder (around 11 PM), that aligns with this evidence. Wait, but Bikini's testimony claims that Iris wasn't wearing the hood, which matches the evidence. Hmm, maybe not a contradiction here.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the key point here is that Bikini claims Iris was at the Inner Temple earlier, which would require her to have the hood. But according to the evidence, Iris had already given her hood to Phoenix, so she couldn't have been wearing it. Wait, the timeline is important. The hood was given to Phoenix before 10 PM when the bell was rung. Bikini claims she saw Iris at the Inner Temple after 10 PM, but Iris couldn't have been wearing the hood then. Therefore, Bikini's statement that Iris was at the Inner Temple (and thus wearing the hood) contradicts the evidence that she had already given it away. But in her testimony about the murder, Bikini says Iris wasn't wearing the hood, which actually supports the evidence. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here.\n\nWait, the testimony in question is during the cross-examination where Bikini adds that Iris wasn't wearing the hood during the murder. But if Iris had given the hood to Phoenix before the murder, then that would align. However, Bikini also earlier testified that she saw Iris at the Inner Temple after 10 PM, which would mean that Iris was there without the hood. But if Iris had already given the hood away, that's possible. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nLooking back, the initial testimony by Bikini was that Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed as usual. Then, when Edgeworth presents the hood, it's shown that Iris couldn't have been wearing it. So the contradiction here is between Bikini's initial statement that Iris was at the Inner Temple (implying she was in her usual attire, including the hood) and the fact that the hood was given away before that. So in the first part of her testimony where she says Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed as at dinner, that would include the hood. But the evidence (Iris's Hood) shows that she wasn't wearing it because she gave it to Phoenix. Therefore, the contradiction is between the hood evidence and the testimony that Iris was at the Inner Temple with her usual attire.\n\nWait, but the specific testimony that's being cross-examined here is the one where Bikini says \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\" That would include the hood. However, the evidence (Iris's Hood, Evidence 6) shows that Iris had already given the hood to Phoenix before the time she was supposed to be at the Inner Temple. Therefore, Bikini's statement that Iris was dressed as at dinner (including the hood) is contradicted by the evidence that she wasn't wearing it anymore.\n\nSo the correct contradiction would be Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) against Testimony 1 (where Bikini says Iris was dressed as at dinner, implying she had the hood on). Wait, looking back at the testimonies provided:\n\nTestimony 0: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nTestimony 1: And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nTestimony 2: Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nTestimony 3: Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\nTestimony 4: Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nTestimony 5: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.\n\nWait, the initial testimony where Bikini says Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed as at dinner is part of the earlier testimony, not listed here. But in the cross-examination section provided, during the \"Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --\", the testimony is adjusted to include that Iris was dressed as at dinner, which includes the hood. Then, Edgeworth presents the Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) to contradict that, leading the court to adjust the testimony. Then in the later testimony \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" (Testimony 3), which actually aligns with the evidence. But the initial contradiction is when Bikini claims Iris was at the Inner Temple with her usual attire (including hood), which is contradicted by the fact that she had given the hood away. Therefore, the correct contradiction would be Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) against the earlier testimony (not listed here), but looking at the provided testimonies in the cross-examination section, the key contradiction is when Bikini adds that Iris wasn't wearing the hood. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, in the testimony \"Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\" (Testimony 4). The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the victim fell 10 feet. But the victim's room was on an elevated part, which is 10 feet, so that matches. Maybe not.\n\nAnother possibility: The murder weapon. Bikini testifies that the Shichishito (Evidence 10) was used, but the actual murder weapon was the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9). So presenting Evidence 9 (Victim's Staff) against Testimony 2 or 5 where she mentions the sword. But in the testimony, she says \"with that sword\", which is the Shichishito. But the real murder weapon is the staff's hidden sword, so there's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the Shichishito is the sword on the statue, but the actual murder weapon was the dagger (Evidence 19) or the staff's hidden sword. Wait, according to the evidence descriptions, the Shichishito (10) has the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but the staff (9) has a hidden sword. The autopsy report says cause of death was a stab in the back. So if the Shichishito was the murder weapon, but the staff's hidden sword is the real one, that could be a contradiction. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the problem here is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a specific set of testimonies and evidences.\n\nLooking back, during the cross-examination of Bikini's testimony, Edgeworth presents the Iris's Hood (6) to show that she couldn't have been wearing it when Bikini claims to have seen her at the Inner Temple. That's a key contradiction. So in the initial testimony where Bikini says Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed as at dinner (with the hood), but the hood was already given away, making that impossible. However, in the cross-examination section provided, the testimony adjusted is \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\" So when Edgeworth presents the hood (evidence 6), that contradicts the testimony that she was dressed as at dinner (including the hood), since the hood was given away. Therefore, the correct pair would be evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) against testimony 0 or the adjusted testimony. But according to the given testimonies in the problem, the testimony in question is testimony 3: \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" Which would actually align with the evidence. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between the weather data (evidence 7) and the testimony about the lightning strike. The weather data says lightning struck at 10:45 PM, but the testimony about the time of the murder being around 11 PM. If the bridge was burning due to lightning, and the murder happened after, maybe the timeline is off. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the staff (evidence 9) has a hidden sword, which is the real murder weapon, but Bikini testifies that the Shichishito (evidence 10) was used. So presenting evidence 9 against testimony 2 (\"with that sword, of all things!\") would show that the real weapon was the staff's sword. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, the victim's staff (9) has a crystal sphere, but in the evidence description, it's mentioned that the crystal sphere (16) was found near Dusky Bridge. So if the staff should have the sphere but it's missing, that could indicate something. But how does that relate to the testimony?\n\nHmm. This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to recap.\n\nThe key contradiction presented in the transcript is when Edgeworth uses the Iris's Hood (6) to show that Bikini couldn't have seen Iris at the Inner Temple with her hood on, as Iris had already given it to Phoenix. This leads Bikini to adjust her testimony, saying that Iris wasn't wearing the hood during the murder. But the initial claim that Iris was at the Inner Temple (with hood) is contradicted by the hood being given away. However, in the provided testimonies, the adjusted testimony (testimony 3) states that Iris wasn't wearing the hood, which aligns with the evidence. So where is the contradiction?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial contradiction is when Bikini testifies that she saw Iris at the Inner Temple (before the murder) dressed as usual (including the hood), but the evidence shows the hood was given to Phoenix before that. Therefore, the contradiction is between the initial testimony (not the adjusted one) and the hood evidence. However, in the given testimonies, the specific testimony to focus on is the one that is contradicted by an evidence.\n\nLooking at the JSON data provided, the user lists the testimonies, and the one in question is testimony 3: \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" This is part of the adjusted testimony after Edgeworth presents the hood. But the key contradiction was when Bikini initially said Iris was at the Inner Temple with her hood, which was impossible. However, in the cross-examination flow, after presenting the hood, Bikini adjusts her testimony to say Iris wasn't wearing it. Therefore, the actual contradiction is between the initial statement (Iris was at the Inner Temple with hood) and the evidence (Iris's Hood), which is not listed in the testimonies provided here. \n\nBut according to the problem, the user has provided a set of testimonies and evidences. The testimonies in the problem include \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\" (testimony 3). But if that's the case, then how does this testimony contradict any evidence? Because if she's saying Iris wasn't wearing the hood, which aligns with the fact that she gave it to Phoenix, then there's no contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me look again. \n\nAnother possibility: The testimony says that Bikini saw Iris stab Elise with the Shichishito (evidence 10), but the actual murder weapon was the staff's hidden sword (evidence 9). So if Edgeworth presents evidence 9 (staff with hidden sword) against testimony 2 (\"with that sword, of all things!\"), that would show the real weapon was different. But the staff's sword is the murder weapon, so Bikini's testimony about the Shichishito being used is false. \n\nAlternatively, the Shichishito (evidence 10) is described as \"the apparent murder weapon\" but \"not the murder weapon\", which would contradict Bikini's testimony that it was used. \n\nWait, looking at the evidence descriptions:\n\nEvidence 10: Shichishito. The apparent murder weapon. A seven-branched, jagged sword. Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it. Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon.\n\nSo the Shichishito is not the actual murder weapon. But Bikini's testimony says that Iris used the Shichishito. Therefore, the contradiction is between testimony 2 (\"with that sword, of all things!\") and evidence 10 (Shichishito is not the murder weapon). But the evidence says that the Shichishito has the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints but is not the murder weapon. How is that possible? Maybe the real murder weapon is the staff's hidden sword (evidence 9), which is the actual cause of death.\n\nWait, the staff's description (evidence 9) says \"Has a sword hidden inside. The actual weapon used to murder the victim.\" So the real murder weapon is the staff's sword, not the Shichishito. Therefore, when Bikini testifies that Iris used the Shichishito (testimony 2), but the real weapon is the staff's sword (evidence 9), there's a contradiction. So presenting evidence 9 against testimony 2 would show that Bikini is mistaken about the weapon used.\n\nBut according to the problem, which pair should be chosen? Let me check the evidence numbers. Evidence 9 is the Victim's Staff, and testimony 2 is \"Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\".\n\nSo the correct answer would be evidence 9 (Victim's Staff) contradicts testimony 2 (using the Shichishito). But the evidence description for 9 says it's the actual weapon. Therefore, presenting evidence 9 against testimony 2 would show that Bikini's testimony about the Shichishito being used is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the Shichishito (evidence 10) is not the murder weapon, so Bikini's testimony about seeing Iris use it (testimony 2) is contradicted by evidence 10's description. But the evidence 10's description says \"not the murder weapon\" even though it has the victim's blood. That seems contradictory. \n\nAlternatively, the autopsy report (evidence 11) says the cause was a stab in the back, which could be from the staff's sword, not the Shichishito. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the key point is that Bikini's testimony about the sword used (Shichishito) is contradicted by evidence showing the real weapon was the staff's hidden sword. Therefore, evidence 9 (staff) contradicts testimony 2 (using Shichishito). So the answer should be {\"evidence\": 9, \"testimony\": 2}.\n\nAlternatively, the staff (evidence 9) has the hidden sword, and the Shichishito (evidence 10) is not the real weapon, so the contradiction is between testimony 2 and evidence 10's description. But evidence 10's description states that it's not the murder weapon despite having blood and fingerprints. So presenting evidence 10 to contradict testimony 2 would show that, but the evidence's own description is conflicting. \n\nThis is tricky. Based on the game's actual plot, the murder weapon was the staff's hidden sword, not the Shichishito. Bikini saw Iris (actually Dahlia channeled by Elise) using the Shichishito, but the real murder weapon was the staff's sword. However, in the game, Edgeworth uses the staff to show that the actual weapon was different. Therefore, the correct contradiction is between the Victim's Staff (9) and testimony 2.\n\nSo, the answer should be {\"evidence\": 9, \"testimony\": 2}."

We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!

Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir\u00e9e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! \u266aIris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!\u266a Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask\u2606DeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record.

Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim.

Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here.

(Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning. (Changed from [I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Edgeworth: (Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!)\n-- After My Bath --Bikini: I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple? Bikini: Let me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge. von Karma: Still, you never made it back there that night, did you? Bikini: T-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall...Bikini: And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you heard a noise...? Bikini: \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: ...That could only be the sound of the victim falling. Bikini: It's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that. Judge: But then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground? Bikini: ... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha... Judge: Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah! von Karma: The next one to laugh gets a whipping! Bikini: Well. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and...Bikini: Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims. Bikini: Hey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to... Edgeworth: The murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can! Bikini: Hmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time! Edgeworth: ...Please, don't keep us in suspense. Bikini: Her hood! von Karma: Her hood...? Bikini: That's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right? Edgeworth: ...Urk! von Karma: Hah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth! Judge: What do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important? It's not important Edgeworth: (...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them. Judge: Hmm... Judge: Very well. ...Please, continue with your testimony. von Karma: Hmph... Leads back to cross-examination It's important Edgeworth: (This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony. von Karma: Heh... Miles Edgeworth. von Karma: If you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip! Judge: Witness. Add that statement to your testimony. Bikini: ...No problem. Adds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\"Bikini: Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You are sure about that...? Bikini: Yes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it! Edgeworth: ...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself. Bikini: Anyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out. von Karma: Like me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip. Edgeworth: (At least then it might bite you and not someone else...) Bikini: Iris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it! Judge: ...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh.Bikini: Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct? Judge: Which means... the victim's room was on the second floor? Bikini: No, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building. Judge: I see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct? Bikini: Yes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all...Bikini: The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What makes you so sure of all this...? Bikini: It's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that. von Karma: You're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height. Judge: Hmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then. Bikini: Yep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (There's only two of them working there...!) von Karma: What's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark? Edgeworth: ...Present Elise's Autopsy Report Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\"Edgeworth: (...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)Edgeworth: ...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.Bikini: Oh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!Edgeworth: However... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?von Karma: T-The autopsy report...?Edgeworth: The victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed.von Karma: Ah...!Judge: T-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here!Edgeworth: The scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?von Karma: Aaah!Judge: O-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree?von Karma: Th-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Were there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?von Karma: ...!Edgeworth: She was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?Judge: W-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!von Karma: ...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.Judge: ...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!von Karma: I'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.Judge: When it produces the most blood...?von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.Edgeworth: Indeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound.Judge: That's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!von Karma: We have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!Judge: Order! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!Edgeworth: (I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)von Karma: ...Hmph...Judge: It seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!Bikini: Don't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!von Karma: Sister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.Edgeworth: (...With the whip?)Bikini: ...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...Witness Testimony-- Further Details --Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise. I've never seen so much blood before... That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you? And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Judge: Hmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...von Karma: Von Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth: (\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Further Details --Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time... was the victim bleeding? Bikini: Well... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then. von Karma: ...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound. Edgeworth: In any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!?Bikini: Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Think carefully. This is very important. Bikini: It's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.) von Karma: The victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth.Bikini: I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out? Bikini: That's right... Bikini: The whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah... Judge: It goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding. von Karma: ...Nothing out of place here. Edgeworth: (Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.)Present Shichishito Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\"Bikini: I've never seen so much blood before...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood? Bikini: T-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too... von Karma: When the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner. Edgeworth: Wh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?) Judge: Hmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me... Edgeworth: (What should I do...? Press this point further?) Stop here Edgeworth: (I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding! Leads back to cross-examination Press further Edgeworth: Going back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...? Bikini: Well, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw. Judge: W-What did you see? Bikini: Maybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day. Edgeworth: Pulling the sword out...? Bikini: Well, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\". Judge: Witness! You will add this statement to your testimony! Bikini: Oh... Was that important...!? Edgeworth: (More important than you can imagine...) Adds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\"Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...? Bikini: No mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day! Edgeworth: ...Don't you think that's a bit odd? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Why would the killer pull out the sword? von Karma: What...? Edgeworth: If all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Indeed... It is strange, now that you mention it. Edgeworth: (I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...) von Karma: A-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness?Bikini: That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Now, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct? Bikini: Well... I was unconscious... von Karma: How long were you out for? Bikini: I don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually. Judge: Hmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation! Bikini: Well, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you. Edgeworth: ...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...?Bikini: And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct? Bikini: Just stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough. Bikini: But to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...! von Karma: Truly, a heinous, despicable crime. Edgeworth: It is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily... von Karma: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem? Edgeworth: Exactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that? von Karma: ...! Judge: Hmmmmm... No, I don't think I can. von Karma: ... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts! Bikini: That's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself... Edgeworth: (\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.)Edgeworth: (There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I'm looking at the testimonies by Bikini and the evidence provided.\n\nTestimony 3 says, \"I've never seen so much blood before...\" which implies there was a lot of blood when Bikini saw the scene. However, the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is described as having the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints, but it's noted that it's not the actual murder weapon. Wait, the Shichishito's description says it's the apparent murder weapon but later mentions it's not the actual one. Hmm.\n\nWait, the Shichishito's description says: \"Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon.\" So if the Shichishito wasn't the murder weapon, then the actual blood would come from another weapon. But Bikini's testimony mentions seeing a lot of blood from the sword being pulled out, which was the Shichishito. If the Shichishito wasn't the real murder weapon, then the blood on it might not have been from the stabbing, contradicting Bikini's testimony about the blood.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Victim's Staff (Evidence 9) which has a sword hidden inside and is the actual murder weapon. If the real weapon was the staff's hidden sword, then the Shichishito wasn't used to kill, meaning the blood on it is not from the stabbing. Bikini's testimony about seeing a lot of blood from the Shichishito being pulled out would be a contradiction because the real murder weapon (the staff's sword) would have caused the bleeding, not the Shichishito.\n\nSo, Bikini's testimony about the blood (Testimony 3) would conflict with the evidence that the Shichishito isn't the real murder weapon (Evidence 10). Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 10."

Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point.

February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Hey, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah? What is it? Maya: You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you? Phoenix: Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all. Maya: But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right? Phoenix: Um... I guess so, yeah. Maya: Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up! Phoenix: (Pearls...?) Pearl: So! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick! Phoenix: ...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face? Pearl: It's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special! Phoenix: ...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.) Maya: \"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true! Phoenix: I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me. Maya: It's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training! Phoenix: (Now I definitely don't want to go...) Maya: You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there! Phoenix: Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious? Pearl: Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us! Maya: Yeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"! Phoenix: Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway. Maya: Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff! Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"? Pearl: No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall! Phoenix: ... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places. Maya: Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!? Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!? Phoenix: Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!? Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun... Maya: Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick? Phoenix: (Th-This girl... I-It's...!) Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence. Dahlia: Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me! Phoenix: But... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...) Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... I'll go. Maya: Huh...? Phoenix: Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go. Maya: Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!? Pearl: Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!? \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.

February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Brrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick! Phoenix: Maybe you should put on something warmer for a change! Maya: W-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...) Pearl: Wow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple! Maya: P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo! ???: Well, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple! Maya: Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo! ???: Oh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold. Phoenix: What's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--! ???: Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside. Maya: Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass-- ???: Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. Bikini: I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini. Maya: B-B-B-Bikini...!? Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! Maya: It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Pearl: R-Reckless...? Maya: \"Wa ha ha\"...? Pearl: Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day. Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir\u00e9e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! \u266aIris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!\u266a Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask\u2606DeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record. Ami Fey statue (subsequent times) Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir.

Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim.

Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry...

Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Edgeworth: (Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!)\n-- Further Details --Bikini: When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time... was the victim bleeding? Bikini: Well... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then. von Karma: ...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound. Edgeworth: In any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!?Bikini: Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Think carefully. This is very important. Bikini: It's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Edgeworth: (It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.) von Karma: The victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth.Bikini: I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out? Bikini: That's right... Bikini: The whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah... Judge: It goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding. von Karma: ...Nothing out of place here. Edgeworth: (Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.)Present Shichishito Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\"Bikini: I've never seen so much blood before...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood? Bikini: T-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too... von Karma: When the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner. Edgeworth: Wh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?) Judge: Hmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me... Edgeworth: (What should I do...? Press this point further?) Stop here Edgeworth: (I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding! Leads back to cross-examination Press further Edgeworth: Going back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...? Bikini: Well, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw. Judge: W-What did you see? Bikini: Maybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day. Edgeworth: Pulling the sword out...? Bikini: Well, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\". Judge: Witness! You will add this statement to your testimony! Bikini: Oh... Was that important...!? Edgeworth: (More important than you can imagine...) Adds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\"Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...? Bikini: No mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day! Edgeworth: ...Don't you think that's a bit odd? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Why would the killer pull out the sword? von Karma: What...? Edgeworth: If all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: T-That's... Judge: Indeed... It is strange, now that you mention it. Edgeworth: (I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...) von Karma: A-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness?Bikini: That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Now, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct? Bikini: Well... I was unconscious... von Karma: How long were you out for? Bikini: I don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually. Judge: Hmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation! Bikini: Well, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you. Edgeworth: ...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...?Bikini: And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct? Bikini: Just stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough. Bikini: But to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...! von Karma: Truly, a heinous, despicable crime. Edgeworth: It is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily... von Karma: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem? Edgeworth: Exactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that? von Karma: ...! Judge: Hmmmmm... No, I don't think I can. von Karma: ... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts! Bikini: That's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself... Edgeworth: (\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.)Edgeworth: (There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)Edgeworth: Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.Bikini: W-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.von Karma: What contradictions are you talking about?Edgeworth: In the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!Judge: What do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!von Karma: Explain yourself!Edgeworth: To start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.von Karma:von Karma: \"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!Judge: The objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: ...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.von Karma: T-That's...Edgeworth: We also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!von Karma:von Karma: T-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction.Judge: Y-You've still got more!?Edgeworth: ...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it?von Karma: Ah...!Edgeworth: If this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword!von Karma: Noooooo!Judge: Order! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!von Karma: Bravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!Judge: But what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...Edgeworth: ...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.von Karma: And that is...?Edgeworth: The weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!Judge: W-Whaaaaaaaaat!?von Karma: A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.Edgeworth: Let's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?Bikini: W-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...Edgeworth: ...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon!Judge: Order! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!von Karma: So maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object.Judge: Hmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: ... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.Judge: The obvious... question?Edgeworth: ...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to?von Karma: ...!Edgeworth: It goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found.von Karma: T-That's...Judge: Answer the question, Ms. von Karma!von Karma: ... No evidence of that kind was found.Judge: Hmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!Bikini: Excuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...von Karma: ...What is it, Sister?Bikini: I was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...Judge: ... What exactly are you going on aboot here?Bikini: The murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!Edgeworth: You what!?von Karma: Well then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.Edgeworth: (Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?)Witness Testimony-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM... And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate. And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used! It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those! Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out? ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Judge: Hmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.Bikini: Well. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.von Karma: Quite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.Judge: A snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...von Karma: The tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!Tracks Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma: ...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!Edgeworth: (Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini: I saw the murder at around 11 PM...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...You are sure about the time? Bikini: Yes... I was worried about it, after all. Judge: Why was that? Bikini: Because I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: (Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.) von Karma: Please continue, Sister.Bikini: And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct? Bikini: Right, right, the one who trampled me. Edgeworth: (It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...) Bikini: There isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him? Edgeworth: He had forgotten it at home, apparently. von Karma: What a na\u00efve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too! Bikini: Anyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell.Bikini: And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited. Bikini: That's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls! Edgeworth: Now, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived? Bikini: Yes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate. von Karma: So... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time. Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?) Press further Edgeworth: (...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time? Bikini: Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean? Judge: What do you mean, eh? von Karma: What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used. Bikini: Ah! I see! I never thought of that! Judge: Hmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too! von Karma: ...Of course you did. Edgeworth: Then answer the question please, witness. Bikini: ... I don't often go around touching hot engines... Edgeworth: ...Hmm. Bikini: However... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it. Judge: Snow...? Bikini: Yes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow... Edgeworth: (There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!) Judge: It seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh! von Karma: How long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examination Stop here Edgeworth: (It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Judge: How long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile? Leads back to cross-examinationBikini: It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking. Bikini: Ah! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain? Judge: I think that's why the question was asked in the first place... Bikini: ...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch. Judge: Hmm... Crunch. Bikini: ...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then... Bikini: Anyway, the killer must have used it!Bikini: Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Refresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...? Bikini: Like I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes. von Karma: It's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile... Edgeworth: ...I have to concede that is more than enough time. von Karma: Is that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Bikini: ...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: While it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here. Judge: Oh? And what would this mystery element be? Edgeworth: The killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods? Judge: Hmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah! von Karma: Turning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor. Judge: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (She's as over the top as always...) von Karma: A-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth!Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Edgeworth: (Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...?

    "cot": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony in the given testimonies and evidences. The user provided a lot of information from the game transcript, characters, evidences, and testimonies.\n\nLooking at the testimonies by Bikini, one of them says, \"It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\" (Testimony 3). The evidence related to this would be the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) which shows snowmobile tracks leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. However, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) mentions that there was snow from 7 PM to around 10:50 PM and lightning at 10:45 PM. If the snowmobile was used after 10:45 PM, the tracks might have been covered by the ongoing snow, but the photo shows clear tracks. The snowmobile wasn't covered in snow when Bikini checked, implying recent use, but the snow was still falling until 10:50. So if the snowmobile was used after the snow stopped, the tracks would be visible. However, the lightning strike at 10:45 caused the bridge to burn, which might have taken time. The contradiction here is that if the snowmobile was used after the snow stopped (around 10:50), the tracks would be visible, but Bikini's testimony about the time it takes to get to the bridge via snowmobile (5 minutes) might conflict with the actual timing considering the snow and the fire. But maybe another angle: The Weather Data shows that the lightning struck at 10:45 PM, causing the bridge to burn. If the murder happened around 11 PM as per Bikini's testimony, using the snowmobile after the bridge was already on fire would be impossible. So the timing of the snowmobile tracks (Evidence 14) contradicts Bikini's claim that the defendant could have used the snowmobile after the murder (since the bridge was already burning by 10:45, making it impossible to cross after that). Therefore, the testimony about the time to use the snowmobile (Testimony 3) is contradicted by the Weather Data (Evidence 7) showing the bridge was already on fire when the snowmobile would have been used."

Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"? Pearl: No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall! Phoenix: ... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places. Maya: Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!? Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!? Phoenix: Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!? Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun... Maya: Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick? Phoenix: (Th-This girl... I-It's...!) Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence. Dahlia: Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me! Phoenix: But... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...) Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... I'll go. Maya: Huh...? Phoenix: Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go. Maya: Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!? Pearl: Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!? \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls. Phoenix: (Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.) February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Brrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick! Phoenix: Maybe you should put on something warmer for a change! Maya: W-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...) Pearl: Wow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple! Maya: P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo! ???: Well, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple! Maya: Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo! ???: Oh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold. Phoenix: What's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--! ???: Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside. Maya: Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass-- ???: Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. Bikini: I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini. Maya: B-B-B-Bikini...!? Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! Maya: It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Pearl: R-Reckless...? Maya: \"Wa ha ha\"...? Pearl: Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day. Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir\u00e9e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! \u266aIris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!\u266a Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask\u2606DeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record. Ami Fey statue (subsequent times) Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir.

Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim.

Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here.

(Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning. (Changed from [I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Edgeworth: (Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!)\n-- What I Saw --Butz: I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Judge: What ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: This one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: So, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way. Butz: OK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a \"lodge\", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right? Edgeworth: ... von Karma: See? You can do it if you try. Butz: Heh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: ...There is only one issue here. What you saw at Dusky Bridge.Butz: I walked to the bridge a number of times, but...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"A number of times\"...? How many? Butz: Maybe... five times? I went once every twenty minutes. Edgeworth: Which means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night? Butz: You bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands! Judge: Love, you say...? Edgeworth: It was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter. Judge: B-Blackmail...!? Butz: No, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh! von Karma: You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness! Judge: So... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh! Butz: Um... well... You see... Edgeworth: (Being called those names doesn't seem to bother him at all...)Butz: I didn't see a s-snowmobile!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Larry! You really didn't see it? Butz: H-H-Hey! No need to hit your desk! I can hear you! ...I didn't see it! I didn't see a s-s-snowmobile! Edgeworth: ... Larry. Say \"snowmobile\" for me, please? Butz: S-S-S-Snowmobile. Edgeworth: If you truly have nothing to hide... ...then why are you stammering like you just flew over a cuckoo's nest!? Butz: Sh-Shut up! W-W-What is this!? I don't know! Don't ask me! Edgeworth: (It seems that I'll need to start from a more obvious contradiction. I'm going to strike the blow that will finally get him to spill the beans!)Butz: I didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release)Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You didn't meet anyone? Butz: That's right. Because I've got nothing to do with this! And I'm just here to buy some viridian paint, OK!? Come on, I expect to see those crimson lake faces! Now! Judge: ... It would appear that simply pressing him isn't going to be enough, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed.Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry Butz...\"Edgeworth: (It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...)Edgeworth: Larry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble...Butz: I'm sorry...!Edgeworth: But... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction.Butz: Edgey! Are you... trying to console me?Judge: It certainly doesn't sound that way to me.Edgeworth: However... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create!Butz: Waaah... You're totally pinning this on me...Edgeworth: ...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz!Butz: ... That's right. Me, in the flesh.Judge: Hmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change!Butz: B-But...! What do you want me to do, then!?Edgeworth: Larry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release)Butz: ... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well...Judge: I'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder?Witness Testimony-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me! I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire! There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out. That's when I ran into Nick.Judge: Hmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you?von Karma: So... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire?Butz: It was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall.von Karma: W-What did you say!?Edgeworth: Oh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release)von Karma: ...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release)Judge: Now, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half? Butz: Well, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess. Judge: Hmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...? Butz: I set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too. Edgeworth: ...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end. von Karma: Because they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they? Butz: Shut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her.Butz: I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This \"light\" was, of course... Butz: Lightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah! von Karma: ...Or a little like that? Butz: Waaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda! Judge: Witness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge? Butz: Well, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so...Butz: I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Seeing that, what did you do? Butz: What do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart! von Karma: And that's why you went to take a look at the bridge? Butz: Well. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind. Judge: Hmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness.Butz: There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that? Butz: Hmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\" von Karma: How far is this small shack you were in from the bridge? Butz: Hold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk? Edgeworth: And how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there? Butz: Like I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare! Edgeworth: (...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?) Not right now. Edgeworth: (I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Why didn't you call anyone? Edgeworth: ...Larry. Let me ask you one thing. Butz: What is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face? Edgeworth: Why didn't you call anyone? Butz: Huh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Normally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct? Butz: ... Well, of course I thought of doing that. Judge: So then... let's hear why you didn't! Butz: H-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" Why did you go to the bridge? Edgeworth: So you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so? Butz: W-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there. Edgeworth: If that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning. Judge: In which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness! Butz: M-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\"Butz: That's when I ran into Nick.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did Phoenix Wright look when you met him? Butz: Hmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment. von Karma: How far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge? Butz: On his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say. Judge: ...And that's when the murder was reported? Butz: That's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge!Butz: I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright? Butz: Y-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway. Edgeworth: (What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!) von Karma: It was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct? Butz: Yeah. That's pretty much it. More or less.Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\"Butz: I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you decided to go and see what was happening? Butz: That's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special? Edgeworth: (Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce \"spectacle\"?) Judge: Life seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt... Butz: Well, my motto is to \"hit life back as hard as I can.\" A-Agah! von Karma: ...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip.Edgeworth: (...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit...

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given story. The user provided a lot of information, including characters, evidence, and testimonies. \n\nLooking at the testimonies from Larry Butz (Testimony 3: \"There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.\") and the evidence. The Weather Data (Evidence 7) states that lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM and that the snow stopped around 10:50 PM. Butz claims he went to check the bridge right after seeing the lightning, which would be around 10:45. However, he also mentions there was still some thunder when he went out. But according to the weather data, the lightning stopped by 11 PM, and the snow had already stopped by 10:50. If he went \"right away\" after the lightning, that would be around 10:45-10:50, but the thunder (lightning) was only until 11 PM. Wait, maybe the timing here is conflicting.\n\nWait, the Weather Data says lightning occurred from 10 PM to 11 PM. The specific strike on the bridge was at 10:45. But Butz says there was still thunder when he went to check, which would align with the time frame. Hmm. Maybe another angle. Let's look at Testimony 3 where he says there was still thunder when he went out. But according to the Weather Data, the lightning (and thunder) stopped around 11 PM. If he went immediately after the strike at 10:45, then the thunder would still be occurring until 11 PM. So that might not be a contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe another part. The Weather Data says around 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out. If the fire started at 10:45, then it would be out by 11:15. But Butz's testimony about arriving at the bridge and meeting Nick shortly after might conflict with the timeline. Alternatively, in Testimony 3, he says he went \"right away\" after the lightning, but the snow had stopped by 10:50. So when he went out, the snow had stopped. But if he went right after the lightning (10:45), the snow was still falling until 10:50. Wait, the Weather Data says snow was from 7 PM to approx. 10:50 PM. So if he went at 10:45, snow was still falling. But he mentions that when he went out, it had stopped snowing. Wait, in the cross-examination, Butz says, \"It had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind.\" So the snow had stopped when he went out. But according to the Weather Data, the snow stopped around 10:50. If the lightning strike was at 10:45, then when he went out after that, the snow was still falling until 10:50. Therefore, if Butz says it had stopped snowing when he went to check the bridge, but according to the data, the snow stopped around 10:50, which is after the lightning strike at 10:45. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. His testimony about the snow stopping when he went out contradicts the Weather Data, which says snow continued until 10:50. Therefore, if he went out at 10:45, the snow was still falling. But he claims it had stopped, which is impossible. Therefore, the evidence (Weather Data) contradicts Testimony 3 where he says there was still thunder but the snow had stopped. Wait, no. Let me check again. The cross-examination part:\n\nButz: \"It had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind.\"\n\nThe Weather Data says snow stopped around 10:50. The lightning strike was at 10:45. So if Butz went out right after the lightning (10:45), the snow was still falling until 10:50. Therefore, his statement that the snow had \"pretty much stopped\" when he went out contradicts the Weather Data which shows it was still snowing until 10:50. Therefore, using the Weather Data (evidence 7) to contradict Testimony 3 where he says he went out when there was still thunder (lightning) but the snow had stopped. The evidence shows that snow was ongoing until 10:50, so if he went out after 10:45 (the lightning strike), the snow was still happening. Therefore, his testimony about the snow having stopped when he went out is contradicted by the Weather Data."

February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Hey, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah? What is it? Maya: You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you? Phoenix: Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all. Maya: But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right? Phoenix: Um... I guess so, yeah. Maya: Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up! Phoenix: (Pearls...?) Pearl: So! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick! Phoenix: ...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face? Pearl: It's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special! Phoenix: ...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.) Maya: \"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true! Phoenix: I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me. Maya: It's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training! Phoenix: (Now I definitely don't want to go...) Maya: You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there! Phoenix: Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious? Pearl: Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us! Maya: Yeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"! Phoenix: Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway. Maya: Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff! Pearl: Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff! Phoenix: Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!? Maya: Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old. Phoenix: Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"? Pearl: No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall! Phoenix: ... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places. Maya: Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!? Pearl: Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!? Phoenix: Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!? Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun... Maya: Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick? Phoenix: (Th-This girl... I-It's...!) Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence. Dahlia: Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me! Phoenix: But... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...) Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ... I'll go. Maya: Huh...? Phoenix: Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go. Maya: Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?

February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Brrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick! Phoenix: Maybe you should put on something warmer for a change! Maya: W-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...) Pearl: Wow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple! Maya: P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo! ???: Well, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple! Maya: Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo! ???: Oh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold. Phoenix: What's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--! ???: Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside. Maya: Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass-- ???: Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. Bikini: I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini. Maya: B-B-B-Bikini...!? Bikini: That's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho! Maya: It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Pearl: R-Reckless...? Maya: \"Wa ha ha\"...? Pearl: Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day. Maya: But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m-- Bikini: Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around? Examine Gate Maya: What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh? Phoenix: It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya. Maya: Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings. Phoenix: Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down... Maya: Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time. Main Hall Maya: That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about! Phoenix: ...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die. Maya: I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle. Phoenix: Did you bring one for me? Maya: What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles? Phoenix: (Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...) Bell tower Maya: Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell! Phoenix: Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money? Maya: ...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick. Phoenix: Wh-What are you apologizing for? Snowmobile Maya: Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things! Phoenix: Most people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know. Maya: \"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desir\u00e9e. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\". Phoenix: Argh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"! Talk Channeling dojo Phoenix: Umm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway? Bikini: Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that? Maya: Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying. Bikini: Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power. Phoenix: H-Holy items...? Bikini: If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha. Phoenix: (Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...) Maya: Um, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...? Bikini: You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water. Maya: Eh...? Bikini: It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha! Maya: How am I supposed to \"be careful\"...? Pearl: Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this... The other nun Phoenix: Umm, Sister... About this picture... Bikini: Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think? Phoenix: Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way. Bikini: You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out. Maya: \"Iris\"...? Bikini: The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place. Maya: Really? That kinda sounds like fu-- Phoenix: Sorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now? Bikini: Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you? Pearl: ... *glare* Phoenix: No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all... Bikini: Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening. Maya: Inner Temple...? Bikini: Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha. Phoenix: (So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, do you think you could take a look at this? Bikini: I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say... Pearl: ...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think she's trying to say that she's busy. Maya: But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little. Pearl: Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!) February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo! Pearl: Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor! Phoenix: ...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here. Pearl: Well, kids are made of energy, you know! Phoenix: As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold. Maya: W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo! Phoenix: (Nngh... Is she going to make it...?) Examine Sliding doors Phoenix: I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls. Objects on floor Phoenix: There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death. Altar Phoenix: It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all. Magatama on altar Phoenix: There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood! Left corner near altar Phoenix: It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things. February 7Suspension Bridge Maya: Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us. Maya: Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: I-I'm just not very good with heights... Maya: Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights! Phoenix: ...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge. Maya: Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\". Phoenix: Read it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\". Maya: Well, it's practically the same thing. Examine Cliff on opposite side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. Maya: I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick? Phoenix: And do the Special Course? I think not. Maya: But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...) Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Maya: The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished. Phoenix: The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon. Maya: OK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then. Phoenix: ...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs. Maya: Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK? Phoenix: Graffiti is a crime, Maya. Bridge Maya: Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it. Maya: OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory. Phoenix: (That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.) Boulder Phoenix: Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder. Maya: \"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh? Phoenix: It says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK? Maya: C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick! Phoenix: Do I look like a pencil holder to you? Public phone Maya: I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it? Phoenix: The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there. Maya: Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think? Phoenix: ...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya. After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate: February 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo! Pearl: Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy! Maya: Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum! Phoenix: ...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional. Maya: What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!? Pearl: Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes! ???: Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you. Phoenix: Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.) Maya: Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...? ???: Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm... Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Elise: Yes, that's right... You know of me? Pearl: M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan! Maya: Who is she, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...? Pearl: I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim! Elise: Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise. Phoenix: Um, \"books\"...? Pearl: Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is? Phoenix: Well, um... ...An author, maybe? Elise: Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books. Maya: Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it... Talk Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books. Elise: It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children. Pearl: And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified. Elise: Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that. Phoenix: (I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.) Pearl: Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"! Elise: Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book. Phoenix: Wow... It must have been a really great story. Maya: ...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick. Elise: Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say. Phoenix: An apprentice? Elise: He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support. Pearl: Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you! Elise: Ha ha ha... Why come here? Pearl: Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training? Elise: Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on. Pearl: Wow! I-I can't wait to read it! Phoenix: (Pearls is completely taken with her...) Elise: I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time. Phoenix: ...So is that why you're dressed like you are? Elise: The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them... Phoenix: (What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...) Pearl: Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun! Elise: Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well. Maya: ...I want a staff like that. Elise: You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know. Maya: Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one! Present Anything Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this? Pearl: Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect? Phoenix: Huh...? Pearl: You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.) Maya: Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend. After clearing all Talk options: Elise: Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations. Pearl: Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight? Elise: That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can! Phoenix: (Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...) Maya: Oh, I'll help too, then... Elise: ...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend. Maya: Huh!? But... Elise: ...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we? Phoenix: (The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple. Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record. Pearl: OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight! Maya: Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving! February 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate Maya: Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? Phoenix: I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out. Maya: Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris? Phoenix: Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...) Maya: ...? February 7Inner Temple Gate Maya: Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake. Phoenix: ... Maya: And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release) Phoenix: ... Maya: Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong with you? Your face is all green. Phoenix: C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap. Maya: Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release) Phoenix: I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight? Maya: That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something! Phoenix: (A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?) Examine Bridge Phoenix: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again. Maya: No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money. Phoenix: That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string! Maya: Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know. Phoenix: ... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods. Maya: ...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you? Suspension wire Maya: It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires. Phoenix: ...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...? Maya: Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did! Phoenix: ... Maya: What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again. Buddha statues Maya: Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me. Phoenix: Maya! Maya: But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one. Phoenix: Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway? Maya: Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these! Phoenix: (You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?) Incinerator Maya: Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow! Phoenix: ... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator. Maya: Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot. Phoenix: Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty. Maya: Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk? Phoenix: I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either. Maya: Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance. Phoenix: (A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?) Yellow gate Maya: Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat! Phoenix: Yeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\". Maya: Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know. Phoenix: ...You expect a lawyer to go along with that? Maya: Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go! Phoenix: Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you. Maya: ... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK? Wooden log on left Maya: Looks like there's something written on it. Phoenix: I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\". Maya: What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here. Phoenix: (I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...) Gate Maya: So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh? Phoenix: It looks kinda run-down. Maya: Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny. Phoenix: So you're training here tonight, huh? Maya: Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers! ...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh... Phoenix: Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead... Maya: I wonder if that roast is ready yet? February 7Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh... Maya: Huh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one. Phoenix: Really? But I thought... Maya: Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training. Phoenix: (So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release) Maya: Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release) ???: Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ... Phoenix: Y-You're... Maya: Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight... ???: ... Maya: ...? Is something wrong? ???: Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing... Maya: I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick? Phoenix: Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya? Maya: ... Not you too, Nick... Iris: I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple. Maya: I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you! Iris: The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to. Maya: She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: (That girl... It-It can't be, but...) Maya: ...? Examine Dresser drawers Maya: Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick. Phoenix: ... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking. Maya: Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick! Mattresses Phoenix: There are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? Maya: It's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? Phoenix: (But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?) Sacred cavern entrance Maya: The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me! Phoenix: ...I can't. Maya: ... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S. Phoenix: ... Maya: Ha ha ha ha ha! \u266aIris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!\u266a Hanging scroll Phoenix: (A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...) Maya: AAAAAAH! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!? Maya: Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother... Phoenix: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!? Maya: ...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling... Phoenix: Are... Are you sure? Maya: Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition. Phoenix: (So that's what the mark means...) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face. Phoenix: Maya... Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to the Fey family... Maya: I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School. Phoenix: (I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.) After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall: February 7Dusky Bridge Maya: Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge. Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet. Phoenix: Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry... ???: Hey, you! ...Wait up! Maya: ...? You think he's yelling at us? Phoenix: He must be. There's no one else around... ???: Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah! Maya: Hey! I know you! You're... ???: Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait a minute! ???: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim. Phoenix: Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz. Butz: Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge! Maya: So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else. Talk Laurice Deauxnim Phoenix: So what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"? Butz: Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate! Maya: A clean slate...? Butz: You remember don't you? Last time? Phoenix: (The Mask\u2606DeMasque case...) Butz: After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny! Maya: The \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...? Butz: \"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved! Phoenix: (Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...) Maya: Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too! Elise Deauxnim Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Butz: You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints! Photo of Elise added to the Court Record. Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Butz: She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere! Maya: Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady. Butz: You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret! Maya: Wow! That's a beautiful photo! Picture books Phoenix: Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right? Butz: Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women! Maya: ...Talk about a bad case of denial. Phoenix: Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book? Butz: Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart! Phoenix: And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book? Butz: ...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder. Maya: It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart. Butz: It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began. Maya: Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Butz: No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl! Phoenix: \"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Present Maya Fey profile Butz: Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you. Maya: Oh, really!? Butz: Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick? Phoenix: (Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.) Mia Fey profile Butz: Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister! Maya: Wow! You really do remember! Butz: Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba! Maya: You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous! Phoenix: (Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...) Pearl Fey profile Butz: I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger. Phoenix: Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict. Butz: Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast. Phoenix: ...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell. Butz: Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all. Phoenix: (Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...) Bikini profile Maya: She seems really motherly, doesn't she? Butz: What do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother. Maya: ...She's your WHAT!? Butz: I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one. Phoenix: (Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?) Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me. Phoenix: Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes. Butz: When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened! Phoenix: (Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?) Iris profile Butz: Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris! Maya: She's really pretty. Butz: This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her. Maya: Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...? Butz: Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But... Maya: \"But\"...? Butz: But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream... Phoenix: (This guy will never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Phoenix: (Picky, picky, aren't you...?) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile: Pearl: Everyone! Maya: Hey! Pearly! Pearl: Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall! Maya: Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly! Pearl: I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training... February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Maya: Boy am I stuffed... Phoenix: Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training? Maya: Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance. Pearl: Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk. Maya: Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess. Pearl: Nngh... I'm still worried about you... Bikini: Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight. Elise: Good luck. ...Maya. Maya: Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess! Bikini: Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini. Bikini: And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall. Iris: I understand, Sister Bikini. Phoenix: (Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...) Elise: ...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight? Pearl: Well, umm... Elise: If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Ah! I'd love to! Phoenix: (Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do? Butz: Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all. Phoenix: (I totally hear you there.) Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Pearl: Oh! OK! And what about this word? Elise: That's another tough one. It says, \"roast\". Phoenix: (What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?) Pearl: Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise! Phoenix: (Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...) February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: (Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?) ???: ...Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too? Elise: Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl? Phoenix: No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room... Elise: I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me. Phoenix: (Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...) Iris: Oh... Phoenix: Ah...! S-Sister Iris...! Iris: G... G-Good evening... Phoenix: (The real mysterious one is this girl...!) Iris: Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.) Move Phoenix: ...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here. Talk Iris Phoenix: Um... You're Sister Iris, right? Iris: ...Yes. Phoenix: S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple? Iris: ... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home. Phoenix: So you've never left? Iris: Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were. Phoenix: Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department? Iris: No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need. Phoenix: I... I see... Iris: But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too. Phoenix: ... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...) Iris: P-Please don't stare at me like that... Hazakura Temple Phoenix: What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that. Iris: It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you. Phoenix: Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here... Iris: I'm glad to hear you say that. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it. Phoenix: R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?) Present Anything Phoenix: (Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?) After clearing all Talk options: Iris: Ah... Phoenix: Is something wrong? Iris: I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out... Phoenix: (I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?) Iris: ... Um... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Yes? Iris: If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this. Phoenix: But this is your hood... Iris: It has the power to protect you from evil spirits. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...) Iris: I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night. Iris's Hood received from Iris. Iris: I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight. Phoenix: Wait a minute, Sister Iris... Iris: Y-Yes...? Phoenix: Just now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you. Iris: Th-That's... Phoenix: ...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before? Iris: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-Iris... Iris: O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow. *gong* *gong* *gong* Phoenix: (So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!) February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim! ...*squish* Phoenix: (...I just stepped on something soft.) Bikini: Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that! Phoenix: Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!? Bikini: I was passed out! What do you think!? Phoenix: So that blood-curdling scream was you...? Bikini: F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police! Phoenix: Is there even a phone in the Main Hall? Bikini: No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!? Phoenix: I, um... I didn't bring it with me-- Bikini: Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Bikini: If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...! February 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge Phoenix: ...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?) Butz: What are you doing here? Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Butz: Huh? What is it? Is it me? Phoenix: D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack! Butz: My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice! Phoenix: Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple! Butz: D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now! Phoenix: Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple! Butz: Wha-Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe! Butz: B-B-But... Phoenix: Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry! Butz: It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait! Phoenix: (I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...) ...*crack!*... Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Butz: Niiiiiick----! Phoenix: (Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.) To be continued. Date:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Phone: *RIIING*... *RIIING*... ???: (Who could that be at this time of night...?) Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: ...Yes? Edgeworth speaking... Butz: Edgey! Get up! It's an emergency! Edgeworth: ...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is? Butz: It's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: (... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...) Butz: W-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill! Edgeworth: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, so... Butz: I'm not joking! His life is in danger! Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me! Butz: Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...! Edgeworth: Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can. Butz: I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy! Phone: ...*beep*... Edgeworth: (It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.) February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Butz: You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!? Edgeworth: I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could! Butz: Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest. Butz: Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris! Edgeworth: (And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for. Butz: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?) Butz: I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her! Edgeworth: ... What did you just say? Butz: You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!? Edgeworth: ...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who... Butz: Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell! Edgeworth: But I... Butz: I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before! Edgeworth: (...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?) Butz: Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story! Edgeworth: (So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...) Iris: Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris. Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder. Iris: Um... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die... Edgeworth: ... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed. Iris: ... Thank goodness... Edgeworth: But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold. Iris: A cold...? Edgeworth: He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness. Iris: ... Edgeworth: (I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: The camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Is something bothering you? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ... Iris: Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me. Move Edgeworth: ...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that ammunition is called, \"information\". Talk Iris Edgeworth: Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before... Iris: I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple? What's that? Iris: It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well? Iris: No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them. Edgeworth: In that case, what are you doing at that temple then? Iris: ... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul. The night of the crime Edgeworth: I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime. Iris: Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00. Edgeworth: Bell...? Iris: ...We ring it at the same time each night. Edgeworth: I see... And then? Iris: A-And then... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there... Edgeworth: Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to? Iris: ...I-I was frightened. Edgeworth: (\"Frightened\"...?) Iris: So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened. Edgeworth: (There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.) Frightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder? Iris: Yes... Edgeworth: However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of? Iris: ...! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (Wh-What in the world!?) Iris: Um... Is there something wrong? Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...) Iris: ...? Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was... Edgeworth: What about last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Iris: Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly... Edgeworth: So there was something special about last night, hmm? Iris: Nngh... Edgeworth: (It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...) Any idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...) Any idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option) Edgeworth: So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night? Iris: ...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed. Edgeworth: Spiritual power...? Iris: Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example... Edgeworth: ...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\". Iris: Yes... I understand. Most people don't. Edgeworth: And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim? Iris: ... No. I'm not the one who took her life. Edgeworth: Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh. Iris: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...) Present Attorney's Badge Iris: Is that an attorney's badge? Edgeworth: Yes, this belongs to Wright. Iris: Really? Edgeworth: I'm actually a prosecutor. Iris: Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...? Edgeworth: Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it. Hanging Scroll Edgeworth: Who is the woman on this hanging scroll? Iris: Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: M-Master? Iris: Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago. Edgeworth: ... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway... Iris: Mr. Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds! Iris: ...? Edgeworth: (She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...) Iris's Hood Iris: That's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night. Edgeworth: He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today. Iris: It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits. Edgeworth: If it's so important, then why did you give it to him? Iris: Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. Edgeworth: (Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Iris: ...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur. Edgeworth: In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you? Iris: It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so. Edgeworth: (She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Iris: That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard. Edgeworth: Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...? Iris: No... This was her first time. It's just that... Edgeworth: ...? Iris: She was a very important visitor. Edgeworth: Is that so? Iris: Yes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\" Edgeworth: (The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...) Phoenix Wright profile Iris: Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold? Edgeworth: Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems. Iris: ...Really? Edgeworth: Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him. Iris: No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me. Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was? Iris: Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think. Edgeworth: (Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?) Iris: He's a very sincere, hard-working person. Edgeworth: ... Iris: Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...) Iris profile Iris: You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid. Edgeworth: Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: So you two must have crossed paths somewhere. Iris: ...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me. Edgeworth: (What is that supposed to mean?) Anything else Iris: I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me. Iris: Thank you very much for listening to my story. Edgeworth: ...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you... Iris: ...M-Me? Edgeworth: Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you. Iris: ... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands. Edgeworth: But before that, I have one question. Iris: Yes? Edgeworth: Do you know Wright? Iris: Er... Wh-Why would you ask that? Edgeworth: Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange. Iris: ... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release) Iris: ... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him. Edgeworth: You \"deceived\" him...? Iris: I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth. Edgeworth: ... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth. Iris: ... Edgeworth: I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition. Iris: ... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise. Edgeworth: ...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...) February 8Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: (It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...) ???: Oh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Nngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer? Edgeworth: It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here. Gumshoe: Oh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Let me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release) Gumshoe: I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir. Edgeworth: (...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!) Gumshoe: I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty! Edgeworth: ...Great. Um, thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you! Edgeworth: (...Prosecutor Godot?) Examine Cliff on other side Edgeworth: It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff. Gumshoe: Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so. Edgeworth: ... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards. Gumshoe: Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances. Edgeworth: (It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...) Wooden sign on left side Gumshoe: There's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\". Edgeworth: A shack...? Gumshoe: It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir. Edgeworth: The name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace... Gumshoe: Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"... Edgeworth: ...That's not such a great name, if you ask me. Gumshoe: Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir. Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross? Gumshoe: Pretty reckless, if you ask me. Edgeworth: I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here... Gumshoe: Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck. Edgeworth: (I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.) Boulder Edgeworth: Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name. Gumshoe: You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir. Edgeworth: You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time. Gumshoe: ... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake! Public phone Gumshoe: Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore! Edgeworth: ...That's true. Gumshoe: Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento! Edgeworth: Well, um, sure. Why not? Gumshoe: Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir! Edgeworth: (What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?) Talk What happened (before visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Edgeworth: \"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain? Gumshoe: ...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir. Edgeworth: (I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...) What happened (after visitng Main Hall) Edgeworth: I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case... Gumshoe: It's simple! Edgeworth: Well, simple is as simple does, as they say. Gumshoe: Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing! Edgeworth: A witness...? Gumshoe: Yeah, that Bikini lady. Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: So this is the bridge that Wright fell through? Gumshoe: Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...? Edgeworth: And? Is there something on the other side? Gumshoe: Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir. Edgeworth: What...? Gumshoe: Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there. Edgeworth: Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey. Gumshoe: Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir. Edgeworth: (Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway? Gumshoe: We're almost 100% sure it was lightning. Edgeworth: ...Lightning? Prosecutor Godot Edgeworth: So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him. Gumshoe: Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy. Edgeworth: What kind of a man is he? Gumshoe: He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good. Edgeworth: (If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case? Gumshoe: You bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it. Edgeworth: \"You know who\"? Gumshoe: Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Oh? Gumshoe: Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge. Edgeworth: And what would be the cause of this grudge...? Gumshoe: I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something. Edgeworth: (None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.) Lightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\") Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Weather Data added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Lightning (subsequent times) Edgeworth: You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning? Gumshoe: Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck. Edgeworth: Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge... Gumshoe: Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony. Edgeworth: Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness? Gumshoe: ... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Is it really that odd? Gumshoe: You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill! Edgeworth: (Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?) Magatama Edgeworth: Have you ever seen this thing before...? Gumshoe: Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!* Edgeworth: Wh-What are you doing, Detective!? Gumshoe: Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time... Edgeworth: (Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really. Edgeworth: That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author? Gumshoe: I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular. Phoenix Wright profile Gumshoe: Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\" Edgeworth: (I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago. Gumshoe: R-Really? I thought so! Edgeworth: No, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\". Gumshoe: I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff. Edgeworth: I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...? Gumshoe: ...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir. Larry Butz profile Gumshoe: He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something. Edgeworth: ...I see. Gumshoe: Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Gumshoe: But he made me pay him 50 cents for it. Edgeworth: ...I'm sorry about that. Gumshoe: ... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why. Iris profile Edgeworth: I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she? Gumshoe: Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing. Edgeworth: I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...) Gumshoe: Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger. Edgeworth: D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!? Gumshoe: I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir. Edgeworth: (...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?) Godot profile Edgeworth: I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person. Gumshoe: I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand... Edgeworth: Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man... Gumshoe: Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately. Anything else Gumshoe: Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK? Edgeworth: ...That's not something to be proud of, Detective! February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: (It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories. Gumshoe: Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time! Edgeworth: (I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know. Gumshoe: ...*gasp!* ... Edgeworth: Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...! Gumshoe: ...Too late, I already did. Edgeworth: (In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...) Examine Surveillance camera Edgeworth: That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard. Guard Edgeworth: The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me. February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Butz: Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet. Edgeworth: ...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country. Butz: Wh-What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder! Gumshoe: ...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and... Butz: What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!? Gumshoe: Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.) Butz: Hmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release) Edgeworth: ...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here. Butz: Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one! Edgeworth: Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.) Examine Gate Edgeworth: This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time. Gumshoe: That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir! Edgeworth: I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance. Gumshoe: That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age! Edgeworth: Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective. Main Hall Edgeworth: That must be the Main Hall back there. Gumshoe: A brilliant deduction, sir! Edgeworth: ............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir! Edgeworth: (According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...) Bell tower Edgeworth: I can see a small bell tower from here. Gumshoe: Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about... Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: We call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight! Edgeworth: (I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...) Snowmobile Edgeworth: I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Say, this just gave me a great idea! Edgeworth: (Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...) Gumshoe: I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich! Edgeworth: An invention...? Gumshoe: Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that? Edgeworth: ...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides. Talk Iris Butz: Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you? Edgeworth: ... Butz: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Edgeworth: To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent... Butz: Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer! Edgeworth: ... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back. Butz: No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest! Edgeworth: (If I had a penny for every time he's said that...) Butz: It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean? Edgeworth: Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry. Butz: Oh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything... Edgeworth: ...? The night of the crime Edgeworth: Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime? Butz: ... Edgeworth: Larry...? Butz: What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!? Edgeworth: Wh-What...? Butz: Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die! Edgeworth: ... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: (As I suspected... Psycholocks!) (Changed from [As I suspected... a Psycholock!] in the original release) Butz: I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude! The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted. Butz: B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Edgeworth: (If that's what you think, then get a job already!) Butz: D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me! Butz: Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying? Edgeworth: (...I have no idea what you're blathering about.) Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people,\" or something like that. Edgeworth: ...That was a long time ago. Butz: But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris! Edgeworth: ... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Butz: ...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you! Edgeworth: Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that. Butz: ...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!? Edgeworth: ... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright. Phoenix Wright profile Butz: He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories. Edgeworth: What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know! Butz: Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life. Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Butz: If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby! Edgeworth: (He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!) Larry Butz profile Butz: Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore. Edgeworth: What...? Butz: I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim! Edgeworth: ... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry. Butz: Call me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"! Iris profile Edgeworth: I have a feeling that she's hiding something... Butz: Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily. Edgeworth: ...I don't think that has anything to do with it. Butz: Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right! Edgeworth: Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself! Butz: Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean? Edgeworth: (Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.) Anything else Butz: Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif. Edgeworth: (...He didn't even give it a glance.) February 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: *sigh* Gumshoe: Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling? Bikini: Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this? Edgeworth: I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth. Bikini: My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just... Edgeworth: (Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini. Bikini: Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis... Bikini: Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness. Edgeworth: ... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut! Gumshoe: Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest... Bikini: So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!? Edgeworth: Well, first... I want to hear what you know. Examine Walls or sliding doors Edgeworth: There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls. Gumshoe: Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here. Bikini: This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering. Gumshoe: So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright! Edgeworth: (Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?) Objects on floor Gumshoe: Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats? Edgeworth: ...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room. Gumshoe: Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees! Edgeworth: Those are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"! Gumshoe: ... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why? Edgeworth: Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective! Altar Edgeworth: It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it. Gumshoe: There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while... Edgeworth: Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me? Bikini: S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles! Magatama on altar Edgeworth: ...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room. Bikini: This is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls. Gumshoe: Huh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like? Bikini: The \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors. Left corner near altar Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...? Gumshoe: Hmm... Beats me. Edgeworth: Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: It looks like an old manila envelope... Gumshoe: Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!! Edgeworth: ...What is it, Detective? Gumshoe: Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I should read it myself then. Gumshoe: It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\" Edgeworth: Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...! Note to Iris added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Left corner near altar (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) Gumshoe: Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor! Edgeworth: Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this. Talk The night of the crime Edgeworth: First, I'd like to ask you about last night. Bikini: Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple. Edgeworth: (She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...? Bikini: I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch. Gumshoe: Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting! Edgeworth: Detective, this is no time for flattery. Gumshoe: Sorry. Edgeworth: Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here? Bikini: Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.) Gumshoe: Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth? What you saw Edgeworth: Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard. Bikini: It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart! Gumshoe: Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie! Bikini: ...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword! Edgeworth: Did you see this criminal with your own eyes? Bikini: I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris! Edgeworth: You must have been quite shocked. Gumshoe: Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too. Bikini: I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.) Bikini: However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural. Edgeworth: \"Unnatural\"...? Bikini: The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness... Edgeworth: (...I wonder what she means by that?) Why return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Edgeworth: As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct? Bikini: Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back. Edgeworth: A bad lower back...? Bikini: Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall. Edgeworth: So you left the disciple all alone? Bikini: Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out. Edgeworth: (Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...) The acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\") Edgeworth: So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...? Bikini: Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course... Gumshoe: \"Special Course\"? Bikini: It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times... Edgeworth: You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you? Bikini: No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself. Edgeworth: Well, um... That's good to hear. Bikini: ...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Gumshoe: ...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this. Bikini: Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister. Edgeworth: (Maya has a little sister...?) Gumshoe: Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin. Edgeworth: Little... Pearl...? Bikini: I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found! Edgeworth: Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!? Bikini: It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back! Edgeworth: (A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Present Magatama Bikini: Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Bikini: Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult! Edgeworth: Excuse me? Bikini: Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition! Gumshoe: W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me! Edgeworth: (I should have known better than to show this thing around...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Edgeworth: \"Fey\"... Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter. Edgeworth: Who is this daughter? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family... Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Edgeworth: Oh, I see... Bikini: What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already! Edgeworth: No! I can't...! I was just...! Bikini: ... Ha ha ha ho ho ho! Gumshoe: Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What do you mean by that, Detective!? Bikini: It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while! Edgeworth: (Is this some sort of divine retribution...?) \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Edgeworth: About this picture... Bikini: Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!? Gumshoe: Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely. Bikini: Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons... Edgeworth: Is that so? For exampl--? Bikini: Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: ...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault! Gumshoe: Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself. Bikini: Quiet! What do you know anyway!? Gumshoe: ...Ouch. You're scary! Bikini: With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared! Gumshoe: ... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me? Edgeworth: (Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.) Note to Iris Edgeworth: Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter? Bikini: ... Is that addressed to Iris? Gumshoe: Yup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it. Bikini: I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me... Edgeworth: (Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...) Phoenix Wright profile Bikini: This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world. Edgeworth: ...Um, sure. Bikini: But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh... Edgeworth: ... Edgeworth: (It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir! Larry Butz profile Bikini: This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate. Gumshoe: Huh? Bikini: Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men. Edgeworth: ...Sure. Bikini: But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...) Iris profile Edgeworth: You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there? Bikini: Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out. Gumshoe: So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then? Bikini: Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony. Edgeworth: (But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!) Gumshoe: As they say... \"The plot thickens!\" Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost! Gumshoe: You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma... Bikini: ...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Edgeworth: \"Honored\"? How so? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Edgeworth: ...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians? Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (...That's got nothing to do with it.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...? Gumshoe: Well, we checked out her home and she's not there. Bikini: And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either... Edgeworth: (Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.) Gumshoe: Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!? Edgeworth: ... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!? Gumshoe: Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!) Anything else Gumshoe: Umm, about this here... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Gumshoe: I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth? Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate) Present Bikini profile Butz: I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother. Edgeworth: ... May I speak now? Butz: Huh? Sure. Edgeworth: I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case. Butz: ... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth: (...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.) After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate: February 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate Edgeworth: ...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere. Gumshoe: Maybe we scared the poor kid away! Edgeworth: (His heart was shut tight with a number of Psycholocks. (Changed from [His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock.] in the original release) I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.) February 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard Gumshoe: And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched! Edgeworth: Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...) Gumshoe: Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow? Edgeworth: Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation... Edgeworth: Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own. Gumshoe: ... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Y-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?) (Changed from [Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)] in the original release) Examine Lantern Edgeworth: It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night. Gumshoe: There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight. Edgeworth: Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...? Gumshoe: ...How did you know? Staff Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Victim's Staff added to the Court Record. Staff (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff. Gumshoe: That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir? Edgeworth: Yes... What? Gumshoe: This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this. Edgeworth: ...Alright. Gumshoe: The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...... Edgeworth: That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me? Gumshoe: That's it. Edgeworth: (This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...) ...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it? Gumshoe: Just the victim's. Ami Fey statue Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Shichishito added to the Court Record. Ami Fey statue (subsequent times) Edgeworth: So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon? Gumshoe: It sure is. It's called a \"Shichishito\" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir. Edgeworth: There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood? Gumshoe: Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of \"all over the blade\"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too. Edgeworth: Fingerprints...? Gumshoe: Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant. Edgeworth: (Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?) Gumshoe: ... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn. Edgeworth: Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense attorney? (Changed from [Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good. Edgeworth: ...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health. Stone wall Edgeworth: The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall. Gumshoe: Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all. Edgeworth: Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words... Top right corner Edgeworth: The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here. Gumshoe: Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor. Edgeworth: Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels. Gumshoe: Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir? Edgeworth: (I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.) Skis, ski poles, or sled Gumshoe: Ah! I just love skiing! Edgeworth: Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds? Gumshoe: Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my \"hard boiled\" image. Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: ...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (I...Is the world starting to go mad?) Talk The victim Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that. Gumshoe: The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon. Edgeworth: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir. Edgeworth: Th-That's terrible... Gumshoe: Yeah, but there's one strange thing. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Gumshoe: The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building. Edgeworth: A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) Elise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.] in the original release) The victim (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery. Edgeworth: It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that.

That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in! Edgeworth: (Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?) What happened Edgeworth: ...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far. Gumshoe: OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall. Edgeworth: (The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...) Tomorrow's trial Edgeworth: The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor? Gumshoe: I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Gumshoe: It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest. Edgeworth: I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge... Edgeworth: ...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all. Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir? Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing. Gumshoe: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull! Inner Temple (appears after \"What happened\") Edgeworth: What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...? Gumshoe: According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: (The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple? Gumshoe: Nope, not a thing. Edgeworth: Nothing? Gumshoe: The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there. Edgeworth: (So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in. Edgeworth: (Please be alright, Maya...) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid... Edgeworth: You wanted to become a wizard, right? Gumshoe: Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think? Edgeworth: We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective! Shichishito Gumshoe: This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Edgeworth: Hmm... I've never heard that one. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division. Edgeworth: ...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Edgeworth: (...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.) Bikini profile Gumshoe: This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir. Edgeworth: So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...? Gumshoe: Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!? Edgeworth: (Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her. Gumshoe: Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...? Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke! Edgeworth: I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct? Gumshoe: That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero. Edgeworth: (In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night? Gumshoe: Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir. Edgeworth: But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night? Gumshoe: No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!? Edgeworth: D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions! Gumshoe: Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce! After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard: February 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room Iris: Ah... Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Iris: But I... I've already told you everything that I... Edgeworth: ...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything. Iris: Y-Yes... Th-Thank you. Talk Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night? Iris: Yes. That's exactly right. Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret. Iris: ... But it's pointless... Edgeworth: Why would you say that? Iris: Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am. Frightened? (subsequent times) Iris: After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it... Edgeworth: What is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions? Iris: It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge. Edgeworth: A small shack, huh...? Iris: It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near. Edgeworth: Hmm... Where is it on this map...? Iris: ...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release) Edgeworth: So this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release) Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: (It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) Inner Temple Edgeworth: I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword. Iris: ... Edgeworth: And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well. Iris: What...!? Edgeworth: When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night. Iris: B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night. Edgeworth: (Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?) Present Magatama Edgeworth: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- I Was Frightened -- Edgeworth: Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Edgeworth: The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...? Iris: Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that. Edgeworth: ...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened. Iris: ...Th-That's right. Edgeworth: If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\" Iris: ... Edgeworth: Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!? Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!? Iris: I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong... Edgeworth: Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that? Iris: It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me... Edgeworth: Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned. Iris: N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat. Edgeworth: Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery. Iris: But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night. Leads back to: \"If that's the case...\" Edgeworth: I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you. Iris: Ah... Th-That's...! Edgeworth: Well, Iris...? Iris: Why... Why are you glaring at me like that? Edgeworth: You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!? Iris: Aaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: (Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.) Iris: B-But, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Yes? Iris: I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me... Edgeworth: A \"prank\"? Iris: Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief. Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I wonder about that. Iris: Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her! Edgeworth: No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different. Iris: ...! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to! Present Phoenix Wright profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Phoenix Wright...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, Iris? Iris: ...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart? Edgeworth: ...! Why do you say that...!? Iris: As they say, it takes one to know one. Edgeworth: (How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth! Iris: You mean... the truth behind my secret? Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\" Edgeworth: Phoenix Wright... Iris: Ah...! Edgeworth: You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say? Iris: ... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Note to Iris Edgeworth: This letter... It appears to be addressed to you. Iris: ... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away. Edgeworth: (She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.) Shichishito Iris: I-Is that the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before? Iris: Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard... Edgeworth: (And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...) Iris: ...? Larry Butz profile Iris: Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me. Edgeworth: (Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.) Bikini profile Edgeworth: ...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple. Iris: She raised me as if she were my real mother. Edgeworth: \"As if she were your real mother\"...? Iris: I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since. Edgeworth: Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family? Iris: ... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this. Maya Fey profile Iris: Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman. Edgeworth: ... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.) Pearl Fey profile Iris: This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy! Edgeworth: ...Oh? Iris: She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room. Edgeworth: (That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...) February 8Heavenly Hall Gumshoe: Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though. Edgeworth: Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective! ???: Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Butz: Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck. Gumshoe: ...He's just talking to himself. Edgeworth: Shh! Be quiet and listen! Butz: I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again... Edgeworth: (\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...) Gumshoe: Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection! Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat! Edgeworth: *glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!) Gumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger! Edgeworth: ...You've watched too many trials. Gumshoe: I'm sorry! Edgeworth: OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself? Butz: Ungh... Examine Eagle River Gumshoe: This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter. Edgeworth: If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble. Gumshoe: You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where. Edgeworth: (...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...) Dusky Bridge Edgeworth: It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here. Butz: Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really. Edgeworth: ...? What is it, Larry? Butz: Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing! Gumshoe: Sounds pretty suspicious to me! Edgeworth: (Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...) Stairway Edgeworth: These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk. Gumshoe: I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir! Butz: Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here... Gumshoe: ... What!? So that's what I was slipping on! Butz: Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there. Gumshoe: Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth! String of flags Edgeworth: What is this festive-looking ornament? Butz: It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember? Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Butz: Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it. Gumshoe: Really? Butz: Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. Gumshoe: Really? I never would have expected that. Edgeworth: Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw! Butz: ... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...) Shack Gumshoe: That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal. Butz: You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris. Edgeworth: Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is? Butz: ... It's how the artist himself defines it, right? Edgeworth: ... (I should've seen that one coming.) Gumshoe: Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal! Roof Edgeworth: The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow. Gumshoe: Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look. Edgeworth: \"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense. Butz: You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell. Edgeworth: ... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people. Talk Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: What is this little shack anyway? Butz: Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday. Edgeworth: And why were you down here in the first place? Butz: Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse. Gumshoe: ...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal. Edgeworth: (One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...) Butz: So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe? Gumshoe: ...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir. Iris Butz: ...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris! Edgeworth: Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute? Butz: Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl! Edgeworth: ... Gumshoe: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you? Butz: No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that! Edgeworth: Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed. Butz: That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt? Gumshoe: ... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back... Edgeworth: Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.) The night of the crime Edgeworth: Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night? Butz: Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me... Edgeworth: ... Butz: O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: \"Something incredible\"? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: ...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water. Edgeworth: (Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What exactly did you see last night? Butz: Well... It's kinda hard to say... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Butz: It's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Edgeworth: (I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...) The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Edgeworth: So you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you? Butz: S-Sorry, Edgey... Gumshoe: Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that... Butz: *gulp*... ... Wait, hold up. Gumshoe: ...What now, pal? Butz: What are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!? Gumshoe: I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal! Butz: What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!? Gumshoe: \"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact! Butz: Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!? Edgeworth: Wh-What did you just say!? Butz: My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain! Edgeworth: O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!? Butz: Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair! Edgeworth: ... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!? Butz: Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh! Gumshoe: Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!? Butz: It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his! Edgeworth: ... ... Butz: What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: That's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive... Butz: Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down! Gumshoe: ... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it! Edgeworth: What do you mean, Detective? Gumshoe: Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago! Butz: If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He's right!) Larry! Butz: Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone! Edgeworth: What was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another! Something incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Leads to: \"I... I already told you, didn't I?\" Present Magatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option) Edgeworth: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Edgeworth: Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night... Butz: Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk! Edgeworth: ...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...) Butz: Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi! Edgeworth: ...And then? Butz: And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire! Edgeworth: Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes? Butz: Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth! Edgeworth: (Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen? Butz: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: What do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question! Butz: I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!? Edgeworth: As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there... Butz: Th-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there? Edgeworth: It's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room! Present Hazakura Temple Map Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Look at this, Larry! Butz: ... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold. Edgeworth: Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.) Butz: Well? Have you calmed down yet? Edgeworth: Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again. Butz: H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers. Leads back to: \"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\" Edgeworth: This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple. Butz: Wh-What am I looking for? Edgeworth: I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here. Butz: What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Edgeworth: ...Well? How about it? Butz: How about what? Edgeworth: Do you feel like talking now? Butz: About what? Edgeworth: ... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you? Butz: Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room! Edgeworth: (So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here! Present Heavenly Hall Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!? Butz: Oh... Not much I guess. Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that? Butz: Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something. Edgeworth: ...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk? Butz: To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha... Edgeworth: (It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.) Leads back to: \"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\" Edgeworth: The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall! Butz: ...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute... Edgeworth: Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet. Butz: Ah... Uh-oh! Edgeworth: In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset! 1 LOCK BROKEN Butz: I have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick. Edgeworth: ...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night? Butz: That's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\". Edgeworth: I think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone? Butz: Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know... Edgeworth: I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you! Present Iris profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...? Butz: ...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Butz: It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me! Edgeworth: (Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone! Butz: Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\". Edgeworth: No, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do. Leads back to: \"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\" Edgeworth: There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry. Butz: I told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"... Edgeworth: The person you were waiting for was... Iris! Butz: Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey. Edgeworth: No doubt because of my chilly glare. Butz: So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing? Edgeworth: (This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris... Present Note to Iris Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Here's your evidence.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... I-Is it just me? Edgeworth: Now, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold... Butz: Maybe it's because of my cold laugh? Edgeworth: (Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...) Butz: Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey? Leads back to: \"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\" Edgeworth: ...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter! Butz: Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!? Edgeworth: That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry. Butz: What do you mean...? Edgeworth: Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! Butz: Ohhh... OHHHH! Edgeworth: First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"! Butz: W-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"! Edgeworth: You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"! Butz: WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Victim's Staff Butz: That's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh? Edgeworth: What is it, Larry? Butz: There's something missing from this staff... Edgeworth: (There's something missing...?) Maya Fey profile Butz: Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...) Butz: I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too... Edgeworth: ...Or something worse. Pearl Fey profile Butz: Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah? Edgeworth: Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning. Butz: Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Butz: If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: ...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir. Edgeworth: (Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...) Butz: I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge! Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true. Butz: Wh-What doesn't? Edgeworth: If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning. (Changed from [I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.] in the original release) Butz: ... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!? Gumshoe: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal! Butz: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Edgeworth: ...Nooooooooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong, sir? Edgeworth: D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again? Butz: Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!? Edgeworth: (I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Miles Edgeworth) Edgeworth: There aren't any clues here. Exit Magatama session Edgeworth: (It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Edgeworth... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Edgeworth: (Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!)\n-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --Butz: I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half? Butz: Well, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess. Judge: Hmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...? Butz: I set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too. Edgeworth: ...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end. von Karma: Because they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they? Butz: Shut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her.Butz: I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This \"light\" was, of course... Butz: Lightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah! von Karma: ...Or a little like that? Butz: Waaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda! Judge: Witness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge? Butz: Well, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so...Butz: I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Seeing that, what did you do? Butz: What do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart! von Karma: And that's why you went to take a look at the bridge? Butz: Well. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind. Judge: Hmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness.Butz: There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that? Butz: Hmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\" von Karma: How far is this small shack you were in from the bridge? Butz: Hold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk? Edgeworth: And how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there? Butz: Like I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare! Edgeworth: (...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?) Not right now. Edgeworth: (I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.) Judge: ...Witness. Please continue your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Why didn't you call anyone? Edgeworth: ...Larry. Let me ask you one thing. Butz: What is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face? Edgeworth: Why didn't you call anyone? Butz: Huh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Normally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct? Butz: ... Well, of course I thought of doing that. Judge: So then... let's hear why you didn't! Butz: H-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" Why did you go to the bridge? Edgeworth: So you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so? Butz: W-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there. Edgeworth: If that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning. Judge: In which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness! Butz: M-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...? Changes statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\"Butz: That's when I ran into Nick.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did Phoenix Wright look when you met him? Butz: Hmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment. von Karma: How far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge? Butz: On his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say. Judge: ...And that's when the murder was reported? Butz: That's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge!Butz: I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright? Butz: Y-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway. Edgeworth: (What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!) von Karma: It was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct? Butz: Yeah. That's pretty much it. More or less.Present Weather Data Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\"Butz: I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you decided to go and see what was happening? Butz: That's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special? Edgeworth: (Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce \"spectacle\"?) Judge: Life seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt... Butz: Well, my motto is to \"hit life back as hard as I can.\" A-Agah! von Karma: ...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip.Edgeworth: (...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.)Edgeworth: Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...Butz: What the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien!Edgeworth: But your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time.Butz: I've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those.Edgeworth: ...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct?Butz: Yeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less.Edgeworth: ...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM.Butz: ...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act.Edgeworth: That is impossible.von Karma: ...What do you mean?Edgeworth: 11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time!von Karma: ...!Butz: Ah! Excuse me! I-I have an objection!Judge: You do?Butz: Edgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah!von Karma: ...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that!Edgeworth: ...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM!von Karma: And why not!?Edgeworth: It is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM!Judge: Which means... what, exactly?Edgeworth: Wright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!?Butz: Urk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me!Judge: Order! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh!von Karma: ...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem!Butz: Yeah! Not much of a problem at all!Edgeworth: Really...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident?Judge: Yes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release)Edgeworth: And therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release)von Karma: Th-That's what it sounds like...Edgeworth: Ah, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release)Butz: ... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude.Edgeworth: ...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time.Butz: Listen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!?Edgeworth: Y-Yes...Butz: I may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah!von Karma: ...Then say it!Judge: Very well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!?Witness Testimony-- The Missing 15 Minutes --Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing? Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art! The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.Judge: Hmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk...Butz: That's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch!Edgeworth: (...Including the truth, from the sound of it!)Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts?Edgeworth: Not at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains.Judge: And what would that be?Edgeworth: This is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him!Butz: Hah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Missing 15 Minutes --Butz: I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tell us, Larry... Butz: My name is Laurice! Get it right! Mistakes like that are what keep you from being popular with the ladies like I am! Judge: ... Just who exactly are you!? Butz: I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Apprentice extraordinaire! Edgeworth: That's what he calls himself, in any case. Judge: ...Then you are... an artist? Butz: Of course! I'm an artist, the real thing! Edgeworth: Yet again, that's what he calls himself. von Karma: ...Names mean nothing. There is only one issue I care to discuss. What were you doing? Edgeworth: (That is a very big issue, indeed.)Butz: Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: S-Sketching!? The burning bridge? Butz: The burning bridge and everything that came with it! Edgeworth: ... What? \"Came with it\"...? Butz: You want to hear this from my lips, do you, Edgey!? Y-You'll regret this! That sketch of mine is... Gaaah! von Karma: ...Enough. Just take that ridiculous sketch of yours out already, witness! Butz: ... W-W-W-What are you talking about? I don't know what you mean! Judge: That does indeed appear to be the fastest solution. ...I'll leave it to you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (What should I do...? I've got a terrible feeling that the instant this sketch is revealed... ...the entire world may be changed by what is depicted there...!) Leave it alone Edgeworth: ...I cannot recommend looking at the sketch. His \"works of art\" are a force of nature best measured on the Richter scale. Butz: That's right! They'll shake your heart to pieces! Judge: Hmmmm... This courtroom has yet to meet earthquake standards! I think we'd better pass! ...In which case, let us turn to other leads. Leads back to cross-examination Look at the sketch Edgeworth: ...Larry. I wonder if you could show us your sketch. Please? Butz: ... Well, well... Even I couldn't have imagined it'd turn out like this. Edgeworth: ...Imagined what? Butz: That Laurice Deauxnim's debut would take place here, today, like this! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! von Karma: Show it! Now! Butz: OK... But steel yourselves! This... is the world of Laurice Deauxnim! Judge: ... Ah. Um... Well... So this... this is Dusky Bridge, correct? Q-Quite a large bridge, isn't it? Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Y-Yes, well... I-It's a better drawing than I expected. Butz: Isn't it? Isn't it? I struggled to reproduce those flames. I really did! Judge: ...Yes, I'm sure you did. ... von Karma: ...... Butz: ...... Edgeworth: (Nngh... This is going to get ugly... No one has the bravery to bring it up, it seems... This... mysterious flying object...) ...Larry. Butz: What? Edgeworth: The burning bridge is fine. But... What is that unfortunate looking figure...? Butz: Ah. You spotted that? I thought you might. Edgeworth: However much I might want to ignore it... I can't. Butz: It's Iris, of course! Iris! I wish she'd take better care of herself. We have to plan for our future, you know! What would've happened to her if she had injured herself flying like that...? Edgeworth: ... Larry, please. Answer this next question honestly. Butz: OK. Edgeworth: Are you REALLY claiming to have seen this? Are you claiming to have seen the silhouette of the defendant... ...flying over a bridge that was engulfed in flames...? Butz: Yep. That's what I saw. That's why I drew it! I'm an artist! A real artist! Edgeworth: Are...! von Karma: You...! Judge: High! The girl... She's really high up in this picture! Judge: Uwaaah! What was that for!? von Karma: ...This is all a bad dream. I was hitting you on the cheek to test that theory! Judge: Please whip your own cheek from now on if you wish to test your wild theories! A-Anyway! No court of law will ever acknowledge... ...that p-p-people can f-f-fly! von Karma: ...Actually, there is some precedent for this. Butz: She was flying pretty high, my sweet Iris. She was about 30 feet above the bridge, at least! It was really something to see! Judge: Th-This has to be some kind of m-m-mistake! ...Mr. Edgeworth, please bring the witness back down to earth! Edgeworth: What? Me...!? Judge: This witness is your friend, is he not? von Karma: \"Accessory to foolishness...\" ...Miles Edgeworth. Judge: Let us get back to the cross-examination! By force, if necessary! Mr. Edgeworth, I expect you to expose the obvious contradiction here! Edgeworth: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (Looks like I've got another reason to remember this moron...) Butz: ...Well, what did you think of my debut piece? Judge: Get that thing away from me! Larry's Sketch added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, hurry up and cross-examine him! Adds statement \"I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\"Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Could the reason you were so excited be...? Butz: What do you think!? My girlfriend was flying through the sky! Almost 30 feet above the bridge! I felt like I might start flying myself. Edgeworth: (If only you'd be so kind as to fly out of all of our lives...!) Butz: Anyway! I completely lost myself when I was drawing this scene!Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just where did you see this sight from!? Butz: Hey! No need to shout... When I was lying in bed in that run-down shack... The crack of the lightning bolt made me realize that the bridge was burning. I just watched it for a while from there, thinking how nicely it was burning! Then after about five minutes, I saw it. von Karma: The defendant \"flying\"...? Butz: That's right! That's when I decided to go to the bridge! Judge: ...I see. That all makes sense. Aside from the sketch itself... Edgeworth: (Yes... This sketch doesn't make any sense... I just need to convince the artist that his work is ludicrous.)Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry. What did you really see that night...?\"Butz: The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The burning bridge moved you that much, did it? ...I find that hard to believe. Butz: You moron, Edgey! You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook! von Karma: An artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad! Butz: W-W-What has that got to do with anything!? Judge: I'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness.Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You transfered everything \"directly onto the page\"...? And that is this sketch here? Butz: Yep! Sensational, isn't it? Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway. von Karma: It did? Butz: That's right! The reason she didn't come to me, even though I waited for her... ...Was because she was trapped on the other side of the bridge! Judge: ... Butz: Could it be that Iris... ...undertook that dangerous, despereate flight in order to reach me...!? That's gotta be it! Alright! Go, me! Nice ooooooouch! von Karma: ...Continue. Please.Butz: ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot the passage of time to that extent, did you? Butz: Well... Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else... Edgeworth: (That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.) von Karma: Phoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts. Judge: Aside from doubts of his humanity, eh...Edgeworth: (There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, the testimonies are from Larry Butz, who's testifying about the night of the crime. The key points in his testimony are that he was sketching the burning bridge and saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. The relevant evidence includes Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) which supposedly shows Iris flying over the bridge.\n\nLooking at the evidence list, the Victim's Staff (Evidence 9) mentions that the staff originally had a crystal sphere, but it's missing. Then there's the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) found near Dusky Bridge with blood on it. This suggests that the crystal sphere was part of the staff and was removed, possibly during the crime.\n\nIn Larry's testimony, he claims to have seen Iris flying, which he depicted in his sketch. However, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near the bridge, which came from the staff. If Iris was flying, she wouldn't have been near the bridge to leave the crystal sphere there. The presence of the crystal sphere contradicts his testimony that he saw her flying, because the sphere's location indicates she was on the bridge, not flying. Therefore, the existence of the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) contradicts his testimony about seeing her fly (Testimony 2). But wait, the testimony in question here is Testimony 3 where he talks about transferring his feelings onto the page, which includes the flying image. The actual contradiction is between the sketch (showing flying) and the crystal sphere being found on the bridge, implying she was there physically. But the testimony about transferring the shock and awe (Testimony 3) leads to the sketch, which is contradicted by the physical evidence of the sphere. Alternatively, the sketch (Evidence 15) directly contradicts the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16), but the testimony in question is Testimony 2 or 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is to pick one pair. Let's see: The testimony about seeing Iris flying (Testimony 2) is contradicted by the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) being found on the bridge, showing she was there. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 16 and Testimony 2. But according to the evidence list, the Crystal Sphere is Evidence 16. So the JSON would be {\"evidence\": 16, \"testimony\": 2}."

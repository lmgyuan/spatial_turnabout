The return of the Great Thief Yatagarasu... Thinking back, everything began on that fateful day, two days ago...) Edgeworth: (Yes, everything began high up in the air, 9,000 feet in the air, to be precise...) PA Notice: Thank you for flying GoYou (changed from [iFly] in the original release) Airlines. We are currently experiencing some slight turbulence. We are asking all passengers to please return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts. Edgeworth: ...Nnngh... ...Why do I feel like I just woke up from a horrible nightmare? (6:13, huh... Guess I was out cold for about 10 minutes. Hah, \"slight\" turbulence, indeed.) PA Notice: Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently experiencing some slight turbulence. For your safety, we ask that you return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. Edgeworth: (I suppose turbulence is to be expected on a flight. Though admittedly, I'm less than comfortable with anything resembling earthquakes... Hm? What's this...? A travel wallet? But it's not mine... How did someone else's travel wallet wind up in my pocket...? Nnngh...! My head... Why won't this headache go away...? I'll take care of this travel wallet later. Or hand it off to an attendant...) Unngh... From earthquake-like turbulence to an elevator... ............ Hmph. What am I doing hesitating like this? (Actually, I know full well why I hesitate. It was when I was still but a young child... I was caught up in a murder that happened in an elevator. But how long am I going to let my past haunt me!? It's just an elevator! I'm a grown man now! I need to behave like one!) Wh......What the...!? What in the world happened!? ???: Is there something wrong, sir? I must ask that you please return to your se... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! He... He-He-He's DEAD!!! Edgeworth: Please calm down! We mustn't jump to conclusions without all the facts... Passenger: What's wrong!? Did something happen!? ???: Y... Y-You MURDERER!!! Edgeworth: Wh--!? N-NO! You have it all wrong! It wasn't me!! ???: Everyone, I am sorry to interrupt, but I have an important announcement. Teneiro: I am one of your flight attendants today, Rhoda Teneiro. Unfortunately, we have just had a minor accident on this flight. Passenger: An \"accident\"!? Don't treat us like we're stupid! I caught a glimpse and it was a murder! Passenger: What!? M-Murder!? What's going on with this flight!? Teneiro: Everyone, please calm down. There's no reason to panic. This flight will stay on course and make its scheduled landing. We are still currently in the middle of a rough patch of turbulence. So until we are out of this area of turbulence, I ask that you please remain seated... Passenger: B-B-But, someone was killed, right!? I mean, what about the killer!? Let me off...! Teneiro: Please, there is no need to feel threatened. We have already apprehended the culprit. Edgeworth: I ask that everyone please remain calm. Passenger: What the heck is he talking about!? Why should we remain calm!? Edgeworth: My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor and I assure you I am not the killer. Passenger: Hah! Being a prosecutor doesn't make you incapable of murder, buddy! Edgeworth: Now you listen here! I am not the killer! I simply found the body! Teneiro: So you say, however... ...I am sure that you are the perpetrator of this crime. I swear on my honor as a professional flight attendant. Edgeworth: Oh, is that right? Teneiro: I know what I saw. And there's even very strong, incriminating evidence to back me up. Edgeworth: (What kind of \"incriminating evidence\" is she talking about...?) Teneiro: We've already alerted the proper authorities at our destination. Until we land, you will remain in our custody by the powers vested in our captain. I'm very sorry, but please understand our situation. Edgeworth: (Your situation? I'm more concerned with mine, and the direction it's going in... I'm not about to just sit idly by while I get accused of murder!) Ms... Teneiro, is it? Teneiro: Yes? Edgeworth: I was wondering if you might give me a chance. Teneiro: A chance? To do what? Edgeworth: A chance to plead my case. And a chance to ask what you meant by \"incriminating evidence\" just now. Teneiro: ......... Edgeworth: To accuse a passenger of such a grave crime without allowing him to give a proper defense... Can the professional flight attendant inside of you really call this action \"righteous\"? Teneiro: ......... You have a point. Very well, I'll listen to what you have to say... ...but be wary of what you reveal. I'm afraid you'll only look even more suspicious if your explanation fails to satisfy. I also do not have the time to deal with you all day, so please make it quick. Edgeworth: ...... Of course. As you wish. Teneiro: Good. Very well then, let's get started. Edgeworth: (I know for a fact that I didn't kill that man in the elevator. What I don't know is what sort of \"evidence\" she has up her sleeve... ...but I'm certain it doesn't fit with how the crime really occurred.) Teneiro: I swear to tell the whole truth as a professional flight attendant. Unfortunately for you, Mr. Edgeworth, I am certain you are the killer. The scene I saw in front of the elevator... ...it was you, standing there, with fresh blood dripping off of the murder weapon. So, if you would please cooperate, we'll turn you over just as soon as we land. Edgeworth: (That's it...? That's her evidence...!?) Teneiro: I don't think you could ask for a more perfect witness testimony. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (Not really. It's hardly perfect when there's a gaping hole in it.) Teneiro: I swear to tell the whole truth as a professional flight attendant. Teneiro: Unfortunately for you, Mr. Edgeworth, I am certain you are the killer. Teneiro: The scene I saw in front of the elevator... Teneiro: ...it was you, standing there, with fresh blood dripping off of the murder weapon. Teneiro: So, if you would please cooperate, we'll turn you over just as soon as we land. Edgeworth: (Her mistake shines like the silver lining on a dark rain cloud. And I'm going to capture some of that light with evidence!) Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro! Teneiro: Wh-Wh-What is with the yelling all of a sudden!? Edgeworth: (Argh. Force of habit. Well, it doesn't matter.) Ms. Teneiro. You say you saw the murder weapon dripping with blood. Is that correct? Teneiro: Yes. All that blood... Drip, drip, drip... Just recalling that scene sends a chill down my spine. Edgeworth: Sorry, but your so-called \"professional\" flight attendant training has failed you. Teneiro: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: I'd like to direct your attention to this! Do you know what this is? Teneiro: It's... a travel wallet, right? But it looks a little big and bulky... Edgeworth: The thing you saw me holding when I discovered the dead body in the elevator... ...was this very travel wallet, Ms. Teneiro. Teneiro: What!? Impossible...! Edgeworth: Now then, do you still think I am the killer? That I killed him with a travel wallet? Teneiro: But... But...! I...! No, but I... I saw blood dripping from the wallet! I know I did! Edgeworth: As you can see, this wallet is clearly stained. But if you would be so kind as to take a whiff... ...I think you'd agree it's only grape juice. Teneiro: Ah! Then... Then...! Edgeworth: That's right. You mistook grape juice for blood! The murder weapon dripping with blood does not, in fact, exist! Teneiro: N-Nooooooooooooooo! Edgeworth: (There. That should clear up that pesky accusation.) Teneiro: Teneiro: W-Wait just a sec! That is... I mean, even a wallet could be deadly if it was [sic] wrapped around something heavy! I demand that you show me what's inside... Please... Edgeworth: (She's trembling, and the tacked on \"please\" at the end... Sounds like I've got her.) There's no need to look inside. Even you can tell from its appearance that it's light. Teneiro: No! I can't be sure of anything until I see the contents of that wallet for myself! Edgeworth: (*sigh* She's a persistent one. I suppose we have no choice but to see what's inside.) Ms. Teneiro, if you would be so kind as to open the wallet and check its contents for me. Teneiro: Alright. I usually don't pry into passengers' belongings, but we have no choice here. Leads to examination of travel wallet After examining button of travel wallet: Edgeworth: As you saw, there is nothing but a passport inside. This renders your \"wallet was the murder weapon\" argument moot. Wouldn't you agree? Teneiro: Teneiro: Please, hear me out, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What is it now...? Teneiro: Well, I was wondering... whose passport is it exactly? Edgeworth: ......... Teneiro: Can I take a look...? Edgeworth: Why not? I'm rather curious myself. Th-This is...! Teneiro: Just as I thought... This travel wallet belonged to Mr. Akbey Hicks... ...which makes it the victim's property. Wallet data updated in my Organizer. Teneiro: You... You stole the victim's wallet... ...didn't you...? Edgeworth: H-How dare you!? Teneiro: You said it yourself. You claimed to be holding this wallet in your hands when I found you. Edgeworth: ......... Teneiro: Perhaps I did misconstrue the wallet for the murder weapon.... ...but it seems that I wasn't wrong about who the culprit is. Teneiro: As you claimed, the murder weapon is not the travel wallet... ...however, it IS something you stole from Mr. Hicks after you were done with the vile deed. I find it hard to believe myself, but your motive was very simple... You were out to steal Mr. Hicks's money, weren't you? Edgeworth: So even though I didn't have the murder weapon on me, you still suspect me, I see... Teneiro: You stood up at the crime scene with the victim's wallet in your hands. How can I turn a blind eye and not suspect you of foul play? Teneiro: As you claimed, the murder weapon is not the travel wallet... Teneiro: ...however, it IS something you stole from Mr. Hicks after you were done with the vile deed. Teneiro: I find it hard to believe myself, but your motive was very simple... Teneiro: You were out to steal Mr. Hicks's money, weren't you? Edgeworth: (She... really is making a fool of herself, pursuing this line of logic. I should spare her and present the piece of evidence that contradicts her testimony.) Teneiro: I...I...I... Forgive meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease! Passenger: Hey! What the heck!? Passenger: Are you saying the attendant's wrong!? Passenger: So that guy isn't the killer!? Passenger: Hah! Don't believe it, everyone! It's a trick! Teneiro: Nnnngh......... Edgeworth: Will you all please be quiet!? Ms. Teneiro. Teneiro: Yes? Edgeworth: You lost your cool when you saw the dead body. Plus, the lounge was dark, and looking into the light from the elevator... ...it's easy to see how you mistook the wallet in my hand for the murder weapon. I take no offense that you thought that I was the killer. Teneiro: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Thank you for releasing me. ???: [Borginese speaking]! Edgeworth: (Wh-What is it now!?) ???: [Borginese speaking]! Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro, if you could please translate, I'd be much obliged. Teneiro: I-It sounds like Borginian... But I... ...I don't understand any of it. There's another attendant on this flight who... ???: I said that he is giving the runabout! Edgeworth: ! ???: I don't require an interpreter! I speak English just well! See! You, the attendant! Teneiro: Y-Yes, sir! ???: I want this person to be under the arrest until we arrive at the airport! Edgeworth: ...... Teneiro: ...... Edgeworth: I'm sorry, sir, but what exactly are you hoping for? ???: What is it you want? I am finished talking to the likes of you. Edgeworth: Please, I would like to hear why you would like me to be held under arrest until we land! ???: You! How dare you try to waste my time!? Edgeworth: (You were the one who stuck your nose into my affairs!) ???: I wanted to spend even at least one more second with my precious art! I have no time for other things! I know what you are! I see through you! Insolvent! Yes, I am pretty sure that's how you say it in English! Edgeworth: (Well, I should hope I'm not monetarily bankrupt (changed from [I'd hope that I don't dissolve in water] in the original release, correcting a mistake where Edgeworth defines insoluble instead of insolvent), but I don't think that's what you meant.) I'm sorry, but I don't think I caught your name. Lablanc: I am Zinc Lablanc II. I am a very wealthy man in the Borginia! But I am not an ordinary rich man! I am an art dealer... a rich seller of beauty! Teneiro: Mr. Lablanc, what did you mean just now? Lablanc: Pardon!? Teneiro: Um, when you said that Mr. Edgeworth was giving me the \"runabout\"? Lablanc: I have to explain!? Unbelievable... I will say it once and only once. I do not have even a second to waste! \"Time is money\" as they say! Edgeworth: (Yes, and yet you continue to blather on...) Lablanc: I saw it, yes I did. I saw the victim go onto the elevator. Going down to the lounge! It was exactly at 6 o'clock! Edgeworth: ...... Teneiro: ...... A-And what's the significance of that time...? Edgeworth: (At 6, he says.........) W-Wait, you saw him at 6!?!? Teneiro: Aaaah! Wh-What's the matter, Mr. Edgeworth!? Lablanc: He understands, I see. Ms. Attendant! What time did you discover the body!? Teneiro: Well, it was a little after that patch of turbulence, so I would say around 6:15... Ah! Lablanc: \"Hicks\" was his name, was it? Then I say that man Hicks was killed in the 15 minute time span. And the only person in the lounge at that time was this prosecutor, yes? Edgeworth: ......... Passenger: Y-Yeah! I-I was in my seat the whole time! Passenger: M-Me, too! I was watching the movie and enjoying a fine glass of grape juice! Passenger: I was still eating! Still haven't finished, see! Lablanc: The other passengers have an alibi, so you have no problem with them, I suppose? Edgeworth: ......... Lablanc: \"No compliant\", I see. Not a single word against this, right!? Edgeworth: ...I have no way of discounting what you have put forth at this point, but it wasn't me. Lablanc: Oh!? So you say! But do you have, what you say, the evidence? Teneiro: Mr. Edgeworth... Are you really the culprit after all...? Edgeworth: Mr. Lablanc. I suppose you are quite certain in what you saw? Enough to give testimony? ......... Lablanc: Of course! I was looking at that man the whole time! He was playing with that annoying little... um... small \"machine\" the whole time! Edgeworth: \"Machine\"...? Lablanc: Yes, that's what you people call it in English, yes? It was making me crazy with the click, click, click! Edgeworth: (From that description, it sounds like some sort of small computer...) Teneiro: I believe what Mr. Lablanc is talking about is a cell phone. I have to say that I did see him playing with it quite a bit, myself. Edgeworth: (A simple cell phone? A laptop or organizer I can see, but... That's kind of... low budget.) Lablanc: I hate that noisy little machine in his hand! Not a fragment of beauty! All it produces is ugly sounds! Anyway, I know what I saw! Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro. Teneiro: Yes? Edgeworth: I was wondering if I might be granted permission to examine the crime scene. Teneiro: What!? You want to... examine the crime scene? Edgeworth: If you would grant me a little measure of time, I'm sure I can produce the real culprit. Lablanc: Hmph. I don't like the sound of that. \"Fox in the duck pen.\" Yes, I think that is how you say it in English. Edgeworth: It's \"Fox guarding the henhouse.\" And I believe my innocence was proven earlier. And if I'm given the chance, I can clear up all the remaining doubts. Teneiro: ......... Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro! If you wait until we arrive... ...there is a good chance that some evidence will have been destroyed by then. Teneiro: ......... ...I understand. Let me see what the captain has to say. Lablanc: Hah! This should not be approved! Teneiro: Please, Mr. Lablanc! In an emergency, all decisions are to be made by the captain alone. Now, please wait here while I go ask the captain what to do. I'll be right back. Lablanc: You are not planning to erase evidence when you are doing your investigation, yes? Edgeworth: Of course not! Lablanc: Hah, we will see! Teneiro: Mr. Edgeworth, you have the captain's permission to investigate the crime scene. Lablanc: Wh-What!? Unbelievable!!! Edgeworth: I am in your debt, Ms. Teneiro. Teneiro: However... there is one condition. I am to supervise you. Can you agree to that? Edgeworth: Of course, I see no problem with that stipulation. It's only natural as I am still a suspect in this case. Lablanc: Grrrrrr... Teneiro: I take full responsibility and will watch Mr. Edgeworth's every move. I hope this is reassurance enough that there will be no foul play. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, shall we proceed? If you should need my help with anything, please feel free to use [X / Y / triangle / T] to talk (changed from [touch the Partner Button] in the original release). Edgeworth: (It's time to head to the scene of the crime... the first floor lounge.) Edgeworth: I want to thank you for your help back there, Ms. Teneiro. Teneiro: It was nothing. You should thank the captain for granting you permission. And just so everything is perfectly clear... I still don't trust you (changed from [trust you to that extent] in the original release). Your standing with me hasn't changed one iota (changed from [I don't want you to think your standing with me has changed] in the original release). Edgeworth: I see. I will bear that in mind. Teneiro: I received an order from the captain earlier. He wanted you to know that... ...we reserve the right to stop your investigation if we feel you are not making progress. And when we do, he asks that you please return to your seat at that time. Edgeworth: (So my time runs out at his and his crew's discretion, does it? I have to find a way to discredit Mr. Lablanc's testimony before time's up!) I understand. By the way, is there any place you can think of where the killer might hide onboard? Teneiro: I don't think so. After every First Class passenger was accounted for at his or her seat... ...we made a thorough search of the plane. As for Business and Economy class... ...no one can move between those two classes and First Class without a staff keycard. And we found no record of a keycard being used at all. Edgeworth: (Which means that I have a First Class Killer on my hands. At least I know that much for sure. And one other thing. No one else has been allowed near this crime scene since the murder was discovered either.) Edgeworth: Now then, let's get started. Teneiro: But where would we start from? Edgeworth: Hmm... Let's start with Mr. Lablanc's statements. The crime occurred between 6 AM and 6:15 AM. During that interval, the only person in the lounge was myself. Which would make me the prime suspect. However, since I did not kill Mr. Hicks, it means that the killer was around somewhere (Where was the killer? \u2013 What clues point to where the killer could have been?)... Teneiro: If we are to believe what you say is true, then yes. Edgeworth: Hmm... The first order of business will be to gather information to win your trust. After connecting all possible Logic and correctly deducing lanyard: Edgeworth: (Hm? What's going on over there?) Lablanc: [Borginese speaking]! [Borginese speaking]! ???: [Borginese speaking]... [Borginese speaking]... Lablanc: Unforgivable! This is unforgivable! ???: ......... Lablanc: Do you understand what I am saying!? The movie is late! It is the same level of bad as if the plane arrived late! ???: Ummmmm... But the movie... Lablanc: What!? I will not talk to you anymore! You are just wasting my time! Teneiro: What is the matter, Mr. Lablanc? If there is no emergency, please return to your seat, sir. Lablanc: Do not tell me what to do! I need not to sit down! Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? Did you prove you are innocent yet!? Edgeworth: If you would like, I will prove my innocence to you right now. Lablanc: What!? Nonsense! Are you saying my eye-witness testimony is mistaken!? Edgeworth: Not mistaken, merely that there is room for doubt. I'd be most honored if you could please tell me what you saw in detail once more. Lablanc: Fine, suit yourself! Lablanc: I am certain I saw Mr. Hicks enter that elevator! It was when the needles on my pocket watch pointed to the 6 and the 12! The body was discovered 15 minutes after that in the lounge, yes? Then you, the only person in the lounge at that time, must be the criminal! Edgeworth: (Mr. Lablanc's conclusions seem to make logical sense. After all, the only person in the lounge at the supposed time of the murder was me...) Lablanc: So! My eye-witness testimony! If you think you can destroy it, then come, let me see! Hurry! Do I look like a man who is having the time to wait for you!? Edgeworth: (Why is HE so irritated? I'm the one accused of murder here! Anyway, I must find a way to discredit Mr. Lablanc's account somehow, and fast!) Lablanc: I am certain I saw Mr. Hicks enter that elevator! Lablanc: The only person inside was that Mr. Hicks man! Lablanc: It was when the needles on my pocket watch pointed to the 6 and the 12! Lablanc: The body was discovered 15 minutes after that in the lounge, yes? Lablanc: Then you, the only person in the lounge at that time, must be the criminal! Edgeworth: Mr. Lablanc. Lablanc: What is it!? Edgeworth: There is a very glaring contradiction in your testimony! Lablanc: What do you mean!? Edgeworth: Please take a look at the area in front of the elevator. There, at the spilled grape juice. Lablanc: Yes, and!? Will you admit you also spilled it with the blood!? Edgeworth: No, it spilled itself during the turbulence. But the interesting thing here is the set of grape juice footprints. Lablanc: F-Footprints!? Edgeworth: Yes, the ones that lead from within the elevator out into the lounge itself. It's evidence that proves that someone other than Mr. Hicks exited the elevator, alive! Lablanc: Ooooooooonnff!! Edgeworth: There must have been another person in the elevator with Mr. Hicks! Now then! I'm done playing games! Why don't you tell us the truth!? Lablanc: [Borginese speaking]! ...[Borginese speaking]! Edgeworth: ............ Teneiro: Can you please translate for us? ???: Ummmmmmmmmmm... \"No way! That's totally impossible!\" I guess is what he said. Lablanc: No way! That is totally impossible! I know there was no other person in there! I saw with my own eyes! Edgeworth: ............ Teneiro: If you want to know what I think, Mr. Edgeworth... ...I don't think Mr. Lablanc is lying to us. Edgeworth: (...I suppose she's right. He doesn't seem to be lying. But then, what does it mean? What about this contradiction?) Mr. Lablanc. Please, just once more, will you recall the details of what you witnessed for me? Lablanc: Mnnnnrgh! Lablanc: I was very upset when Mr. Hicks passed by my seat. I was always checking the time, over and over again. I happened to follow that man with my eyes when he passed me. And I saw clearly into the elevator he was entering. But, I swear there was no one else inside! No one! Teneiro: Mr. Lablanc, if you would please calm down... Lablanc: What!? Dare you too have an issue with my eye-witness testimony!? Teneiro: Aaaaah! N-No, not at all! Please forget I said anything! Edgeworth: (Yet again, he doesn't appear to be lying. But I can't let this testimony stand as the truth!) Lablanc: I was very upset when Mr. Hicks passed by my seat. Lablanc: I was always checking the time, over and over again. Lablanc: The movie I wanted to see would not start, so I checked my pocket watch many times. Lablanc: My watch is set to my destination's time. I always set it when I board the plane. Lablanc: I happened to follow that man with my eyes when he passed me. Lablanc: And I saw clearly into the elevator he was entering. Lablanc: But, I swear there was no one else inside! No one! Edgeworth: Mr. Lablanc, you said this just now in your testimony: Lablanc: I even set my pocket watch to the destination time when I came onboard. Edgeworth: Now, if your watch has been set to our destination's time zone... ...it would mean that your watch is displaying the time of our destination. Lablanc: Yes, and? The correct time is worth its 6 cents. Edgeworth: I would like you to take a look at this. If you believe this Sky Magazine... ...clocks on this flight run in accordance with the time of our departure time zone! Of course, the movie schedule was also created with that in mind. Ms. Teneiro, for confirmation's sake, what time zone is this flight aligned to right now? Teneiro: Well, we made a short stop at a transfer point. Edgeworth: (That's right. It was in that small Asian country, the Republic of Zheng Fa...) Teneiro: But we didn't re-adjust our onboard clocks at that time. So right now, we are still running on Borginian time! Lablanc: What!? Edgeworth: The time difference between Borginia and our destination is 9 hours. In that case, it's only natural that your watch would be out of sync with the schedule! Lablanc: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!? Edgeworth: Further, with your analog watch set to our destination's time... ...it would appear to be running 3 hours fast when compared to the flight's onboard clocks. It also changes everything about your testimony. And you can bet 1 million cents on that! In light of this information, it means you saw Mr. Hicks 3 hours prior at 3 AM! Lablanc: Nnnnn...ggggggwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My 1 miiiiiiiiiiiiiiillion ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeents!!! Edgeworth: (This should clear up all of the remaining accusations...) Teneiro: So this basically widens the time frame for the time of death, right...? Edgeworth: Yes. Because Mr. Lablanc saw the victim enter the elevator at 3 AM... ...it means that the time of death could be anywhere from 3 to 6:15 AM. The question now is where was Mr. Hicks during that span of time and what was he doing? ???: Um, I've got something to say. Edgeworth: And you are...? ???: Yeah, um... Oh! I'm Cammy Meele. I'm a flight attendant. Edgeworth: And what is it you wish to say? Meele: Well, I think your story is a little different from how I remember it. Teneiro: What do you mean, Cammy? Meele: I saw Mr. Hicks sitting in his seat at 5 AM, you know. Edgeworth: What? How can you be so sure of the time? Teneiro: Oh, that's right! He pushed his call button while we were parked at the transfer point. Edgeworth: Ah, the stop we made for refueling and cargo transfer in Zheng Fa, correct? Teneiro: Yes, it was from 4 to 5 AM according to our clocks. Edgeworth: And during that time, did any of the passengers leave or did any new ones board this flight? Teneiro: No. Not a single person got off or on in Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: What about the flight crew? Teneiro: The few who were handling the cargo transfer might have temporarily gotten on or off... ...but eventually everyone, including Cammy and myself, came back on the plane. Edgeworth: (So basically, I can assume that no one left or got on since our initial take off. Interesting... I should keep that in mind.) Refueling in Zheng Fa data jotted down in my Organizer. Meele: Yeah, and I answered his call. I can tell you Mr. Akbey Hicks was there in his seat when we took off again at 5 AM. Ms. Meele's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Alright, then that puts the time of the murder between 5 and 6:15 AM. Meele: OK, now what time did you come down to the lounge, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Hmm, I remember coming down here almost as soon as we left the Republic of Zheng Fa... Aaah! Lablanc: You! You were here the whole time from 5, yes!? Then you are the only one who could be the killer! Teneiro: Mr. Edgeworth... Were you really here in this lounge the entire time from 5 AM onwards? Edgeworth: Unfortunately, yes. Teneiro: But then, how do we explain the footprints? Lablanc: Is not that obvious!? This man waited for Mr. Hicks here in this lounge. Waited to kill him! And then he put the corpse into the elevator! That is when the turbulence happened! My eye-witness testimony may have been mistaken! But what time I saw Mr. Hicks enter the elevator on the second floor does not matter! Because the entire incident concluded here in this lounge! Edgeworth: (Everything happened in this lounge...?) Is that what you really believe, Mr. Lablanc? Lablanc: Wh...!? Do you have another idea!? Edgeworth: I simply feel that there is something out of place in the scenario you presented. (Is there something that can tie this crime to a location other than this lounge?) Edgeworth: The murder weapon... This little piggy bank is sold at the in-flight shop. It is sold there and only there, and is not displayed here in this lounge! How, then, did it find its way here? Don't you find that a tiny bit suspicious? Lablanc: Hmph! Such a trivial point! It only means you prepared it, taking it from the shop first before coming here. It doesn't prove you are innocent at all! Edgeworth: Nnnrrrgh......... (Is there no way to win with this man!?) ???: Teneiro: I-If I may...! Lablanc: What is it!? Teneiro: Um... You see...! Well, it's just as Mr. Edgeworth says! Lablanc: Oh? And why do you know this so well? Teneiro: Well... It's just that... That piggy bank was there in the shop. I saw it with my own eyes. Edgeworth: And when was this? Teneiro: It was... maybe around 5:40 AM...? Edgeworth: ...Isn't that just before we hit that patch of turbulence!? Teneiro: Th-That's right... Lablanc: You were in the shop just before the turbulence!? Teneiro: Um............ Yes, I was. Edgeworth: Come to think of it... Ms. Teneiro, when I found the body... ...I believe you came out of that door. Teneiro: Yes, I did... Edgeworth: And what is beyond that door? Teneiro: That's the flight attendants' room. Lablanc: Th-Then! You were on the first floor!? Teneiro: Yes... I had to do something at the shop and in the flight attendants' room. So I went to the shop first, and then to the flight attendants' room. Edgeworth: Are you saying you passed by me at some point? Teneiro: Yes. You seemed really into the issue of Sky Magazine you were reading at the time. I don't suppose you noticed me walking by... Edgeworth: (Hmm, I vaguely recall someone walking by, but I didn't take notice of who it was.) Teneiro: Anyway! The piggy bank was definitely there at the shop when I went there. Lablanc: Why did you go to the shop in the first place? Teneiro: I... went there for a work-related matter. Lablanc: Work, you say? Teneiro: Yes... The upkeep of the shop is also one of my responsibilities. Lablanc: Why did you not say anything about that until now is what I want to know. Teneiro: ......... Edgeworth: In any case, I believe it's clear that the shop needs to be investigated as well. Teneiro: Shall we head over there, then? ???: Edgeworth: Wh-What is it now!? Meele: Aren't you forgetting something, Ms. Rhoda...? Don't you need the captain's permission to check the shop? Teneiro: No, I haven't forgotten. But I have already asked him for permission to search the entire plane. So I think we're alright. Meele: Huh...? That's weird... Edgeworth: What is? Meele: Well, I just talked to the captain, see... ...and he said that he didn't give you permission to do anything like that at all. Teneiro: ! Edgeworth: What is the meaning of this, Ms. Teneiro!? Meele: It means she's lying. Go on, admit that you are. You said you had permission to search all over, but you don't. And yet, here you are! Teneiro: ......... Lablanc: ...You, flight attendant! Wh-What are you trying to do!? Pull the sheep over us!? Meele: The captain's calling for you, Ms. Rhoda. Oh, but don't worry... I already got permission to search the shop from the captain. See, unlike you, I do things the right way. Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro... Why would you do such a thing? Teneiro: .........Please excuse me. Meele: Looks like I get to be in charge now. Please go back to your seat, Mr. Lablanc. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth... ...if you would follow me, I will be your guide from now on. Edgeworth: (There's something about Ms. Teneiro that has piqued my curiosity. But right now, investigating the in-flight shop is my top priority.) Edgeworth: (So this is the in-flight shop...) It's quite a mess in here... Meele: You think? Guess I'll have to clean things up then, tee hee. Edgeworth: Hold on! You can't \"clean up\" a potential crime scene! Meele: Ohhh, thank goodness! I hate cleaning soooo much. Edgeworth: (I mustn't rush things here. I must remain cool, calm and collected. Because this piggy bank (Murder weapon: Capt. Ugo - The blood on it is still fresh... Could this be the murder weapon?) was left at the crime scene... ...there is a very good chance that the killer had paid this place a visit.) Edgeworth: (Hmm... The hat probably used to be on the piggy bank's head. Let's give it a go and see...) I believe this piggy bank was forcibly removed from this display case. (Does this mean that the killer broke the glass to get at it...?) Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank data updated in my Organizer. Meele: Eeeeeehhhh? Really? Edgeworth: Don't tell me you don't know what things go where in this shop. Meele: Well, I don't! Ms. Rhoda's in charge of this place. So, come on, how should I know anything? Edgeworth: (I sense that further inspection of this display case is needed.) Edgeworth: There is definitely something very unusual about this! Meele: About what? Edgeworth: If the killer had broken the glass to get at the Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) bank... ...there should be shards of glass inside the case itself. Meele: Ooooooh, I see! Yeah, I guess it'd be like that! Edgeworth: However, there's not a single piece of glass inside the display case. Meele: Nope! No, there isn't! Edgeworth: Which means that the glass was broken from the inside out. The piggy bank must've fallen over from the turbulence and right through the glass. Meele: Yeah, that's for sure. There's so much glass all over the floor. Edgeworth: I'm willing to bet that this hat was knocked off its head at that time, too. Meele: .........Eh!? ......That's nice. Edgeworth: Which leads me to believe... ...that the killer took the Captain Ugo bank (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) from here after the turbulence (Turbulence - The plane shook so much during it that it made a huge mess of the shop.)! Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank data updated in my Organizer. Meele: ..................zzz. Edgeworth: Take your power naps on your own time, Ms. Meele, and listen when I'm talking! Meele: Wah! Edgeworth: But the murder occurred before the turbulence... ...which rules this piggy bank out as the murder weapon. Meele: So you mean the bank's not the real murder weapon? It's a fake? Edgeworth: Yes, at this point, that is a very real possibility. Meele: Um, but then what if when the killer went to take Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release)... ...they broke the glass by accident? Edgeworth: The display case is locked, so that's highly unlikely. Meele: ...Yeah, but there's one person who could've. Edgeworth: Oh? And who would that be? Meele: Ms. Rhoda, of course. I mean, she's the one in charge of this place, so she has the keys to everything. Edgeworth: Ms. Rhoda Teneiro, huh... Edgeworth: Yes... There is definitely something wrong here! Meele: W-What's with the sudden yelling!? Edgeworth: Tell me, Ms. Meele, don't you think there's something strange about these suitcases? Meele: Oh, well, sure... They totally ooze \"strange\". Like the color and the such... Edgeworth: That's not what I'm talking about! Now pay attention! Meele: Aaah! You're scaring me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: S-Sorry... Ahem. These suitcases are lined up a bit too prim and proper. Meele: Yeah, they look a bit uptight, don't they? But I guess they take after their creator, hee hee. Edgeworth: Again, that's not what I meant, Ms. Meele. Don't you find it unusual that these cases are the only things undisturbed by the turbulence? (...Never mind. I'd sooner find an answer by inspecting these suitcases myself.) Upon closer inspection, they really are quite hideous. Meele: Tee hee... I wonder how Ms. Rhoda would've reacted if she'd heard what you just said. Edgeworth: ......... Meele: What's wrong? Edgeworth: (...She makes a good point. It would be wise of me to watch what I say out loud.) What's this? I've spotted something that's not quite right... (What is so unusual about this suitcase?) Edgeworth: There's something very peculiar about these wheels. Meele: Huh? As in? Edgeworth: As in... ...there are no stoppers in place on these. Without stoppers, one would think that the turbulence would have sent it flying. Meele: ...And? Edgeworth: *sigh* And so, it is very likely that this suitcase was placed here after we hit that turbulence! Let's take a closer look at it, shall we? Leads to examination of suitcase Edgeworth: Hmm, it would appear to be unlocked. Let's take a look at what's inside. A piece of cloth... ...And it's soaked with blood! Meele: Aaaaah! It's... It's blood! Edgeworth: It appears that this suitcase... ...is very strongly tied to our murder after all! Meele: So explain this to me...? What does this suitcase have to do with the murder? Edgeworth: I believe it's pretty safe to say that the killer used this suitcase in some manner. Such as to move something perhaps? Meele: Ehhhh... But aren't you just talking about the cloth then? Edgeworth: That alone is too small. A larger item would be needed to move what I'm thinking of. The \"thing\" I believe the killer used this suitcase to transport is... Edgeworth: Something that would fit inside a suitcase that is also covered in blood... Sounds like a dead body, doesn't it? GoYou (changed from [iFly] in the original release) Suitcase data jotted down in my Organizer. Bloody Cloth data jotted down in my Organizer. Meele: But... But... Edgeworth: In light of this, I'd say that Mr. Hicks was moved into the elevator from someplace else. Which means that the murder was committed in an entirely different location! Meele: ......... So you're saying that after moving the body into the elevator... ...the killer brought the suitcase in here and just left it? Edgeworth: Exactly. Meele: ......... Edgeworth: What is it? Meele: Um, nothing... Just that... ...I was thinking about what Ms. Rhoda said about coming here for something... Edgeworth: ! ???: Excuse me, Mr. Edgeworth... Teneiro: I wanted to give you a bit more time... ...but I'm afraid I wasn't able to convince the captain. I'm very sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. but the captain feels that he has allowed you ample time. He says that he'd appreciate it if you could wrap it up here and return to your seat. Edgeworth: I understand his sentiments, however, if I'm not allowed to complete my investigation... ...the crime scene may become contaminated by the time we land. If I must stop, then I insist I be allowed to oversee the preservation of the two sites. ...Under your supervision, of course. Teneiro: If that's your only condition, then I believe we can accommodate your wishes. I'm here to assist you in any way that I can, Mr. Edgeworth. Meele: Sounds like fun! We can camp out and watch over everything together! Edgeworth: (I've found proof that the real crime scene was not in the lounge... ...and I have enough evidence to prove myself to be innocent of any wrongdoing... And yet... Regarding what Ms. Meele reminded me about Ms. Teneiro... I can't allow my investigation to end here! The truth must come to light!) To be continued Edgeworth: (I know that once we had landed... ...I'm supposed to let the local police take over... And thanks to Ms. Teneiro and Ms. Meele, I was able to preserve the crime scene... But I just can't shake it. I wasn't able to talk with Ms. Teneiro in private... ...so I'm left wondering just what was she up to? Why did she do what she did? There must be a way for me to continue my investigation.) ???: I've been expecting you, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Franziska? I thought you were still in Germany... Franziska: I go where I am needed. And wherever there are criminals to be caught. Edgeworth: (Her name is Franziska von Karma. The daughter of my mentor, Manfred von Karma, she, like myself, is a prosecutor.) Are you heading up this case? It would be a bit of a relief if you are... Franziska: Don't you try to flatter me! Miles Edgeworth... I'm placing you under arrest. Edgeworth: Wh... What!? Franziska: It's quite frustrating, actually. I had hoped to exact my revenge on you in a different venue... ...but I'll have to take what I can get. I never thought I'd see the day... ...when a disciple of the house of Von Karma would become a criminal! Have you no shame!? Edgeworth: Wait! It has all been a big misunderstanding! I didn't kill the victim! Franziska: A misunderstanding!? I heard all about the murder over the police radio from the captain himself. You waited for the victim on the first floor, and then beat him to death. Edgeworth: Franziska, do you honestly believe that I killed a man? Franziska: .................. I suppose I should reserve judgement until after I have investigated this for myself. I can put your arrest on hold until then. Edgeworth: That's as it should be. Franziska: Hah! I don't need a lecture on how to perform my duties from you of all people. \"To be perfect in every way.\" The fulfillment of that creed alone is all I strive for! Edgeworth: Well, I have my own creed which I must fulfill, so why don't we solve this together? Franziska: ...I have to get going. The crime scene awaits. Don't you dare leave town. Edgeworth: Trust me, I had no intention to. Franziska: Detective Gumshoe! ???: Yes, sir! Franziska: Too slow! Gumshoe: Owww! Franziska: Listen up. I'm leaving you in charge of watching this man. Don't mess up, understand!? Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth!? I'm supposed to guard him!? Franziska: A simple yes or no, Detective! Gumshoe: Ack! Yes, sir! Understood, sir! You just leave it to me! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. If you interfere with my investigation, I'll arrest you on the spot. Are we clear? Now then, if you'll excuse me. Gumshoe: Good to see you again, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Boy am I glad to see you're OK! Edgeworth: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: I believe in you, sir! You can lean on me! I'll get you through this! Edgeworth: (I have to admit I'm a bit curious as to what Franziska is up to. Maybe I should ask the good detective...) Very well. In that case, I have a few questions for you. After clearing all Talk options with Dick Gumshoe: Gumshoe: Anyway, that's about all the info I have, sir. We should find out more as we investigate. Edgeworth: (Yes, it is high time to resume my investigation. Starting with talking to the people involved in this case afresh.) Franziska: So you must be the captain. Captain: Why, yes, I am! And who might you be? Franziska: I am the Prodigy Prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, and I have a few questions for you. Meele: Ahhh, don't you dare, Captain! Getting friendly with another woman... I'll never forgive you if you do! Captain: Wh-What are you talking about? I-I only have eyes for you, my dear Cammy! Edgeworth: (I wouldn't bet money on our dear captain to be much of a reputable person.) Gumshoe: Sure you don't want to ask the captain some questions, sir? Edgeworth: He was in the cockpit the entire time. I highly doubt he would know anything of use. Anyway, I like to leave that type of witness to Franziska and her whip. Captain: Aaaaaaaaah!!! ???: Now see here!!! Gumshoe: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack! Sorry, sorry, sorry! I'm SOOOOOOOOOORRY!! Lablanc: How long do you intend to hold me!? It is impossible for me to be the criminal! I told you! Edgeworth: Mr. Lablanc... Lablanc: Oh, it is you! Tell this man to stop stopping me from going! Time is money! I don't have even one second of wasteful time to spend! Edgeworth: What did you mean by \"that attendant\", Mr. Lablanc? Lablanc: She was taken into the attendants' room for her interview. And then they still have not come out! They make no sign of coming out either! I was finished with my own interview much earlier, quicker than her! Edgeworth: (Why is Ms. Teneiro's interview the only one that's taking up so much time...?) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. You were given free reign [sic] to examine the plane, weren't you? Edgeworth: Yes, I was able to obtain the cooperation of the flight attendants. Speaking of attendants, I'd like to speak with Ms. Teneiro. I wonder if you might grant me permission to enter the flight attendants' room? Franziska: Hmph. Before I do... ...you still have to clear up a few issues surrounding your own circumstances. Edgeworth: ...I understand. Franziska: You may have tricked those attendants with your sophisticated talking... ...but you can't pull the wool over my eyes, Miles Edgeworth. Franziska: Let's not complicate things and go with the most obvious conclusion. The scene of the crime was here, in the very lounge the body was discovered. From the time the victim was seen calling for an attendant until his body was found... ...the only person in this lounge the entire time was you, Miles Edgeworth! This, unmistakably, makes you the likeliest suspect. Edgeworth: Hmph. The \"likeliest suspect\", Franziska? Franziska: Do you have a problem with that? Edgeworth: No, but it's not like you to use such vague wording. You're usually a bit more... absolute. Franziska: I'm simply trying to watch out for you. Or is my kindness too hard for you to comprehend? Edgeworth: Thank you, but your leniency is unnecessary, for I will prove my innocence soon enough! (If I want to continue my investigation, I'll have to break her line of logic, fast!) Franziska: Let's not complicate things and go with the most obvious conclusion. Franziska: The scene of the crime was here, in the very lounge the body was discovered. Franziska: From the time the victim was seen calling for an attendant until his body was found... Franziska: ...the only person in this lounge the entire time was you, Miles Edgeworth! Franziska: This, unmistakably, makes you the likeliest suspect. Edgeworth: (The likeliest suspect, huh. What a roundabout euphemism. But it would appear that she doesn't yet know... ...about the new evidence that we acquired, and where we acquired it. I'll take care of the gaps in her logic one hole at a time.) Edgeworth: It would appear that you did not have all the information you needed after all. Franziska: And what does that mean? Edgeworth: I found a nice piece of evidence just before I was forced to stop investigating. A piece that proves that the body was moved from a different location! Franziska: ......... Edgeworth: The killer used this suitcase to move the victim's body. Meaning that the real scene of the crime is not this lounge at all! Franziska: Franziska: Now who's the one rashly jumping to conclusions? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Franziska: All you did was find this piece of cloth inside the suitcase. That doesn't prove that the body was moved. It could be that the killer simply chose that suitcase as a good place to hide the cloth. Edgeworth: I expected you would come to that conclusion. It would seem I can't escape that easily. Franziska: You should know better than that. A Von Karma is perfect in every way. Edgeworth: Ah, but did you know that the killer definitely wheeled the suitcase around at some point? Franziska: Franziska: As if there is proof of that! Edgeworth: (Where is the proof that this suitcase was moved around?) Franziska: The spilled grape juice in front of the elevator... Edgeworth: Yes, and I'd like to draw your attention to this area here... (Where is the evidence that proves the killer dragged the suitcase through here?) Edgeworth: This mark here... Wouldn't you say that it looks suspiciously like tracks from two wheels? Franziska: I suppose. Edgeworth: Further, there is also grape juice residue on the wheels of the suitcase. This means that the suitcase containing the victim's body definitely passed through here. Franziska: .........I suppose this means that the killer... ...did move the victim's body from somewhere else. Edgeworth: I'm glad you've come to your senses. Franziska: Franziska: Not so fast! This still doesn't put you in the clear! Not by a long shot! Franziska: You prepared yourself and acquired the piggy bank before the plane hit that turbulence. And then, you waited for the victim in the lounge, where you beat him to death. Then, while you were in the elevator with the victim's body stuffed into the suitcase... ...the plane hit that patch of turbulence, and out flew the body from within the suitcase! With no way out, you hastily put the suitcase back where you had taken it from... ...and pretended to be the \"discoverer\" of the body. Edgeworth: Not a bad bit of logic, for something you thought of on the fly. Franziska: Just what are you insinuating? Edgeworth: That I will show you exactly how flawed your logic is. (No matter how strong of a face you put on, not even you can hide your fears from me. I'll expose the flaws in her logic in one fell swoop!) Franziska: You prepared yourself and acquired the piggy bank before the plane hit that turbulence. Franziska: And then, you waited for the victim in the lounge, where you beat him to death. Franziska: Then, while you were in the elevator with the victim's body stuffed into the suitcase... Franziska: ...the plane hit that patch of turbulence, and out flew the body from within the suitcase! Franziska: With no way out, you hastily put the suitcase back where you had taken it from... Franziska: ...and pretended to be the \"discoverer\" of the body. Edgeworth: (Her logic is reasonably sound... ...and the large majority of it reflects the truth... ...but there is one point about it that is not quite right.) Edgeworth: The fact that you took this piece of evidence into account in your testimony... ...is to be commended. Your legal prowess is certainly something to be feared. Franziska: Evidence and logic. Essential tools that those who would stand in a courtroom must learn to master. Edgeworth: But what if there was a fake piece of evidence thrown into the mix? Franziska: A fake...? Edgeworth: This Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) piggy bank... is just such a fake! It is NOT the real murder weapon! Franziska: WHAT!? Edgeworth: The timing of when the bank was taken from the shop is important. And it was taken after the turbulence had occurred. Franziska: But then, what about the blood on the bank!? What do you make of that!? Edgeworth: I assume it was added after the murder when the killer fabricated this weapon. Looking at it this way, the killer basically did three things after the turbulence. After exiting the elevator... ...the killer brought the suitcase to the shop and left it there. Then, the killer proceeded to pick the bank up from off the floor... ...and took it to fabricate a fake murder weapon by hitting the victim on the head. Finally, the victim's wallet was planted on my personage, in my pocket to be precise. Everything was done so that I would be framed for the murder of Mr. Akbey Hicks! Franziska: You there! Officer: Yes, ma'am! Franziska: Other than this piggy bank, was anything else resembling a murder weapon found? Officer: We didn't find anything in this lounge or in the shop that could be used as one, ma'am! Most of the items that could have been used were broken during the turbulence. And the remaining items all tested negative for any trace of blood! Franziska: ........I see. Well, Miles Edgeworth, it appears your stall tactics are at an end. Gumshoe: But it's possible that it's just hidden somewhere, sir! Eeeeeeeek! Franziska: If the criminal had wanted to hide the weapon in a safer place... ...I'd think the weapon would have been hidden in the same place as the bloody cloth. Edgeworth: Exactly what I was thinking. Because the cloth was hidden inside that suitcase, it signals to me that the killer... ...had not prepared a more secure place to hide the evidence. Which means that the real murder weapon is either still on the murderer's personage... ...or is still at the real crime scene. Franziska: Franziska: There is one more possibility. Edgeworth: And that would be? Franziska: That the piggy bank is in fact the real weapon. Edgeworth: But didn't we just... Franziska: Franziska: Let me finish! The killer took the bank out from the display case before the turbulence... ...by opening the lock on the display case door. And it was at that time that the glass pane in the door was broken. I'd say that's a perfectly reasonable line of reasoning, wouldn't you? Let's see... so that means that the killer had the key to the display case... Edgeworth: Franziska... The person you're talking about... Franziska: Not so fast, I'm not finished! The person I'm talking about also committed another sin. She tricked the captain... ...and granted you permission to conduct your investigation. Yes, it is the sin of lying! Edgeworth: ...! Franziska: Speaking of which, I recall that you also wished to speak with her. Edgeworth: Yes. Franziska: Very well, permission granted. But only if I can sit in on your interrogation. Do we understand each other? Edgeworth: I have no intention of interrogating her. But you are welcome to accompany me if you so wish. Franziska: Ms. Teneiro is in the flight attendants' room. Let's move. First Class Franziska: So you're the one that poked around inside this plane without the captain's permission! Teneiro: ......... Franziska: Deviating from the flight attendant's manual is very unbecoming, you know. What were you hoping to accomplish by doing that? Teneiro: ...I... I... Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro... Teneiro: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! You're here, too!? Edgeworth: Can you please help us and shed some light on why you did what you did? Teneiro: ......Alright. Edgeworth: So you're saying, Ms. Teneiro, that the suitcase in question was the last one? Teneiro: Yes. They're just so popular, they're practically flying off the shelves! Edgeworth: (That's not exactly the impression I got...) Teneiro: The one in the shop is most definitely the last one! Edgeworth: Well, we're currently looking at that suitcase. Teneiro: Really!? Then I guess we sold all of them! Thank you very much for taking the last one! Edgeworth: I didn't say anything about buying it! Teneiro: Then say you'll buy it! Edgeworth: I... I'm sorry, I can't. Teneiro: B...But why!? I think it'd go great with your complexion, Mr. Edgeworth! It really suits you! I guarantee it personally as a service professional! Edgeworth: Um... Well... That is... How should I put this... ...It's hideous. Teneiro: Wh...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? Edgeworth: (Hmm... Maybe that was a bit too direct.) Moving on... My issue with the suitcases isn't the design, it's the number of them remaining. Teneiro: R-Remaining...!? Edgeworth: There were two suitcases in the in-flight shop when I investigated it. Teneiro: Two...? But that's... impossible! I'm sure there was only one... Franziska: Looks like her story has generated quite the contradiction. Teneiro: When I left the shop... ...I'm positive there was only one suitcase left! Edgeworth: (Something is amiss here. What could be the meaning of this inconsistency? Hm?) By the way, Ms. Teneiro... What is one of those suitcases doing here? Teneiro: Um... That's... Edgeworth: I thought you said there was only one left...? Teneiro: Th-That one is, um... It's mine. I've used it for a very long time now. Edgeworth: (She's used it for a long time...? I think not.) Ms. Teneiro, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't lie to me. Teneiro: Excuse me!? Edgeworth: I don't believe for even one second that you've used this \"for a very long time\"! (What proves that this hasn't been used for nearly as long as Ms. Teneiro says?) Edgeworth: Tell me, Ms. Teneiro, is it also your habit to keep the price tag pristine on your suitcase? Teneiro: Ah! Franziska: What is the meaning of this!? Why would you lie about a suitcase? Teneiro: ............ Edgeworth: (Despite having faith in her design sense... ...the sales numbers made her cry bitter tears. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me.) Ms. Teneiro, I think I understand. I know what you are trying to hide. Now then, this suitcase was originally in... Edgeworth: Seeing as how the price tag is still on this suitcase... ...one can only assume it was out on the floor for sale in the shop. And the person who bought this suitcase was... Edgeworth: It was you, wasn't it, Ms. Teneiro? I hate to say this, but this suitcase that you designed... ...it hasn't sold very well, has it? Teneiro: ......... Edgeworth: You saw how poorly this design that you poured your heart into was selling... ...and were deeply hurt. That's why you wanted to make it look like it was selling by buying it yourself. Isn't that right? Franziska: Then... the reason you went to the shop and came back here was... Teneiro: I-I'm sorry! A-All I really have is my job... I... I was overjoyed when my design was chosen... I thought that maybe... maybe I had finally accomplished something... Edgeworth: But the suitcases didn't sell. Teneiro: It's because of the design, isn't it? All because it's as you put it, \"hideous\". Edgeworth: (I can't say they chose a great place in which to sell them, either...) Teneiro: We weren't selling a single one, and they were just sitting there collecting dust. I felt so bad seeing them there, day in and day out. So I decided to buy one for every flight I worked. Edgeworth: You buy one every single time you work a flight!? Franziska: I see. So in order to keep your resolution, you went and bought one today as well. Teneiro: Yes. And here is my receipt for that purchase. Edgeworth: (Hmm... This receipt is clearly time stamped 5:40 AM.) Suitcase Receipt data jotted down in my Organizer. Teneiro: The truth is, there's still a bunch of them left unsold. They're planning to scrap the remaining ones at the end of this flight. Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro, where are these other suitcases? Teneiro: They should all be down in the cargo hold. Franziska: Then the suitcase the killer used... Edgeworth: ...Could very well have come from the cargo hold. Teneiro: Um, Mr. Edgeworth... You don't think that the killer used one of my suitcases to... Edgeworth: Yes, I do. The killer used one of your beloved suitcases... ...to move the victim's body. Teneiro: Aaaaah! How could they!? Those suitcases were meant to be faithful partners to our passengers on their trips. That's all I ever wished for them to be! Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro, is there any other way to get to the cargo hold other than the elevator? Teneiro: The only other way is just through that door there. Edgeworth: And what about security? Teneiro: That door has no special lock installed, because... ...just to enter this room... ...you need a special keycard that only crew members have access to. Edgeworth: Which means that the culprit is someone who can enter this room... ...eliminating the passengers, and leaving only crew members as potential suspects. Teneiro: I-I can't believe it... ???: Edgeworth: Yes, Franziska? Franziska: Going on these wild goose-chases... You're a disgrace to the Von Karma name! Edgeworth: And what do you mean by that? Franziska: The suitcase came from the cargo hold. That fact alone tells the whole story. Edgeworth: Yes, which is why I said the culprit must be a crew member who used their keycard... Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! You're proposing that the killer rode the elevator from the cargo hold, correct? Edgeworth: Yes, that's the only realistic possibility. Franziska: That other attendant... Ms. Meele... I asked her earlier, and she had this to say. Edgeworth: (Franziska got information out of Ms. Meele?) Franziska: In order to make the elevator go down to the cargo hold... ...a different keycard is required. Edgeworth: A different one? Franziska: Yes, and the only person who holds that particular card... ...is you, Ms. Rhoda Teneiro, and only you! Teneiro: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: What!? Is this true, Ms. Teneiro!? Teneiro: Y-Yes... I keep that keycard in my locker at all times. Edgeworth: Could you please show us that card right now? Teneiro: Y-Yes, hold on... Aaaaah! I... I don't believe it! Edgeworth: What's wrong? Teneiro: The keycard... It's... It's gone! Franziska: Ha ha ha. Very clever. Pretending that your card was stolen, when in fact, you're just trying to hide it from us... You've really thought this through. Teneiro: W-Wait! I-It's not like that! Franziska: You can tell us all about what it's like down at the station. Officer! Arrest this woman! Officer: Yes, ma'am! Teneiro: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ............ Franziska: What's wrong? There's disbelief written all over your face. Edgeworth: Franziska, I know that you are the lead investigator on this case, however... Franziska: Hold it! Don't even think about wasting any more of my time. Edgeworth: ! Franziska: You know the rules as well as I do. Evidence speaks louder than words. Even if this isn't a courtroom, that basic tenet still applies. Edgeworth: ............ Franziska: I intend to investigate the cargo hold now. What will you do, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...I intend to do likewise. To be continued \nFranziska: If it was [sic] a crew member, any one of them could've shown Agent Hicks to the cargo hold. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That might be true, but then, it could be anyone, including Ms. Meele or even the captain. Franziska: Don't be a fool! A plane without a pilot in the cockpit is like... ...a horse without a rider, crop in hand! Much like Scruffy over there! Gumshoe: H-Heeeeeeeeeigh! Edgeworth: (I can't disagree with her on that. Detective Gumshoe does always need a guiding hand.) Very well, then what about the other flight attendant, Ms. Meele? Franziska: Hah, I thought you might ask about her. Franziska: But the point to keep in mind is the keycard that allows the elevator to come down here. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But it's highly likely that the keycard was stolen from Ms. Teneiro! Franziska: Franziska: \"It's highly likely\"...? Is that \"possibility\" the best you can come up with? And you call yourself a disciple of my father! Edgeworth: Nnnrgh! Yes, well... While I don't have any evidence, I... Franziska: Be quiet! You're a disgrace! There's more evidence pointing to Ms. Rhoda Teneiro, you know! It's not just the keycard that gives her away! Edgeworth: Are you talking about the murder weapon, the Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) piggy bank? Franziska: Yes! She is also the only person with a key to open that display case! Edgeworth: ............ Adds statement \"Further, there is the matter of the key to the display case that held the murderous bank.\" Franziska: Further, there is the matter of the key to the display case that held the murderous bank. Press Edgeworth: Leads to: \"But that is a fake...\" Franziska: The only person with such high-level access is Ms. Rhoda Teneiro! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why would such important things, like the keycard, be entrusted to only one person? Franziska: According to Cammy Meele, Rhoda Teneiro is in charge of most of the \"important stuff\". Edgeworth: Then what exactly is Ms. Meele in charge of? Franziska: Chatting it up with that foolish captain, apparently. She was being so foolishly foolish that I didn't want to ask what her other duties were! Edgeworth: Gah! I understand how you feel, but whipping me just now was uncalled for! Franziska: In the end, the only one who could've let Agent Hicks into the hold was Rhoda Teneiro. Franziska: I'd say that's a pretty decisive piece of information, wouldn't you? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Decisive...? Do you really think it's that strong? Franziska: Franziska: There is no room for doubt! All of the other evidence points to her as well! Edgeworth: Hmm......... Franziska: No snappy comeback? That's as it should be. Edgeworth: (Tch... There's not a single flaw in Franziska's reasoning. However, there must be something I can work with that I can draw out of her.) Edgeworth: But that is a fake... Franziska: Franziska: Stop right there, Miles Edgeworth! You don't have any proof that this is just a red herring! If you must keep on insisting that it's a fake... ...then what is the real murder weapon and where did it go? Edgeworth: ......... Franziska: Speechless, I see. That's not a surprise. After all, you know that we've searched the entire cargo hold and came up empty-handed! Edgeworth: (There must be a way... There must be something that can help me rule out the piggy bank as the murder weapon... What should be examined further to help us ascertain the authenticity of the weapon?) Piggy bank Edgeworth: We should examine the bank itself once more to determine if it is the real murder weapon. If this is the real weapon, it should be damaged or perhaps have a dent on it somewhere. Franziska: We've looked into that already and there is no sign of anything on it. But we can't discount it as the murder weapon on that one fact alone. The piggy bank is, after all, made of a stronger material than human flesh. Edgeworth: Nnngh... (If I can't prove it through the piggy bank itself, then I must find another way!) Leads back to: \"What should be examined further to help us ascertain the authenticity of the weapon?\" Crime scene Edgeworth: I think we should examine the crime scene in more detail. We might turn up the murder weapon if we search all of the cargo and luggage. Franziska: Did you think I hadn't thought of that? Even now, we're searching through them. But we haven't found anything that even closely resembles a murder weapon. Edgeworth: Tsk... Alright then. I suppose we should examine something else. Leads back to: \"What should be examined further to help us ascertain the authenticity of the weapon?\" The body Leads to: \"Franziska, I think you were too quick to jump to your conclusions.\" Edgeworth: Franziska, I think you were too quick to jump to your conclusions. Franziska: Oh, was I!? Edgeworth: Yes. We don't even have the autopsy results yet. How can I not say that you made a snap judgment when you have yet to even see... ...if the wound on Agent Hicks's head is consistent with the \"murder weapon\"? Franziska: ......... Scruffy! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Franziska: Contact the medical examiner's office at once! I wish to hear the results of Agent Hicks's autopsy! Gumshoe: Eeeek! Yes, siiiiiir!!! Gumshoe: W-We've got a big problem, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Edgeworth: What is it, Detective!? Gumshoe: They're still doing the autopsy, but they said that they already know this one thing for sure! Franziska: Report! Now! Gumshoe: The doc said that it's one giant bruise from a beating from his shoulder down to his mid-back! Edgeworth: From the victim's shoulder to his mid-back? He was beaten over such a wide area? Gumshoe: Well, I'd say maybe it's a sign the killer had a grudge against Agent Hicks! It wasn't just his head; the killer went all out and hit him multiple times, sir! Autopsy Report data jotted down in my Organizer. Franziska: Scruffy! What is \"had a grudge against Agent Hicks\" supposed to mean!? Gumshoe: I... Well, that's... Um... Edgeworth: Was the wound on the victim's head consistent with the murder weapon, Detective? Gumshoe: Oh, well, they said they were still looking into that, sir! Franziska: ............You're completely useless! Gumshoe: Yeeeeeooooooooowwwww!! Officer: Sir, I told you already! You can't go down there! ???: No, you remove yourself from my way! Edgeworth: What is all that racket? Lablanc: My luggage! My cargo! They're mine, and I demand you return them to me! Officer: We're still investigating the cargo hold! Please understand and have a little patience! Lablanc: ...I suppose there is no choice... Officer: Finally... I think he gav... Hey! What are you...!? Lablanc: You have left me no choice but to use strong force! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr!! Officer: Y-You won't get past me! Edgeworth: (This is...! Wait, that's it! So that's what this whole thing has been about!) Franziska: Further, there is the matter of the key to the display case that held the murderous bank (Capt. Ugo piggy bank - Is there some way for me to prove that this isn't the real murder weapon?). Franziska: After all, you know that we've searched the entire cargo hold and came up empty-handed (Weapon couldn't be found - Nobody could find anything that could be considered the real weapon in the hold.)! Gumshoe: The doc said that it's one giant bruise from a beating from his shoulder down to his mid-back (Cause of death - Extensive bruising from back of head down to mid-back, as if severely beaten.)! Connect \"Capt. Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) piggy bank\" and \"Cause of death\" Logic Leads to: \"Allegedly, the killer struck the victim many times over...\" Edgeworth: (Allegedly, the killer struck the victim many times over... ...which is why there is extensive bruising over such a wide area. ...But is that really the correct conclusion to draw from the evidence? The bruise from his shoulder to the middle of his back is one continuous mark... ...which is more suggestive of a single blow to the back. If that's the case, then the piggy bank (changed from [back] in the original release, correcting the typo) is much too small to have caused that. Therefore, the murder weapon must be something far bigger (A sizable weapon - The unusually large area of bruising suggests that a very large weapon was used!)!) Connect \"Weapon couldn't be found\" and \"A sizable weapon\" Logic Leads to: \"If we're looking for a rather large weapon, you'd think it would stick out...\" Edgeworth: (If we're looking for a rather large weapon, you'd think it would stick out... But so far, we haven't found anything that resembles a weapon of any sort. Perhaps... Just perhaps, it's something we all overlooked from the very beginning. ...because normally, it's too impossibly big to be taken into consideration!) Gumshoe: Wh-What was that all about!? Was he trying to jump his way down here!? Edgeworth: Franziska! Franziska: Wh-What!? What do you want!? Edgeworth: I found it, Franziska... I found the real murder weapon! Franziska: Y-You did!? Gumshoe: He... He really jumped! Edgeworth: We didn't realize it until now, but... ...the answer has been right in front of us this whole time! Gumshoe: He might be hurt! We should go check up on him, sirs! Franziska: There's that pompous attitude of yours again. You should learn to drop that habit. Edgeworth: (This coming from a prosecutor with a habit of whipping everyone she comes across...) Franziska: Anyway, if you really are a prosecutor, then you'll back yourself up with evidence! Gumshoe: ...You two aren't listening at all, are you...? Franziska: Come on then, show me this \"real murder weapon\" you speak of! Show evidence Edgeworth: This is the real murder weapon! Present Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As we have thought all along, the real murder weapon is probably this piggy bank. Franziska: How easily you flip-flop on your own opinions. Perhaps you should flip-flop with Scruffy there and trade jobs. I'm sure he'd like that. Edgeworth: ......You must be joking! (I can't believe I showed her the fake murder weapon! I need to think about the circumstances of the victim's death in a different way. There's a wide bruise running from the victim's shoulder down to his mid-back. Maybe I should be focusing on what could cause such a large bruise in one strike...?) Leads back to: \"Come on then, show me this 'real murder weapon' you speak of!\" Present GoYou (changed from [iFly] in the original release) Suitcase Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The real weapon is... this suitcase. Franziska: When you say it with such confidence, I suppose you must have some evidence...? Edgeworth: Of course. Agent Hicks was placed into this suitcase alive. And it was while he was in here that he was beaten in the head and ba...aaackngh! Franziska: I wonder if you would die if I whipped you from head to toe right now? Edgeworth: (What are you thinking, woman!? Of course I would! I need to think about the circumstances of the victim's death in a different way. There's a wide bruise running from the victim's shoulder down to his mid-back. Maybe I should be focusing on what could cause such a large bruise in one strike...?) Leads back to: \"Come on then, show me this 'real murder weapon' you speak of!\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I have concluded... that this is the real weapon, I suppose. Franziska: Wh-What is that supposed to mean, you fool!? Edgeworth: That... was practice just now for when I would show you the real murder weapon. Franziska: Why don't we add \"practice whippings\" to your routine as well? Edgeworth: Aaaaaaargnnn! (I need to think about the circumstances of the victim's death in a different way. There's a wide bruise running from the victim's shoulder down to his mid-back. Maybe I should be focusing on what could cause such a large bruise in one strike...?) Leads back to: \"Come on then, show me this 'real murder weapon' you speak of!\" Don't have evidence to show Leads to: \"Hmph. I don't have any evidence to show you.\" Edgeworth: Hmph. I don't have any evidence to show you. Franziska: Foolish reasoning for a foolish fool from a foolishly foolish fool meant to fool me... What do you mean by \"I don't have any evidence to show\"!? Edgeworth: Perhaps I should've phrased it as \"that which caused Agent Hicks's death is incorporeal\". Forgive me, but I do believe I have figured out what was the real cause of death! Suffocation Edgeworth: The victim suffered from a lack of oxygen in the elevator and suffocated! Franziska: .................. Edgeworth: A-And... ...the bruising on his back and his broken neck was caused by his sudden fall to the ground. Franziska: .................. Edgeworth: .................. Franziska: ...You are like a fly buzzing in my ear. Be gone! Edgeworth: Aaaaargn! Gumshoe: Aw, that wasn't such a bad guess, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Without a shred of proof, did he just accuse me of making a good \"guess\"...!? Wait... But he did imply I was on the right track...) Leads back to: \"Forgive me, but I do believe I have figured out what was the real cause of death!\" Free fall Leads to: \"The victim fell from a great height and subsequently died as a result.\" Strangulation Edgeworth: The victim was strangled to death inside the elevator! But there are no marks on his neck because... the killer found a way to hide them somehow. A-And... ...the bruising on his back and his broken neck was caused by his sudden fall to the ground. Franziska: Care to explain how the killer magically erased strangulation marks from around his neck!? Edgeworth: .................. Franziska: .................. In that case, please allow me to demonstrate. Edgeworth: That's going to leave a mark! Gumshoe: Aw, that wasn't such a bad guess, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Without a shred of proof, did he just accuse me of making a good \"guess\"...!? Wait... But he did imply I was on the right track...) Leads back to: \"Forgive me, but I do believe I have figured out what was the real cause of death!\" Edgeworth: The victim fell from a great height and subsequently died as a result. In other words, the real cause of death is free-falling to the ground! Gumshoe: He f...f... Franziska: ...Fell to his death!? Edgeworth: (Yes... This is the only plausible possibility!) The victim has extensive bruising on the back of his head and his back. And the only rational explanation for these injuries is that he fell to his death! Franziska: B-But the murder happened inside this plane! Edgeworth: I know. Franziska: Are you claiming that there is someplace in this plane from which he could've fallen from!? Edgeworth: As I said earlier, the answer has been right in front of us the entire time! Franziska: You... You can't mean!? Edgeworth: Yes, I do. The victim fell from the top of the stairs of this very cargo hold! Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaaat!? Then... Then... W-We're in trouble! We may have a second death on our hands, sirs! Hey, you! Tell me you aren't dead, pal! Lablanc: Quiet! Why are you screaming!? Gumshoe: ! He's alive! Franziska: And there you have it, Miles Edgeworth! It's not possible that Agent Hicks fell over the railing to his death. That man is living proof of that. Edgeworth: .........I suppose it's true that it's not possible... given the current circumstances. Franziska: The \"current\" circumstances? What is that supposed to mean!? Edgeworth: Suppose that large piece of cargo wasn't there at the time. What would've happened then? Gumshoe: He would've been a Borginian pancake for sure, sir! Franziska: I suppose that man over there wouldn't still be breathing... But the reality is that the cargo box is there! So there is no point in entertaining your wild hypothetical scenarios! Edgeworth: It may be there now... but there is no proof that it was always there! Franziska: Hah! As if there could've been a window of time when that giant box was not there! Edgeworth: Ah, but there was. Franziska: What...? Edgeworth: (What can I use to show her that it's possible the box was not always where it is now?) Present Refueling in Zheng Fa Edgeworth: Leads to: \"You refueled in the Republic of Zheng Fa...!?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Doesn't this show sufficient probability to you? Franziska: Wh-Why are you asking me!? I was the one asking you! Gumshoe: I think there's some possibility in that, siiiiiiiiiiiir! Franziska: No one was asking for opinions from the instant noodle crowd, Scruffy! Edgeworth: (I suppose this is where the phrase \"to be whipped by one's opponent\" came from.) Franziska: Don't act as though you have nothing to do with this! Now answer the question! Edgeworth: (I suppose she's right. But first, I should reconsider all of the information I have.) Leads back to: \"What can I use to show her that it's possible the box was not always where it is now?\" Franziska: You refueled in the Republic of Zheng Fa...!? Edgeworth: Yes, this flight had a short layover in Zheng Fa in order to refuel. But that wasn't the only reason for the layover. We also transferred some cargo. What if the box in question was only transferred onto the plane at that time? To further prove my point, let's take a look at what's next to the box in question. Gumshoe: Ah! It's labeled \"Zheng Fa Express\"! Edgeworth: Correct. Meaning it was loaded onto the plane in Zheng Fa. Cargo from Zheng Fa data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Now, what if the box in question was also loaded on at the same time? Franziska: It would mean that the box... ...was not here in the cargo hold during the Europe - Zheng Fa leg of the flight. Edgeworth: Making a clear drop from which Agent Hicks could've fallen to his death entirely possible! Franziska: Ah, but your theory is still very far-fetched. Edgeworth: Then allow me a chance to prove how very likely my scenario is. (My first order of business will be to examine that piece of cargo in more detail...) Begin Investigation Lower Deck Cargo Hold Talk Zinc Lablanc or officer at top of stairs Lablanc: [Borginese speaking]! [Borginese speaking]! [Borginese speaking]! Officer: You can rant at me in Borginian all you want, but no still means no, sir! Lablanc: What!? You cheap man! You are only waiting for me to give you money, yes!? Gumshoe: This guy is really pushy... I wonder if he really makes any sales this way. Edgeworth: As long as I never have to face him in court, he can be as pushy as he wants. Franziska von Karma Edgeworth: If I may have a word with you, Franziska... Franziska: I don't think you have the time for idle chatter. You still need to prove to me that your hypothetical situation is, in fact, reality. Officer next to open suitcase Gumshoe: If you spot anything off, you come and tell me right away, OK, pal!? Officer: Roger, sir! Edgeworth: (It's rather unusual for Gumshoe to be so directing. He must outrank this officer.) Gumshoe: If you run into any trouble, you just leave it up to me, OK? Officer: Yes, sir...! Ah! Watch out, Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Owwwwwwwwwww!!! Franziska: Scruffy! I think your ego is in need of some deflating. Gumshoe: I-I was following in your footsteps, sir... I wanna try patronizing my subordinates. Edgeworth: (Cruel and unforgiving to the Detective, even in front of his own subordinate...) Examine Large cargo Leads to: \"Hmm... This is a rather large piece of cargo.\" Yellow suitcases Edgeworth: The left-over suitcases sit here, lined up in two pretty, neat rows. Too bad for Ms. Teneiro, but this design is unmarketable. Gumshoe: I'd buy one if it was [sic] cheaper, sir! Do you think they'd sell it to me at a discount? Oh! Or! Why don't they sell them in the airport and have a bargain basement sale!? \"Buy one get one free! If you win the raffle, you get one more for free!\" How about those ideas, sir!? Edgeworth: I think if they did that, everyone would lose. Open suitcase Edgeworth: So Mr. Hicks was actually an Interpol agent... Gumshoe: That is so cool! I can't believe he was from Interpol! The adventure! The glamour! And the miraculous big escape when you get caught by the enemy! Edgeworth: ...Except, in this case, there was no big escape. Gumshoe: ...And no miracle. Partner Cause of death Gumshoe: Man... I can't believe Mr. Hicks fell to his death. I never would have guessed in a million years! Edgeworth: That is still only a hypothesis, however, the investigation should prove it to be true. Gumshoe: Speaking of falling, I'm glad that art guy's OK! He took quite the spill! Edgeworth: Yes, he was lucky to have landed on top of that piece of cargo. Gumshoe: Yeah, I can just see it now. \"Passenger Pays Price for Police Foul Up! Did Prosecutor Edgeworth add fuel to the fire of the first murder with a second death!?\" Yup, I'm willing to bet that it'd make the front page! Edgeworth: .........! (That's not funny, Detective!) Edgeworth: Hmm... This is a rather large piece of cargo. Gumshoe: There's a tag on it, sir... Let's see... \"Alif Red Statue\"...? Never heard of it. Edgeworth: Nor I, but all I care about is if we can prove it wasn't here at the time of the crime. Gumshoe: Then let's get investigating, sir! Lablanc: [Borginese speaking]! [Borginese speaking]! Look here! Do not go about touching my possessions without my permission! Gumshoe: Aaack! D-Don't rush up on me like that, pal! Edgeworth: (So this belongs to Mr. Lablanc, does it? I should see what else I can find out from him...) Talk Zinc Lablanc Talk Lablanc's cargo Edgeworth: I take it that this large piece of cargo belongs to you, Mr. Lablanc? Lablanc: Of course it is mine! I shipped this fine piece of art from Europe! This \"Alif Red Statue\" is worth 10 million cents! No! Maybe much, much more! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Mr. Lablanc's reason for choosing this plane must've been the large cargo hold.) Gumshoe: Ten million cents...?  Edgeworth: I suggest you stop trying to calculate how many packets of noodles that makes, Detective. Gumshoe: Darn... How did you do that!? I feel like you keep getting better and better at seeing right through me every year! Edgeworth: (Though I grow with each revolution of the planet around the sun... ...I have the distinct impression he continues to madly spin in place.) Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... So that 10 million cents... Is that in Euros or in Dollars? Edgeworth: .........Does it really make a difference to our case!? Mr. Lablanc, there is a chance that your cargo is related to our murder case. I was wondering if you would allow us to examine it a bit closer. Lablanc: It is a very valuable piece of art (Valuable piece of art - Mr. Lablanc claims to have brought a piece of art from Europe, but...)! So, no! There will be no touching! Fake statue (after connecting Logic) Leads to: \"About your statue, Mr. Lablanc...\" Present Borginian Cloth Lablanc: What a waste! How horrible to see a priceless piece of cloth soiled! Edgeworth: I-I assure you it wasn't me! I believe it to be the work of the killer. Lablanc: I will teach that killer a lesson! You can be sure I will! It will be the \"Lablanc Revolution\"! Edgeworth: (I think he meant the \"Lablanc Retribution\", but either way, it sounds intimidating.) Anything else Lablanc: Why do you show me something of no value!? \"Show me the bread\" first and maybe we will talk! Edgeworth: (Wait, he wants me to pay him before he'll comment on this?) Officer at top of stairs Edgeworth: Good job, officer. Mr. Lablanc is certainly not an easy person to hold back. Officer: No thanks necessary, sir! It's all part of the job... even if he did eventually get by... Edgeworth: Well, I have a few things to ask him anyway, so it worked out in your favor this time. Officer: Thank you very much, sir! Next time, I'll be sure to not let anyone through... ...even if it takes my life in the process, sir! Edgeworth: ...I appreciate the sentiment, however, we can't have people getting hurt on the job either. Examine Large cargo Lablanc: Look here! Do not go about touching my possessions without my permission! Edgeworth: (I suppose I have to first appease Mr. Lablanc if I want to examine this in more detail.) Logic Connect \"Smuggling\" and \"Valuable piece of art\" Edgeworth: (If Mr. Lablanc has something to do with the smuggling ring... ...then it's possible this fake statue was brought onboard in Zheng Fa! I think I need to question him a bit further.) Partner Valuable artwork (appears after clearing \"Lablanc's cargo\" Talk option with Zinc Lablanc) Gumshoe: What exactly is an \"extremely valuable piece of art\", sir? It is like the stuff you see at county fairs? Edgeworth: Somehow, I get the impression that it's worth a lot more than you can comprehend. Gumshoe: So this thing is worth more than I can imagine, huh. Whooooooooop! It kinda makes me wanna try collecting expensive art! Edgeworth: Collecting expensive art...? Hmm... Interesting. It seems there are people out there besides Mr. Lablanc who know the true value of art. Gumshoe: Huh? ...Are you talking about me, sir? Edgeworth: Of course not! Where did you get an idea like that!? Edgeworth: About your statue, Mr. Lablanc... ...I wonder if it might be a fake. Lablanc: Wh-What!? How dare you say my art is fake! Edgeworth: I suspect that your statue... might be the target of an international smuggling ring. Lablanc: Don't say such fantastical things! Those thieves would not dare! I have the certification of my cargo right here! Franziska: Do you mean the Cargo Certification document? Mr. Zinc Lablanc! Why didn't you say so earlier!? Please show it to us at once! ......... I can't read this! What does it say!? Lablanc: It says as plain as day \"the cargo was put onto the plane in Europe\"! Franziska: And there you have it, Miles Edgeworth. Too bad for you... ...this statue was brought onboard in Europe, just as it states in this certificate. Edgeworth: No, that's...! Franziska: Which means that there never was a window of time in which the statue wasn't sitting there! Alif Red Certificate data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: ............ I respectfully disagree. We can't discount the theory until I see the statue for myself! Lablanc: Hmph! Then you can have your wish! Look at it yourself and see I am right! Edgeworth: This...! I know I've seen this somewhere before... Gumshoe: This is the \"Alif Red\"!? It gives off such a feeling of ART! I can practically smell it! Lablanc: This statue has a high amount of historic value! After it was unveiled at a museum in Europe... ...I brought it to this country to exhibit it! Alif Red Statue data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: (I believe a closer look is warranted here...) Talk Zinc Lablanc Lablanc: I grant you permission to look, but if you make tiny, single fingerprint... ...I will make you pay 10 million cents! Edgeworth: Isn't that the value of the statue itself!? Lablanc: Of course! It is the price of my very valuable time and the loaning of my statue! Now you wasted another minute! That will make your bill 11 million cents now! Edgeworth: (Ack! I'm going to have to conduct this examination with even greater haste!) Examine Statue in display Edgeworth: So this is the infamous Alif Red statue... Hm? Gumshoe: What is it, Mr. Edgeworth? Did you find something? Edgeworth: There's something... wrong with this picture. We should examine it in more detail. Examine Statue Edgeworth: (So this is the Alif Red statue... I swear I've seen this somewhere before...) Gumshoe: No wonder this thing is worth 10 million cents! Look at how it sparkles, sir! Edgeworth: I wouldn't call it \"sparkling\", Detective... Maybe more along the lines of... \"dully shining\". Statue (after correctly deducing statue's eyes) Edgeworth: So this Alif Red is a fake... Gumshoe: That art dealer isn't looking too happy about it either, sir. Edgeworth: I will get to the bottom of this, for his sake as well as mine. Statue (after correctly deducing cloth under statue) Edgeworth: So this statue was brought onboard in Zheng Fa... Gumshoe: Which means it's a fake, right, sir? Edgeworth: Yes, and there is still one last contradiction to resolve here. Gumshoe: Huh? Where? Edgeworth: As unobservant as ever, I see. Take a good look at the evidence and it'll come to you. Statue's eyes Edgeworth: Are these eyes made of some sort of gem...? Gumshoe: That's a real nice shade of orange! For a sec, I couldn't even tell they were jewels! Oh, but they kinda remind me of the eyes of this stray cat that lives near my house! Edgeworth: (Are the eyes supposed to be this color...? Is it possible this statue... is a fake...?) Statue's eyes (after correctly deducing statue's eyes) Gumshoe: I can't believe you were able to tell this was a fake from a single glance, sir! You knew right away that its eyes were a different color than the ones in the photo! Edgeworth: Yes, unlike a certain Detective who needs to try a little harder... (The fact that this is a fake means it was swapped with the real one at some point...) Covered cargo next to statue Edgeworth: What have we here...? Gumshoe: It says \"Zheng Fa Express\" on the cloth, sir! I'm gonna take a guess and say that this delivery company is based in Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: (Something is tugging on the corner of my mind... as though something is out of place...?) Yellow suitcases Edgeworth: The left-over suitcases sit here, lined up in two pretty, neat rows. Too bad for Ms. Teneiro, but this design is unmarketable. Gumshoe: Oh! Why don't they sell them in the airport and have a bargain basement sale!? \"Buy one get one free! If you win the raffle, you get one more for free!\" How about those ideas, sir!? Edgeworth: I think if they did that, everyone would lose. Cloth under statue Edgeworth: (What's this...?) Gumshoe: The statue looks like it's stepping all over its neighbor's cloth cover. It kinda resembles its owner's attitude in a sense, ho ho! Lablanc: You! What did you said now!? Further, my clothing's hem is not being stepped on by anyone! It is too expensive for me to allow that to happen! Edgeworth: Please forgive the trespasses of my subordinate. Lablanc: Why should I forgive if the dress passes!? Unless it is an expensive dress, you keep it! Edgeworth: ............ Cloth under statue (after correctly deducing cloth under statue) Gumshoe: I can't believe you could spot a contradiction from a piece of cloth getting stuck! Lablanc: You two! Why do you continue talking about the hem of my clothing being stuck!? Edgeworth: (The fact that this was brought onboard in Zheng Fa... ...is going to bring many a tears [sic] to Mr. Lablanc's eyes.) Deduce statue's eyes Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Photo of Mr. Hicks (before correctly deducing cloth under statue) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These eyes are awfully orange, don't you think? Gumshoe: Yeah, and pretty! They remind me of sunsets when I was in grade school, sir! Edgeworth: ...I don't think you see what I'm talking about. Gumshoe: No, I do. But it's really like the color of the sun when it's setting, sir! Ah, the memories... I remember standing out in that field, spinning with my arms out until I felt ill... Edgeworth: I don't care about sunsets! Focus, Detective! What color are the eyes in this photo!? Gumshoe: H-Huh!? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Sir! They're red! Edgeworth: As I thought... This statue is a fake. Mr. Lablanc. Lablanc: What do you want!? Do you not know I am a busy man!? I allow you two seconds for your answer! Edgeworth: The Alif Red... I suppose this is your pride and joy, is it not? Lablanc: It is the biggest trophy on this European trip! Do you know why I wanted to possess this statue? The trigger started 17 years ago... Gumshoe: Better grab a chair, sir. Sounds like this is gonna be a long story... Edgeworth: Mr. Lablanc, I regret to inform you, and you have my heartfelt sympathy, but... Lablanc: What is that? Sympathy? For what? Edgeworth: You'll see. I'd like you to compare the eyes. Lablanc: ...That large fellow there has very bright and pretty eyes compared to you. Edgeworth: I wasn't talking about the two of us! I meant the eyes of the statue in front of us and the one in this photo! Lablanc: Why the sudden yelling!? Now then... Ohhh! It is a photo of the statue on display at the museum in Europe! ............Nnwwwhaaaaaaah!!! Edgeworth: Now do you see, Mr. Lablanc? The statue before us is a fake. Lablanc: A...A faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!? Edgeworth: I believe that even further examination will be required... ...now that we have confirmed that this is indeed a fake. There must be some sort of proof that this was brought onboard in Zheng Fa. And I will present to you evidence that will resolve the remaining contradiction! Present Photo of Mr. Hicks (after correctly deducing cloth under statue) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These eyes are awfully orange, don't you think? Gumshoe: Yeah, and pretty! They remind me of sunsets when I was in grade school, sir! Edgeworth: ...I don't think you see what I'm talking about. Gumshoe: No, I do. But it's really like the color of the sun when it's setting, sir! Ah, the memories... I remember standing out in that field, spinning with my arms out until I felt ill...

Gumshoe: Better grab a chair, sir. Sounds like this is gonna be a long story... Edgeworth: Mr. Lablanc, I regret to inform you, and you have my heartfelt sympathy, but... Lablanc: What is that? Sympathy? For what? Edgeworth: You'll see. I'd like you to compare the eyes. Lablanc: ...That large fellow there has very bright and pretty eyes compared to you. Edgeworth: I wasn't talking about the two of us! I meant the eyes of the statue in front of us and the one in this photo! Lablanc: Why the sudden yelling!? Now then... Ohhh! It is a photo of the statue on display at the museum in Europe! ............Nnwwwhaaaaaaah!!! Edgeworth: Now do you see, Mr. Lablanc? The statue before us is a fake. Lablanc: A...A faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!? Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not entirely confident that there is a contradiction here... What do you think, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, I think it's really suspicious-looking, sir! My well-trained gut tells me so! Edgeworth: ............I see. Well then, I must be mistaken. Gumshoe: How come when I answer confidently, you take that to mean we're off course, sir? Leads back to examination of statue in display Deduce cloth under statue Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Cargo from Zheng Fa (before correctly deducing statue's eyes) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There is clearly a contradiction here! Franziska: What are you going on about? It's just a simple case of a cargo cover getting stuck under another piece of cargo. ............ Ah! That's not possible...! Edgeworth: But it is... It shouldn't be this way, but the statue is on top of the cloth. Supposing that the neighboring piece of cargo was brought onboard in Zheng Fa... ...there is no way that any part of it should wind up under something from Europe. Which means that this fake statue was smuggled onboard in Zheng Fa! Franziska: But then what about the cargo certificate!? Edgeworth: Let me ask in return, what about Agent Hicks? Why did he come down here in the middle of the flight? Franziska: ? Edgeworth: There is only one reason why: to secure proof of smuggling activity aboard this flight. Franziska: So you say, but I don't believe he had to do that mid-flight. We could've just as easily inspected all of the cargo after the plane landed. Edgeworth: That may be true, however, you have it backwards, Franziska. Sure, Agent Hicks could have waited until after the plane had landed... ...but he had a reason for coming down to the cargo hold. Suppose he had found the fake at the airport. It would've been after the swap had occurred. At that time, the suspicion would naturally fall onto the statue's owner... ...who would have no way to prove that the statue was switched without his knowledge. Which means there is someone involved who is forging or modifying cargo certificates. Alif Red Certificate data updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: I believe that even further examination will be required... ...now that we have confirmed that this was brought onboard in Zheng Fa. There must be some sort of proof that this statue is indeed a fake. And I will present to you evidence that will resolve the remaining contradiction!

Leads back to examination of statue in display Statue in display (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Covered cargo next to statue Edgeworth: What have we here...? Gumshoe: It says \"Zheng Fa Express\" on the cloth, sir! I'm gonna take a guess and say that this delivery company is based in Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: If that's the case, then we can assume this was loaded onto the plane in Zheng Fa. (Something is tugging on the corner of my mind... as though something is out of place...?) Examine evidence Alif Red Statue Statue's eyes Edgeworth: This statue's eyes look like they're made of a jewel-like stone. Gumshoe: Those gems sure are pretty! And look at that fiery orange color, sir! Edgeworth: Well, according to Mr. Lablanc, this whole thing is worth a pretty penny. Gumshoe: Ooh! I just got a really great idea! I can probably find some rocks down by the river I can polish up to look like real jewels! I think I'll try that out and give one to Maggey as a present next time! Edgeworth: (I wonder if he's serious... and I wonder if I should try to stop him if he is...) Statue's eyes (after correctly deducing statue's eyes) Edgeworth: The jewels in the eye sockets... They were made to look just like real gems. Gumshoe: So you mean... these aren't real? Edgeworth: Do you really think the forgers would waste that kind of money on a replica? Gumshoe: I guess not... Ooh! I just got a really great idea! I can probably find some rocks down by the river I can polish up to look like real jewels! I think I'll try that out and give one to Maggey as a present next time! Edgeworth: (I wonder if he's serious... and I wonder if I should try to stop him if he is...) Partner Smuggling Gumshoe: Phoo-whee! I thought something smelled fishy in here! Turns out it's a smuggling ring! Edgeworth: If a smuggling ring is [sic] involved in this case... ...then their target would most definitely be the most valuable piece of art. Gumshoe: And that'd be the two statues on either side of the elevator, right, sir!? Edgeworth: I doubt those ghastly things are worth anything to anyone other than the person depicted. After correctly deducing statue's eyes and cloth under statue: Investigation Complete Gumshoe: I guess the victim knew the real version of this was gonna get nabbed, huh? Edgeworth: Yes. While this photo could be seen as nothing more than a simple souvenir... ...it was in fact taken to be used as a reference document later on. Next, Agent Hicks had to secure proof that the smuggling had taken place. He came down here to take a picture of the cargo hold... ...a rather empty one at that, right before the fake statue could be loaded onboard. Franziska: A photo of the hold missing a valuable piece of cargo would have been proof enough. After that, all he had to do was hold the Zheng Fa cargo crew and arrest the smuggler. Edgeworth: Exactly. This only goes to prove my theory. If the statue was [sic] not in the cargo hold during the Europe - Zheng Fa leg of the trip... ...there would've been enough height from which Agent Hicks could've fallen to his death! Franziska: ...Officer! Move this statue immediately! I want a thorough examination of the floor underneath. Now! Forensics: Ms. von Karma! I'm ready to report my findings. Franziska: Go on. Forensics: After moving the Alif Red statue out of the way... ...we tested the area under it with Luminol, and there was a reaction! Franziska: I see, there was a reaction to Luminol... An indication that there was blood in that spot. Gumshoe: Nngh... Can we stop looking at it now, sirs...? Edgeworth: It would seem that my deductions were correct after all. Franziska: ...I suppose it would appear that way. Edgeworth: The culprit cleaned the blood up well. Franziska: And how do you think the killer did that? Edgeworth: How did the killer clean up all the blood? Present Borginian Cloth Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The killer used the bloody cloth I found inside the suitcase to clean up the mess.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I would suppose that... perhaps the culprit used this... to clean up the blood. Franziska: There is no need for you to waste your breath if you're just going to waste my time. After all, I hate to waste my energy on wasteful whipping. Edgeworth: (If it's that wasteful, then I'd rather that you didn't whip me at all! For the killer to clean up the blood, they would've needed something to soak it up.) Leads back to: \"How did the killer clean up all the blood?\" Edgeworth: The killer used the bloody cloth I found inside the suitcase to clean up the mess. Franziska: I see. They had a need to clean up all the blood before the plane landed in Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: Yes, because otherwise, the cargo crew would've discovered it during the layover. Gumshoe: So you guys are saying... ...that the murder happened before the plane landed in Zheng Fa!? Edgeworth: (There is no other conceivable timeline for the events of the murder. But if that is true, then that throws a certain person's testimony into doubt!) If the murder occurred before we landed in Zheng Fa, then this becomes highly suspect! Ms. Teneiro's testimony Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro's testimony... is not particularly suspect, correct? Franziska: ...Correct. Edgeworth: Well, that's all well and good. Glad we agree. Franziska: ............ No, that is not all well and good, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Arrgnnnh! (I suppose there's no fooling her. The point to focus on is the fact that the crime occurred before we landed in Zheng Fa.) Leads back to: \"If the murder occurred before we landed in Zheng Fa, then this becomes highly suspect!\" Ms. Meele's testimony Leads to: \"Recall Ms. Meele's testimony about Agent Hicks in regard to when we departed Zheng Fa.\" Mr. Lablanc's testimony Edgeworth: The times referenced by Mr. Lablanc in his testimony are inaccurate. However, I believe the actual body of his testimony is fairly reliable... Franziska: What are you sputtering on about over there!? Hurry up with your answer! Edgeworth: H-Hold on! I'm still collecting my thoughts! (The point to focus on is the fact that the crime occurred before we landed in Zheng Fa.) Leads back to: \"If the murder occurred before we landed in Zheng Fa, then this becomes highly suspect!\" Edgeworth: Recall Ms. Meele's testimony about Agent Hicks in regard to when we departed Zheng Fa. Meele: I saw Mr. Hicks sitting in his seat at 5 AM, you know. Edgeworth: She claims Agent Hicks was alive at the time of the service calls, but... Gumshoe: That totally contradicts the facts, sir! Franziska: But why would she lie about something like that? Edgeworth: I think the only person who can answer that is Ms. Meele herself! To be continued March 12, 3:35 PM Flight G-390 (changed from [I-390] in the original release), Lower Deck - Cargo Hold Edgeworth: Ms. Meele. Meele: ......... Edgeworth: Ms. Meele! Meele: Huh!? Edgeworth: Do you recall what you said earlier... ...about when you answered some service calls as we were departing from Zheng Fa? Meele: ..................Huh? Edgeworth: You said that Mr. Hicks was sitting in his seat at that time. However... that is simply not possible! Because Mr. Hicks was dead long before we ever touched down in Zheng Fa! Meele: ..................Oh? Edgeworth: Ms. Cammy Meele! Meele: ......... Um... Maybe I didn't see what I thought I did? Edgeworth: No one could make a mistake so large, Ms. Meele! Meele: Ummmmmm... But I make that kind of boo-boo all the time. Edgeworth: .........Nnngh! Franziska: This is going nowhere. There must be a better way of resolving this contradiction. Edgeworth: Very well. Ms. Meele, if you please, tell me about your alibi during the time span... ...from just before we were to land at 3 AM and 6 AM when the body was found. Meele: .........Are you telling me I'm a suspect, Mr. Edgeworth? Testimony -- Ms. Meele's Alibi -- Meele: .....................Mnngh. Oh, um... yeah... From 3 to 4, I was, um... in the flight attendants' room all by my lonesome self. .....................Mnngh. Oh, um... yeah... And from 5 to 6, I was, um... in the flight attendants' room all by my lonesome self. Edgeworth: (How is a man supposed to react to a testimony like that...?) Ms. Meele! Wake up! Meele: Ah! ...............zzz. Edgeworth: (*sigh* She fell asleep again. It looks like the only way I'm going to be able to wake her up is by pressing her...) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Ms. Meele! Wake up! Meele: *yawn* I'm awake, I'm awake. ..................zzz. Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! I demand that you do something about this flight attendant this instant! Edgeworth: (Why ask me to wake her when you can finally put that whip to an appropriate use?) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If I remember correctly, food was being served in First Class and the Lounge... ...between the hours of 3 and 4 AM. Meele: Yeah, but that kind of stuff's run by Ms. Rhoda. Edgeworth: Then what were you doing in the attendants' room at that time? Meele: Eating, and then having a most delicious dream! Edgeworth: You mean you were neglecting your duties! Meele: No way! Sleeping's part of our job, too, you know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Ms. Meele! How many times do I have to repeat myself!? Wake up! Meele: *yawn* I'm awake, I'm awake. ..................zzz. Franziska: ......! Gumshoe: Yeowch!! Wh-What did you whip me for, siiir!? Meele: Ooh, what did I miss? Edgeworth: A poor detective being on the receiving end of a lash in your stead. Meele: Really? Heh, sorry 'bout that. Edgeworth: You can make amends for that by continuing with your testimony. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were alone the entire time, were you? Meele: Yeah, no one else even popped their head in to say, \"Hi!\" Edgeworth: (Oh? Well, I think a contradiction just popped in to say, \"Hi!\" What should I do? Should I raise an objection?) Raise an objection Edgeworth: Ms. Meele! There is a clear contradiction embedded in your testimony! Meele: Huh? What are you talking about? Edgeworth: It's not possible that you were alone in the attendants' room the whole time from 5 to 6 AM! Present Suitcase Receipt Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I wonder if you would be so kind as to take a look at this receipt, Ms. Meele.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Now take a look at this eye-opening piece of evidence! Meele: ...............zzz. Edgeworth: Ms. Meele! I need you to wake up and take a look at this! Franziska: Enough of your foolishness! Now hurry up and show us the real evidence! Edgeworth: (Arngh! I guess this wasn't as eye-opening as I thought...) Meele: ..................Mnngh. Oh! Did you say something? Leads back to rebuttal Don't raise an objection Edgeworth: (Maybe not yet. She hasn't exactly given me much to object to, yet, after all...) Meele: *yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn* What did I miss? Leads back to rebuttal Edgeworth: Ms. Meele! There is a clear contradiction embedded in your testimony! Meele: Huh? What are you talking about? Edgeworth: It's not possible that you were alone in the attendants' room the whole time from 5 to 6 AM! Present Suitcase Receipt Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I wonder if you would be so kind as to take a look at this receipt, Ms. Meele.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Now take a look at this eye-opening piece of evidence! Meele: ...............zzz. Edgeworth: Ms. Meele! I need you to wake up and take a look at this! Franziska: Enough of your foolishness! Now hurry up and show us the real evidence! Edgeworth: (Arngh!

Meele: What do you mean? I've been awake this whole time... Gumshoe: Aww, it's alright if you were sleeping, pal! Franziska: Pay no mind to the scruffy detective beside you, and wake up! Gumshoe: Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw! Hurry up and wake up, Ms. Meele! Edgeworth: (Enough with the clowning around. This is my show and I will resolve the contradictions as I see fit!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: ??? \u2192 Akbey Hicks\nDescription: The victim.

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts Cammy Meele's testimony. The testimonies given by Meele are in Testimony 1 and 3. She claims she was alone in the attendants' room from 3-4 AM and from 5-6 AM.\n\nLooking at the evidence, the Suitcase Receipt (Evidence 12) has a timestamp of 5:40 AM. Rhoda Teneiro bought the suitcase at that time. But the receipt was found in the attendants' room. If Meele was alone there from 5-6 AM, she should have seen Teneiro entering to leave the receipt. But Teneiro was in the shop at 5:40, which means she had to be in the attendants' room around that time to leave the receipt. This contradicts Meele's claim of being alone there during that period. So the receipt (Evidence 12) contradicts Testimony 3 (about being alone from 5-6)."

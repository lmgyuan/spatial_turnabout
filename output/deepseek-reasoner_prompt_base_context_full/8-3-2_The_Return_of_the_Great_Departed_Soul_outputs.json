Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light. Rendered dialogue We're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment! Ladies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you! 22nd October, 9:36 a.m. Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ...Runo! Runo, are you listening? Ryunosuke: Oh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris? Iris: Hmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast? Ryunosuke: No no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again? Iris: Today's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again! Ryunosuke: Ah yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. ......... Iris: You're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Iris: Oh gosh! You're even more down! Sholmes: ......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together. Sholmes: What?! Why didn't you mention it before? Ryunosuke: I, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast? Sholmes: Hm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence. Ryunosuke: (...Thanks.) Sholmes: Of course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations. Ryunosuke: What?! Sholmes: Let's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that- Ryunosuke: Um, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact. Sholmes: Oh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks again.) ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now. Iris: Six months? Ryunosuke: Since I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned. Iris: Oh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Ryunosuke: (Ah...back to moping...) Ryunosuke: What's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me. Iris: I know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together? Sholmes: I want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being. Ryunosuke: Why not? Sholmes: Why not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all! Ryunosuke: (So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?) Iris: I don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: (I suppose I should try to find out what's going on.) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Well, I must be leaving now. Ryunosuke: Yes, understood. See you later, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Hah! You really are a shameless liar sometimes, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: You seek to put me off my guard and follow me, don't you? Well, you would be wasting your time. Ryunosuke: The thought hadn't crossed my mind! (But now I'm wondering where you're going...) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha hah! Well then, 'see you later' indeed! Ryunosuke: (Listen to him. He's still laughing on his way out of the door...) Iris: Alright then, Runo! Let's get going! Ryunosuke: Oh! Um, Iris... What are you wearing? Iris: I've got changed to go to the Great Exhibition. You're going to take me! Ryunosuke: What? But, but I was just about to go to the Supreme Court... Iris: Oh! Well that sounds fun, too! You're going to take me there, then! Ryunosuke: Alright, fine. Just...lower that weapon, would you? Iris: Of course! And after the Supreme Court, then we'll go to see the Great Exhibition! 22nd October Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: It's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. (It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...) Iris: Oh, I love this place! I always find so many interesting books here! Ryunosuke: Of course. I was forgetting that you've been here before. (The time we came here six months ago... ...when Susato-san was given the news that she was to return to Japan.) ???: Ah. I understand you wish to speak with me. Ryunosuke: Oh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well? Stronghart: Let's see... Since you've arrived and requested an audience, it's been four hours, thirty-two minutes and... ...twenty-six seconds. I've kept you waiting a while. My apologies. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all! I like nothing more than standing around, staring into space. Stronghart: ...Good to know. Ryunosuke: (...Good to know that doesn't appear to bother him at all.) Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of London. He's the man who allowed me to start practising as a defence lawyer when I arrived in Britain as a student. You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status. Stronghart: As you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: Oh...I've not heard about that. Stronghart: Investigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it. Ryunosuke: (...Well, it's nice to know where I stand.) Stronghart: So...you wish to consult with me? Of course, I can very well imagine what this is about. Ryunosuke: Ah...well, um... Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, My Lord! (I want to be allowed to start working as a defence lawyer again in court. That's what brought me here today. But actually, there's something else playing on my mind, as it happens...) Iris: Runo, just take a deep breath and come out with it! After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: Well, I must be leaving for my next engagement. I'm already...eleven hours and sixteen minutes late. ...My colleagues may be starting to fidget. Ryunosuke: E-Eleven hours late? That's...quite something. Stronghart: That meeting had already started when I arrived back here for this engagement with you. So lateness was inevitable. Time stops for no man. Ryunosuke: (I'm sure it stopped for me during those twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three reasons...) Oh, yes! Where would I find Lord van Zieks now? Stronghart: I would assume he's at his office. Ryunosuke: (Right, I'll go and ask him about the attack in person. I want to get this straight from the horse's mouth...) Stronghart: Away with you now. I'm leaving Professor Harebrayne's defence entirely in your hands. Ryunosuke: Of, of course, yes! Thank you very much, My Lord! 22nd October Prosecutor's Office Iris: Ooh! So this is the legendary Reaper's office? Ryunosuke: Yes, it appears so. Iris: Brrr, it sends a chill down your spine, doesn't it? What an amazingly deathly atmosphere! Ryunosuke: ...Oh, is that...? (That hooded figure was so still, I hadn't noticed his or her presence. I wonder who it is...?) ???: What are you doing here? Ryunosuke: Agh! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (He's as unwelcoming as I thought he'd be. Actually, maybe even more so...) Oh, I, um... I'm glad to see you're well. Van Zieks: ...I am. Ryunosuke: ......... So...who's the person over by the wall being...punished for something or other? Van Zieks: No punishment is taking place here. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: That's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will. Ryunosuke: I didn't know you had an apprentice. (It must be the same person who was pictured in the newspaper...) Van Zieks: He's very able in combat. ...A requisite skill for anyone under my tutelage. Ryunosuke: Are you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers? Van Zieks: The Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms... After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: Ah yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you... Ryunosuke: Oh! What's that? Van Zieks: That Nipponese man. Is he faring well? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: The one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters. Ryunosuke: Ah! Mr Natsume, you mean? Iris: ...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo. Ryunosuke: He's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day. Van Zieks: I see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. (I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.) Iris: I never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books! Ryunosuke: A mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? (Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.) 22nd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: The warden said cell eleven. That's this one... Iris: Oh! There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look! Ryunosuke: What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: ...! Who are you? Ryunosuke: I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer. Harebrayne: A LAWYER! Ryunosuke: Agh! (Was it something I said?!) Harebrayne: A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?! Ryunosuke: Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't- Harebrayne: Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah... Ryunosuke: ......... (Now's probably not a good time to mention that your zeal made my concentration leave for a while, too...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: So, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct? Harebrayne: As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life! Ryunosuke: ......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Harebrayne: ......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything. Ryunosuke: Thank you for that, Professor. Harebrayne: And thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court! Iris: Alright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: Well, that's where the incident happened, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, I suppose that's true. (Time to investigate at last!) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Ryunosuke: Ugh... The showgrounds are a little too big for my liking... We've been walking around in dense crowds for two hours now, and I've felt myself swooning three times. Iris: There are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too! Ryunosuke: ...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. (We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.) ???: .........! ???: .........! Ryunosuke: (What's that...? I can hear voices from up on the stage. It sounds like an argument...) ???: Right, I've had it with you this time! I'm warnin' you, I'll arrest you in a minute! ???: Oh yeah? Go on then, 'Spector, give it a shot! You ain't got no evidence, an' you know it! Ryunosuke: (Wait... I know those voices.) ???: You've got a cheeky little mouth on you, young lady! But a night in the cells will teach you some manners! ???: Just try it, I dare ya! If ya want that bag o' chips rammed down yer throat! Iris: Yoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there? Gregson: ......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship? Ryunosuke: (...Does that make her three times a lady?) Iris: I'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue. Gregson: Unbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you! Ryunosuke: Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. (But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!) Gregson: Watch it, sunshine! Ryunosuke: S-Sorry... Gregson: What gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case? Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm acting for the defence. Iris: So we're here to investigate! Gregson: Hmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it? Ryunosuke: (Is it really that troubling?) ???: Tsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo! Ryunosuke: Wha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is! ???: Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob. Ryunosuke: This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court. Gina: Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya? Ryunosuke: I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground. Gina: That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's Inspector Lestrade now! Ryunosuke: In... Inspector?! (That badge is homemade, surely...) Gregson: The 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us. Iris: What's that supposed to mean? Gregson: Right, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright? Gina: Right...sir. Ryunosuke: (This... This raises a LOT of questions!) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Iris: Runo, Runo, listen! Ryunosuke: What? What is it? Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like? Ryunosuke: No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow! Iris: But that's where Hurley is. Ryunosuke: What? At, at this popular London attraction? Iris: Yes! Ryunosuke: How is it that you know where he is? Iris: Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Ryunosuke: So that's it, is it? The machine that blew up. Iris: Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share. Ryunosuke: You've seen things like this before, you mean? Iris: Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!' Ryunosuke: Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs. Iris: One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof. Iris: Well anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate! Ryunosuke: Ah look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully. Iris: Really? He just looks confused to me. Ryunosuke: It ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it? Iris: Magnificently...and mercilessly. Ryunosuke: So someone stands in the middle of the machine to be disassembled and then 'beamed' through the air... Iris: Yes, 'beamed' not 'blasted'. That's the point. Ryunosuke: (Yes, that part's crucial, really.) Is something like that even possible, though, Iris? Iris: Oh, Runo. I'm just a child. How should I know? Ryunosuke: (A child when it suits you, you mean...) Iris: From what I can tell, I think if you were to pull this lever here- Gregson: STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! Don't touch that! Iris: Ah ha ha! That was practically instantaneous kinesis the way you flew over just now, Gregsy! Gregson: Please, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here. Iris: So sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it. Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful! Ryunosuke: (It's just like old times, this is...) We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene! Gregson: Hah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, that special dispensation... (The professor mentioned that, too.) Gregson: More red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes. Iris: But...we're allowed to just look, aren't we? Gregson: Eh? Iris: Surely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy? Gregson: ......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! Anythin' you say, Your Ladyship! But please don't get your dainty hands dirty, will you? Iris: Don't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo? Ryunosuke: (She really knows how to get what she wants...) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Gregson: Right, are you done here, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gregson: Isn't it about time you were leavin'? Or rather...it IS about time you were leavin'! That lot are here now. Iris: That lot? Gregson: The Forensic Investigation Team. They'll be givin' me the heave-ho in a minute, too. Iris: Oh dear. Poor Gregsy. Here! Have another cup of my special blend to cheer you up! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! That hit the spot! Yup, hits it every time! Ryunosuke: (Well, at least I've seen the scene with my own eyes. It looks like this is as far as we're going to get with our investigations here at least...) Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment!

But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) Prosecutor's Office Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Ryunosuke: Wh-What is this place? L-Look at all these t-terrifying scenes! But why are all the p-people so still? (Guillotines... Ruthless murderers... I know what I'll be dreaming about tonight.) Iris: They're all wax models. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked? Ryunosuke: W-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere! Iris: ...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif- Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Iris: What now? Ryunosuke: I've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display. Iris: None of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas. Ryunosuke: They can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them! Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: There's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait. Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: Oh...no... (I must be seeing things...) Ryunosuke: It's...it's... ...the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! (Mr Sholmes has his own wax statue in here? Really?) Iris: Well he is world-famous, after all! Ryunosuke: It's an uncanny resemblance, isn't it? It makes my skin crawl to look at it... Iris: I know! But look, Runo. You can kick this Hurley, and he doesn't move a muscle! Ryunosuke: You can't go around kicking the exhibits, Iris! .........Wait. It, it just moved, I'm sure. And not just a little bit, either! Iris: Hm? Really? Did it? Ryunosuke: And look closely... ...there are beads of sweat on the face...of this waxwork... model... ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Sh-Shall we move on, Iris? ...Over there, look! There's a great murder scene to enjoy! Much more appealing. Sholmes: Sholmes: My dear fellow! I take exception to your recoiling in such a manner, as if you've seen something truly abhorrent! Ryunosuke: Mr...Mr Sholmes! (I knew it!) Sholmes: Iris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Temporary waxwork? What do you mean? Sholmes: And that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me! Iris: But Runo has something he needs to ask you. Sholmes: Ah...a question? Iris: And I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are! Sholmes: Hm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax! Ryunosuke: ...Thank goodness we arrived in time. Sholmes: Indeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss! Iris: Oh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you? Ryunosuke: (He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.) Sholmes: Now that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing! Ryunosuke: Oh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry. Sholmes: And if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken. Ryunosuke: Really? Sholmes: Moreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now. Ryunosuke: (But...how could it be?) Sholmes: We shall speak again presently, my dear fellow. But for now, I must return to my work. Ryunosuke: (What, back to being a temporary waxwork exhibit?) Sholmes: ......... Well? What is it you'd like to ask me, then? Ryunosuke: Um. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks. Sholmes: Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust? And so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together. Ryunosuke: So I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person. Iris: I was sure that you'd know, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: You said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Sholmes...? (He's suddenly clammed up.) Sholmes: Well, it seems we've reached the unavoida- ???: Greetings... Ryunosuke: Oh! Ah...hello. (Where did she appear from? And what's she wearing? Could she look any more mysterious?) ???: I hope...you are appreciating my museum? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- (Not again!) Tusspells: My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork. Ryunosuke: Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Bien s\u00fbr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add. Ryunosuke: ...Is that significant somehow? Tusspells: I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi. Ryunosuke: Right... Tusspells: Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular. Ryunosuke: (That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.) Tusspells: I was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble. Iris: She sounds deadly serious. Ryunosuke: (That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?) Iris: Let's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean. Ryunosuke: Yes, I know, but... Iris: I'm so curious! I want to know what's happening here! Ryunosuke: (Haven't we got enough on our plate already?!) Ryunosuke: Um, I wonder...could I ask you something? Tusspells: Bien s\u00fbr... Ryunosuke: I'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. [sic] Some kind of incident, perhaps? Tusspells: ......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you? Ryunosuke: Oh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! (He's disappeared!) ???: ...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade. Ryunosuke: Ah! Th-There you are! Tusspells: Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down? Sholmes: My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead! Tusspells: ...! Sholmes: Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police. Tusspells: Why ever not?! Ryunosuke: (She's turned as white as a sheet...) Sholmes: Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance! Tusspells: ......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we? Sholmes: Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain? Tusspells: That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it. Sholmes: Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder? Tusspells: Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there! Sholmes: Nothing amiss, madame? What about the arm protruding ominously from under the curtain? Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens. Tusspells: ......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soup\u00e7on. Sholmes: I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak graveyard scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is nowhere to be seen. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor. Ryunosuke: Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself! Sholmes: I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit. Tusspells: Why...? Why would you say that? Sholmes: And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime! Tusspells: AAAAAAH! Ryunosuke: (She looks as pale as candle wax...) Tusspells: I, I don't understand... Sholmes: So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! 'Waxwork for sale'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold the infamous killer - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds! Tusspells: Nooooooooon! Sholmes: Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively. Tusspells: What are you suggesting?! Sholmes: He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret... Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Topic 2 Waxwork Location Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Such as is worn by policemen as a secret sign to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay. Tusspells: What are you talking about? Sholmes: The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards. Tusspells: But... Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame? Tusspells: I, I do not... Sholmes: Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ......... Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: I see I've stunned you all into silence. Iris: You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot... Ryunosuke: Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly ruthless murderer, wouldn't it? Sholmes: ......... The killer policeman, Ottermole. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether. Iris: And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole! Ryunosuke: So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be? Sholmes: Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well. Ryunosuke: But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model? Sholmes: It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective? Ryunosuke: S-So...it is quite a lot then. Tusspells: ......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down. Ryunosuke: (That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...) Iris: Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions... Iris: Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight! Ryunosuke: Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger! Sholmes: Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Ryunosuke: She definitely looked in this direction, it's true. Iris: But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds. Ryunosuke: Oh? Iris: She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything. Ryunosuke: ......... (For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.) W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance. Iris: Let's follow that furtive glance again and see if there's anything else that could explain it! The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Iris: Judging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all. Ryunosuke: (The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...) But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure. Iris: ...Then let's have more of a look around! Ryunosuke: The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note! Sholmes: Quite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork. Tusspells: Agh! Sholmes: Two hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it. Tusspells: The model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have... Sholmes: In summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is ransom money! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: So if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is? Iris: We could just ask him when he comes around. Ryunosuke: ...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris. Iris: Yes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down. Ryunosuke: Well, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around... What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious. Iris: Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?! Ryunosuke: ...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. (Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...) Ryunosuke: What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand! Sholmes: Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow. Tusspells: How, how could you...? Ryunosuke: The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's a left hand. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model! Tusspells: KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage. Ryunosuke: So you mean, that arm...? Tusspells: Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir. Sholmes: Hm, no small keepsake. Ryunosuke: Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms... Tusspells: I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson. Ryunosuke: You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back. Sholmes: And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our conclusion: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Kidnapped! Solved Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is a sign to other policemen that some crime is underway. Iris: A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard. Ryunosuke: ...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away. Iris: Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course. Ryunosuke: Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible. Iris: But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean... Ryunosuke: ...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet. Ryunosuke: Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub. Sholmes: No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model! Ryunosuke: I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes. Tusspells: He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man. Sholmes: Naturally! What other explanation could there be? Ryunosuke: And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it? Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Ryunosuke: A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known? Iris: It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money. Ryunosuke: (Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...) So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really? Iris: Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Iris: If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not. Ryunosuke: Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think? Iris: Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail. Ryunosuke: (If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...) Ryunosuke: The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch! Sholmes: Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard! Ryunosuke: ...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then... Sholmes: And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep. Ryunosuke: But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence? Sholmes: No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes! The secret sign used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway. Tusspells: Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such criminal activity happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective. Sholmes: So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth. Ryunosuke: The waxwork of the especially ruthless killer from the special exhibit has been kidnapped. Sholmes: And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Still a mystery! Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Tusspells: All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe. Sholmes: It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted? Tusspells: ......... Yes. Tragically, it was... Sholmes: Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please. Tusspells: ...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work. Sholmes: ......... The talents of a great detective could be put to better use, I feel, but as you wish... Tusspells: It was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death. Sholmes: And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction. Ryunosuke: But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks? Sholmes: ......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to the victims he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest. Iris: What do you mean, Hurley? Sholmes: Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration. Ryunosuke: Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with noble blood! Iris: Oh gosh! Sholmes: It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks. Ryunosuke: No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?! Sholmes: I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today. Ryunosuke: ......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past... Sholmes: Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit. Tusspells: I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you. ???: ...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here. Harebrayne: It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok. Van Zieks: It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places. Harebrayne: I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen... Van Zieks: ......... Tomorrow the court will decide. Harebrayne: Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it! Van Zieks: I must warn you... Harebrayne: Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you? Van Zieks: ...Yes. Harebrayne: ......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...? Van Zieks: What? Harebrayne: ......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart. Van Zieks: My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else. Harebrayne: Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok. Van Zieks: Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court.

And it's set on a background of a sunflower design. ...Or was it a dandelion? ...Or a chrysanthemum, perhaps... .........Well anyway, no one should be judged on their knowledge of flowers...or lack of it. Inside of armband Ryunosuke: The name of the armband's owner is very finely embroidered here. 'Kazuma Asogi'... One day, when I'm back in Japan and I've earned my official law qualification there... ...I'll wear one band on each arm. ...That should make me a very well-balanced lawyer, I suppose.Ryunosuke: (I can't believe it's been six months since I was last allowed to work in court. And now here I am, back at the Old Bailey...)Harebrayne: Ah! M-Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Good morning, Professor Harebrayne.Harebrayne: I, I don't understand! It doesn't make any sense! The atmospheric pressure in here is off the charts! I've never felt anything like it! It's, it's crushing me!Ryunosuke: I feel it every time I'm here. That...gravity.Harebrayne: Well, this is Britain's highest court... But are you telling me it's filled with some kind of device that can actually control air pressure?!Ryunosuke: ......... I think it's probably all in the mind.Harebrayne: Ah. Yes, well...you won't let me down, will you, Mr Naruhodo? I'm counting on you in today's trial...to save my life! To save the secret of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine from being made public!Ryunosuke: Yes, I understand. (I know what I have to do. I have to establish that the explosion two days ago was nothing more than an unfortunate accident.)Harebrayne: Well, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, really. Justice will prevail!???: My commiserations, Mr Naruhodo. You appear to have been lumbered with a most tiresome case here.Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! I didn't expect to see you here.Iris: That was very mean, Runo, leaving me alone at home with Hurley. It took me at least an hour to wake him!Harebrayne: Ah... Oh... Ah... Is it...? Are you...? HEEEEEERLOCK SHOOOOOOLMES?!Sholmes: Indeed, sir. I am he. Heeeeeerlock Shoooooolmes.Harebrayne: Oh, I've heard all about your exploits, even whilst living in Germany.Iris: Ah yes. Randst Magazine is on sale in Germany, too.Harebrayne: This month's instalment was sublime! Your deduction in 'The Adventure of Silver Blaze' was wonderful!Sholmes: Ah yes, a memorable case indeed. It concerned a snake, I seem to recall.Iris: No, that was 'The Speckled Band.'Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for coming. I do appreciate your support.Sholmes: I'm sorry to disappoint you, my dear fellow, but I'm afraid I can't stay.Ryunosuke: Oh.Sholmes: I have urgent business at Madame Tusspells.Ryunosuke: You mean...your waxwork job?Sholmes: No no, the waxwork abduction, of course. Madame has engaged my services.Ryunosuke: Ah, so you're trying to get to the bottom of that ransom note, are you?Sholmes: The week's wages depend on it! ...As does the safe return of the waxwork, naturally. As such, I intend to give it my undivided attention.Ryunosuke: Oh, well, never mind then. I understand.Sholmes: Of course, with my skills of observation and reasoning, resolving the matter will be as easy as proverbial pie. I shall return forthwith. For until I solve the case, I shall have no money to afford a pie of any description.Iris: Ooh, then you must absolutely give it your full attention, Hurley!Sholmes: Quite, Iris, quite. But life is riddled with irony, you know. Whenever I give something my full attention, I have a quite insatiable desire for a pie. One of the universe's intractable mysteries, you might say.Harebrayne: Oh yes! Quite! Definitely! Absolutely! I totally understand!Ryunosuke: (...Is someone a little starstruck?)Sholmes: I wish you the very best of luck, Professor Harebrayne.Harebrayne: Oh! Ah! Ooh! Why, thank you!Sholmes: Before I depart, Mr Naruhodo...a word in your ear, if you please?Ryunosuke: ...? What's this about?Sholmes: As you have remarkably little grounding in science, I feel I ought to inform you... As compelling as this 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis' hypothesis may be... ...a practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible.Ryunosuke: But, but the professor said the demonstration was a success!Sholmes: Yes, it would appear that he fervently believes it was.Iris: I've read Professor Bunnybrain's paper about it, too, Runo. And I have to say... ...I'm sure it can't be done. It could barely be done theoretically, let alone practically.Ryunosuke: (So he's completely barking up the wrong tree?) But how could an experiment that had no possibility of succeeding in fact succeed? That's contradictory.Sholmes: And it's that contradiction that will be at the heart of the trial, I've no doubt.Ryunosuke: (What's that supposed to mean?)Sholmes: Now, I must hurry along. I wish you the best of luck, my dear fellow.Iris: See you later, Hurley! Well, it looks like you're on your own today, Runo. But chin up! You can do it!Ryunosuke: Oh! What about you, Iris?Iris: Ah, no, I'm afraid I can't help. I have something I need to do.Ryunosuke: ...I see.Iris: Hehe! It's going to be a big surprise for you when you find out what it is!Ryunosuke: Haah... (That sounds ominous...)Bailiff: Counsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Make your way into the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke: We're on our way! (An experiment that the laws of science say can't possibly succeed... ...and a scientist who's convinced that it did. That's the riddle you have to unlock here, Ryunosuke! That's the key to this case!)23rd October, 9:10 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are sitting today for the public trial of Professor Albert Harebrayne. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready.Ryunosuke: The defence is... The defence is ready, My Lord! ......... (I'm six months out of practice. And what's more... ...I'm without Susato-san today.) ......... (Ugh... Is it just my imagination, or does the air in here feel even more oppressive than usual?)Judge: So... ...I must say I recollect the victim of this case all too well. Mr Odie Asman.Van Zieks: Mr Asman was well known as a financier...though that was merely a front for his diverse criminal activities.Judge: It was only a month ago that the man appeared in court prosecuted by you, Lord van Zieks. But the jury unanimously found him not guilty.Ryunosuke: (Because every member of the jury had been bribed, by the sound of it. These powerful London criminals are prepared to go to extreme lengths to keep their freedom.)Judge: But two days ago, on 21st October, Mr Asman met his end. The work of the Reaper, was it?Van Zieks: ......... If that is how Your Lordship would describe divine retribution... But the fact remains that Mr Asman's death... ...was a direct result of the actions of the accused, Professor Harebrayne.Judge: Very well, then. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... You have been selected at random to represent the will of the people. Are the six of you ready to fulfil your societal duty?Juror No. 1: I'm most gratified to have been selected to carry out this important civic duty, My Lord.Juror No. 2: To have a man's fate in the palm of one's hand... Oh gosh! Oh golly! It sends shivers down my spine.Juror No. 3: Science experiments, magic, conjuring tricks, courtroom trials... All are nothing more than performances.Juror No. 4: Any spurious scholar that defiles the reputation of science deserves to hang!Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?Juror No. 6: ......... Wasn't like this in my day! Wasn't like this at all!Ryunosuke: ......... (That's...that's... ...the police killer Ottermole look-alike...again. And he's as exhausted as ever, it seems.)Judge: Now, as I'm sure you are all aware... ...the incident we are here to judge today tragically took place at the Great Exhibition, shortly after its opening.Van Zieks: Though the death toll could have been far worse. With the exception of the victim, no one was killed. Nevertheless, the dream of the science being exhibited rapidly turned into a nightmare for the spectators.Judge: A tragic turn of events. And as such, the eyes of all London- No, of the whole world will be on this trial. It is our duty to reach a swift and just conclusion, I feel. So...your opening statement please, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks: At the heart of this incident... ...is technology never before demonstrated anywhere in the world.Judge: One of science's latest developments, I take it? The government is keen to capitalise on the Great Exhibition to improve Britain's technological advantage.Van Zieks: The technology being demonstrated by the accused was described as 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis'.Judge: Good Lord!Ryunosuke: It's designed to 'disassemble' human subjects using extremely high-voltage electricity... ...and 'beam' them instantly to another location where they are subsequently reassembled.Judge: Is...is such a thing even within the realms of possibility?Juror No. 1: Well I don't believe it, that's for sure.Juror No. 2: Disassembling people with electricity? My goodness! How shocking!Juror No. 4: Hah! The whole idea is absurd! The hypothesis would never stand up to scrutiny!Judge: Sir, I believe you are a fellow of the Royal Society, are you not? An expert in your field?Juror No. 4: I am, and my word on the matter can be considered final. Instantaneous kinesis is poppycock!Ryunosuke: (So this expert and Mr Sholmes are in agreement. It's impossible...)Judge: What is the prosecution's view on the matter?Van Zieks: ......... The prosecution would assert... ...that the accused's instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a success.Ryunosuke: What?!Juror No. 4: What rot!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar!Van Zieks: The professor's hypothesis is currently under investigation by the British government. If it is deemed to have merit, a substantial research grant would be made available. The accused made use of the invention built on his new hypothesis to take Mr Asman's life... ...in order to be the sole benefactor of the grant.Ryunosuke: But, but...Van Zieks: This disastrous demonstration was no accident. It was carefully designed from the outset to end the life of the victim.Judge: Thank you, Lord van Zieks. The prosecution's stance is clear. But you will now bring forth witnesses to substantiate your claims.Van Zieks: ...Gladly, My Lord. Bailiff! Show the first witnesses to the stand!Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court.Gregson: Yes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division. I was on duty at the demonstration on the day in question and in charge of the followin' investigation.Harebrayne: ......... Albert Harebrayne! S-S-Scientist!Van Zieks: You were born in England, but have been carrying out research in Germany in recent years. Correct?Harebrayne: Yes. Yes, that's right. After graduating from university here in Britain, I went to work in Germany...and made an amazing discovery! Which is what brought me back! I had to demonstrate my incredible hypothesis at the Great Exhibition!Gregson: What you demonstrated was incredible alright. An incredible explosion!Harebrayne: But the science! The science was a success! The instantaneous kinesis worked! E-Everyone saw it! They must have done! Yes, there was the terrible accident, but... ...the demonstration of my hypothesis was a success!Gregson: Well, that much is undeniable. As shown in this photograph taken by the Forensic Investigation Team.Judge: This was taken inside the Crystal Tower, I take it? The centrepiece of the exhibition, no less.Gregson: That's right, My Lord. Seems the victim rammed straight into it.Judge: Hm, I see... Very well, submit the photograph as evidence.The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record.Gregson: As the court's heard, the victim of the incident was Mr Odie Asman. There have been a number of allegations made against the man, but puttin' them aside for the time bein'... ...he was the man who financed the research for the experiment and the demonstration itself.Judge: I see. So to summarise the situation... ...the defendant is accused of taking the life of the man who funded his work. Would that be correct?Gregson: Exactly.Ryunosuke: But couldn't it be... ...that the explosion was caused by some malfunction in the apparatus used for the demonstration?Harebrayne: That's right! That must be it! My splendid machine... My poor, splendid machine...Gregson: You saw it yesterday, didn't you? We can't even examine the wreckage thanks to the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act.Harebrayne: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! The wreckage?! THE WRECKAGE?!Judge: But that being the case, how can the facts be established? How can it possibly be determined whether this was an accident or a deliberate and malicious act?Van Zieks: Extremely simply, My Lord.Judge: I beg your pardon?Van Zieks: Isn't that right, witness?Harebrayne: Wha...? Sorry? ME?!Van Zieks: No. Your neighbour.Gregson: Yes, sir! It was murder, plain and simple. Anyone could state that with complete certainty.Ryunosuke: What?! (How can he possibly think that?)Judge: Thank you, Inspector. I think we had better proceed to formal testimony. You will explain to the court on what grounds you claim this experiment to have been a front for murder!Witness Testimony - A Front for Murder -Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck.Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake!Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!Judge: ......... An extraordinary business... In addition to suffering a broken neck, the victim was stabbed in the heart?Ryunosuke: (Information I would really like to have heard from someone other than the judge...)Gregson: The coroner says death would have been all but instant from a wound like that.Van Zieks: You could say, in fact... ...that the victim was killed twice by the accused.Harebrayne: No, no and no! That couldn't be further from the truth!Gregson: I have here the experiment plan document that was submitted to the security team. The victim stood himself inside somethin' called 'the birdcage', ready to be 'beamed' instantly... ...to the second level of the Crystal Tower, about twenty-five yards away.Van Zieks: The experiment did not go according to plan, however. As the machine was put into operation, there was a large explosion. The blast caused the beam transmitter to point higher than intended. Accordingly, the kinesis resulted in the birdcage materialising in mid-air... ...from where it subsequently fell, crashing through the glass of the Crystal Tower's large round window.Judge: My word... One assumes the victim's neck was broken upon impact with the tower, then?Harebrayne: I'm, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen! The machine was just too powerful! But honestly! Really! I swear! It was just an accident! A terrible accident!Van Zieks: Unfortunately, that excuse can't save you.Gregson: No, not considerin' the sharp murder weapon that pierced the victim's heart.Harebrayne: M-Murder weapon?! What are you saying?!Van Zieks: This is the autopsy report submitted by the coroner. The prosecution would like it entered into the Court Record.Judge: Your request is granted, Counsel.The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.Juror No. 4: I was there in person, you know. I saw the whole ludicrous performance. And the only other person on the stage with Mr Asman was that disgraceful excuse for a scientist!Juror No. 2: Then really, by all accounts it must have been him.Juror No. 1: Hmph. Hard to think otherwise, really.Judge: Very well. Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination, please.Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, My Lord! (I need to focus here... It's been a while!)Cross-Examination - A Front for Murder -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

The testimonies are from Gregson and Harebrayne, and the evidence includes various items like the Autopsy Report, Photograph of the Victim, Screwdriver, etc.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Testimony 3 by Gregson states that the victim had a lesion in his chest from being stabbed by something sharp. The evidence includes the Autopsy Report (6) which mentions both a broken neck and a stab wound. The Screwdriver (7) has blood matching the wound. \n\nWait, but the key contradiction might be about the weapon being left in the body. Testimony 5 by Gregson says the weapon must have been left in the body when beamed. However, the evidence Screwdriver (7) was found in the machine's wreckage, not in the victim. So if the weapon was left in the body, how did it end up in the machine? That's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and the location of the Screwdriver. \n\nSo Testimony 5 claims the weapon was in the victim's body during beaming, but Evidence 7 shows the weapon was found elsewhere.

Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light. Rendered dialogue We're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment! Ladies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you! 22nd October, 9:36 a.m. Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ...Runo! Runo, are you listening? Ryunosuke: Oh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris? Iris: Hmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast? Ryunosuke: No no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again? Iris: Today's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again! Ryunosuke: Ah yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. ......... Iris: You're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Iris: Oh gosh! You're even more down! Sholmes: ......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together. Sholmes: What?! Why didn't you mention it before? Ryunosuke: I, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast? Sholmes: Hm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence. Ryunosuke: (...Thanks.) Sholmes: Of course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations. Ryunosuke: What?! Sholmes: Let's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that- Ryunosuke: Um, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact. Sholmes: Oh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks again.) ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now. Iris: Six months? Ryunosuke: Since I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned. Iris: Oh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Ryunosuke: (Ah...back to moping...) Ryunosuke: What's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me. Iris: I know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together? Sholmes: I want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being. Ryunosuke: Why not? Sholmes: Why not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all! Ryunosuke: (So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?) Iris: I don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: (I suppose I should try to find out what's going on.) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Well, I must be leaving now. Ryunosuke: Yes, understood. See you later, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Hah! You really are a shameless liar sometimes, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: You seek to put me off my guard and follow me, don't you? Well, you would be wasting your time. Ryunosuke: The thought hadn't crossed my mind! (But now I'm wondering where you're going...) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha hah! Well then, 'see you later' indeed! Ryunosuke: (Listen to him. He's still laughing on his way out of the door...) Iris: Alright then, Runo! Let's get going! Ryunosuke: Oh! Um, Iris... What are you wearing? Iris: I've got changed to go to the Great Exhibition. You're going to take me! Ryunosuke: What? But, but I was just about to go to the Supreme Court... Iris: Oh! Well that sounds fun, too! You're going to take me there, then! Ryunosuke: Alright, fine. Just...lower that weapon, would you? Iris: Of course! And after the Supreme Court, then we'll go to see the Great Exhibition! 22nd October Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: It's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. (It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...) Iris: Oh, I love this place! I always find so many interesting books here! Ryunosuke: Of course. I was forgetting that you've been here before. (The time we came here six months ago... ...when Susato-san was given the news that she was to return to Japan.) ???: Ah. I understand you wish to speak with me. Ryunosuke: Oh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well? Stronghart: Let's see... Since you've arrived and requested an audience, it's been four hours, thirty-two minutes and... ...twenty-six seconds. I've kept you waiting a while. My apologies. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all! I like nothing more than standing around, staring into space. Stronghart: ...Good to know. Ryunosuke: (...Good to know that doesn't appear to bother him at all.) Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of London. He's the man who allowed me to start practising as a defence lawyer when I arrived in Britain as a student. You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status. Stronghart: As you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: Oh...I've not heard about that. Stronghart: Investigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it. Ryunosuke: (...Well, it's nice to know where I stand.) Stronghart: So...you wish to consult with me? Of course, I can very well imagine what this is about. Ryunosuke: Ah...well, um... Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, My Lord! (I want to be allowed to start working as a defence lawyer again in court. That's what brought me here today. But actually, there's something else playing on my mind, as it happens...) Iris: Runo, just take a deep breath and come out with it! After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: Well, I must be leaving for my next engagement. I'm already...eleven hours and sixteen minutes late. ...My colleagues may be starting to fidget. Ryunosuke: E-Eleven hours late? That's...quite something. Stronghart: That meeting had already started when I arrived back here for this engagement with you. So lateness was inevitable. Time stops for no man. Ryunosuke: (I'm sure it stopped for me during those twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three reasons...) Oh, yes! Where would I find Lord van Zieks now? Stronghart: I would assume he's at his office. Ryunosuke: (Right, I'll go and ask him about the attack in person. I want to get this straight from the horse's mouth...) Stronghart: Away with you now. I'm leaving Professor Harebrayne's defence entirely in your hands. Ryunosuke: Of, of course, yes! Thank you very much, My Lord! 22nd October Prosecutor's Office Iris: Ooh! So this is the legendary Reaper's office? Ryunosuke: Yes, it appears so. Iris: Brrr, it sends a chill down your spine, doesn't it? What an amazingly deathly atmosphere! Ryunosuke: ...Oh, is that...? (That hooded figure was so still, I hadn't noticed his or her presence. I wonder who it is...?) ???: What are you doing here? Ryunosuke: Agh! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (He's as unwelcoming as I thought he'd be. Actually, maybe even more so...) Oh, I, um... I'm glad to see you're well. Van Zieks: ...I am. Ryunosuke: ......... So...who's the person over by the wall being...punished for something or other? Van Zieks: No punishment is taking place here. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: That's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will. Ryunosuke: I didn't know you had an apprentice. (It must be the same person who was pictured in the newspaper...) Van Zieks: He's very able in combat. ...A requisite skill for anyone under my tutelage. Ryunosuke: Are you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers? Van Zieks: The Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms... After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: Ah yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you... Ryunosuke: Oh! What's that? Van Zieks: That Nipponese man. Is he faring well? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: The one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters. Ryunosuke: Ah! Mr Natsume, you mean? Iris: ...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo. Ryunosuke: He's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day. Van Zieks: I see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. (I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.) Iris: I never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books! Ryunosuke: A mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? (Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.) 22nd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: The warden said cell eleven. That's this one... Iris: Oh! There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look! Ryunosuke: What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: ...! Who are you? Ryunosuke: I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer. Harebrayne: A LAWYER! Ryunosuke: Agh! (Was it something I said?!) Harebrayne: A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?! Ryunosuke: Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't- Harebrayne: Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah... Ryunosuke: ......... (Now's probably not a good time to mention that your zeal made my concentration leave for a while, too...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: So, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct? Harebrayne: As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life! Ryunosuke: ......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Harebrayne: ......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything. Ryunosuke: Thank you for that, Professor. Harebrayne: And thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court! Iris: Alright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: Well, that's where the incident happened, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, I suppose that's true. (Time to investigate at last!) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Ryunosuke: Ugh... The showgrounds are a little too big for my liking... We've been walking around in dense crowds for two hours now, and I've felt myself swooning three times. Iris: There are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too! Ryunosuke: ...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. (We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.) ???: .........! ???: .........! Ryunosuke: (What's that...? I can hear voices from up on the stage. It sounds like an argument...) ???: Right, I've had it with you this time! I'm warnin' you, I'll arrest you in a minute! ???: Oh yeah? Go on then, 'Spector, give it a shot! You ain't got no evidence, an' you know it! Ryunosuke: (Wait... I know those voices.) ???: You've got a cheeky little mouth on you, young lady! But a night in the cells will teach you some manners! ???: Just try it, I dare ya! If ya want that bag o' chips rammed down yer throat! Iris: Yoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there? Gregson: ......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship? Ryunosuke: (...Does that make her three times a lady?) Iris: I'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue. Gregson: Unbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you! Ryunosuke: Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. (But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!) Gregson: Watch it, sunshine! Ryunosuke: S-Sorry... Gregson: What gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case? Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm acting for the defence. Iris: So we're here to investigate! Gregson: Hmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it? Ryunosuke: (Is it really that troubling?) ???: Tsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo! Ryunosuke: Wha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is! ???: Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob. Ryunosuke: This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court. Gina: Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya? Ryunosuke: I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground. Gina: That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's Inspector Lestrade now! Ryunosuke: In... Inspector?! (That badge is homemade, surely...) Gregson: The 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us. Iris: What's that supposed to mean? Gregson: Right, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright? Gina: Right...sir. Ryunosuke: (This... This raises a LOT of questions!) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Iris: Runo, Runo, listen! Ryunosuke: What? What is it? Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like? Ryunosuke: No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow! Iris: But that's where Hurley is. Ryunosuke: What? At, at this popular London attraction? Iris: Yes! Ryunosuke: How is it that you know where he is? Iris: Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Ryunosuke: So that's it, is it? The machine that blew up. Iris: Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share. Ryunosuke: You've seen things like this before, you mean? Iris: Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!' Ryunosuke: Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs. Iris: One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof. Iris: Well anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate! Ryunosuke: Ah look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully. Iris: Really? He just looks confused to me. Ryunosuke: It ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it? Iris: Magnificently...and mercilessly. Ryunosuke: So someone stands in the middle of the machine to be disassembled and then 'beamed' through the air... Iris: Yes, 'beamed' not 'blasted'. That's the point. Ryunosuke: (Yes, that part's crucial, really.) Is something like that even possible, though, Iris? Iris: Oh, Runo. I'm just a child. How should I know? Ryunosuke: (A child when it suits you, you mean...) Iris: From what I can tell, I think if you were to pull this lever here- Gregson: STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! Don't touch that! Iris: Ah ha ha! That was practically instantaneous kinesis the way you flew over just now, Gregsy! Gregson: Please, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here. Iris: So sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it. Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful! Ryunosuke: (It's just like old times, this is...) We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene! Gregson: Hah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, that special dispensation... (The professor mentioned that, too.) Gregson: More red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes. Iris: But...we're allowed to just look, aren't we? Gregson: Eh? Iris: Surely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy? Gregson: ......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! Anythin' you say, Your Ladyship! But please don't get your dainty hands dirty, will you? Iris: Don't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo? Ryunosuke: (She really knows how to get what she wants...) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Gregson: Right, are you done here, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gregson: Isn't it about time you were leavin'? Or rather...it IS about time you were leavin'! That lot are here now. Iris: That lot? Gregson: The Forensic Investigation Team. They'll be givin' me the heave-ho in a minute, too. Iris: Oh dear. Poor Gregsy. Here! Have another cup of my special blend to cheer you up! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! That hit the spot! Yup, hits it every time! Ryunosuke: (Well, at least I've seen the scene with my own eyes. It looks like this is as far as we're going to get with our investigations here at least...) Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this?

(I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) Prosecutor's Office Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Ryunosuke: Wh-What is this place? L-Look at all these t-terrifying scenes! But why are all the p-people so still? (Guillotines... Ruthless murderers... I know what I'll be dreaming about tonight.) Iris: They're all wax models. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked? Ryunosuke: W-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere! Iris: ...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif- Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Iris: What now? Ryunosuke: I've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display. Iris: None of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas. Ryunosuke: They can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them! Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: There's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait. Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: Oh...no... (I must be seeing things...) Ryunosuke: It's...it's... ...the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! (Mr Sholmes has his own wax statue in here? Really?) Iris: Well he is world-famous, after all! Ryunosuke: It's an uncanny resemblance, isn't it? It makes my skin crawl to look at it... Iris: I know! But look, Runo. You can kick this Hurley, and he doesn't move a muscle! Ryunosuke: You can't go around kicking the exhibits, Iris! .........Wait. It, it just moved, I'm sure. And not just a little bit, either! Iris: Hm? Really? Did it? Ryunosuke: And look closely... ...there are beads of sweat on the face...of this waxwork... model... ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Sh-Shall we move on, Iris? ...Over there, look! There's a great murder scene to enjoy! Much more appealing. Sholmes: Sholmes: My dear fellow! I take exception to your recoiling in such a manner, as if you've seen something truly abhorrent! Ryunosuke: Mr...Mr Sholmes! (I knew it!) Sholmes: Iris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Temporary waxwork? What do you mean? Sholmes: And that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me! Iris: But Runo has something he needs to ask you. Sholmes: Ah...a question? Iris: And I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are! Sholmes: Hm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax! Ryunosuke: ...Thank goodness we arrived in time. Sholmes: Indeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss! Iris: Oh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you? Ryunosuke: (He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.) Sholmes: Now that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing! Ryunosuke: Oh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry. Sholmes: And if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken. Ryunosuke: Really? Sholmes: Moreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now. Ryunosuke: (But...how could it be?) Sholmes: We shall speak again presently, my dear fellow. But for now, I must return to my work. Ryunosuke: (What, back to being a temporary waxwork exhibit?) Sholmes: ......... Well? What is it you'd like to ask me, then? Ryunosuke: Um. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks. Sholmes: Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust? And so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together. Ryunosuke: So I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person. Iris: I was sure that you'd know, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: You said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Sholmes...? (He's suddenly clammed up.) Sholmes: Well, it seems we've reached the unavoida- ???: Greetings... Ryunosuke: Oh! Ah...hello. (Where did she appear from? And what's she wearing? Could she look any more mysterious?) ???: I hope...you are appreciating my museum? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- (Not again!) Tusspells: My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork. Ryunosuke: Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Bien s\u00fbr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add. Ryunosuke: ...Is that significant somehow? Tusspells: I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi. Ryunosuke: Right... Tusspells: Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular. Ryunosuke: (That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.) Tusspells: I was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble. Iris: She sounds deadly serious. Ryunosuke: (That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?) Iris: Let's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean. Ryunosuke: Yes, I know, but... Iris: I'm so curious! I want to know what's happening here! Ryunosuke: (Haven't we got enough on our plate already?!) Ryunosuke: Um, I wonder...could I ask you something? Tusspells: Bien s\u00fbr... Ryunosuke: I'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. [sic] Some kind of incident, perhaps? Tusspells: ......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you? Ryunosuke: Oh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! (He's disappeared!) ???: ...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade. Ryunosuke: Ah! Th-There you are! Tusspells: Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down? Sholmes: My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead! Tusspells: ...! Sholmes: Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police. Tusspells: Why ever not?! Ryunosuke: (She's turned as white as a sheet...) Sholmes: Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance! Tusspells: ......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we? Sholmes: Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain? Tusspells: That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it. Sholmes: Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder? Tusspells: Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there! Sholmes: Nothing amiss, madame? What about the arm protruding ominously from under the curtain? Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens. Tusspells: ......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soup\u00e7on. Sholmes: I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak graveyard scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is nowhere to be seen. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor. Ryunosuke: Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself! Sholmes: I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit. Tusspells: Why...? Why would you say that? Sholmes: And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime! Tusspells: AAAAAAH! Ryunosuke: (She looks as pale as candle wax...) Tusspells: I, I don't understand... Sholmes: So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! 'Waxwork for sale'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold the infamous killer - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds! Tusspells: Nooooooooon! Sholmes: Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively. Tusspells: What are you suggesting?! Sholmes: He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret... Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Topic 2 Waxwork Location Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Such as is worn by policemen as a secret sign to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay. Tusspells: What are you talking about? Sholmes: The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards. Tusspells: But... Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame? Tusspells: I, I do not... Sholmes: Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ......... Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: I see I've stunned you all into silence. Iris: You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot... Ryunosuke: Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly ruthless murderer, wouldn't it? Sholmes: ......... The killer policeman, Ottermole. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether. Iris: And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole! Ryunosuke: So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be? Sholmes: Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well. Ryunosuke: But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model? Sholmes: It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective? Ryunosuke: S-So...it is quite a lot then. Tusspells: ......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down. Ryunosuke: (That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...) Iris: Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions... Iris: Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight! Ryunosuke: Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger! Sholmes: Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Ryunosuke: She definitely looked in this direction, it's true. Iris: But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds. Ryunosuke: Oh? Iris: She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything. Ryunosuke: ......... (For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.) W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance. Iris: Let's follow that furtive glance again and see if there's anything else that could explain it! The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Iris: Judging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all. Ryunosuke: (The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...) But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure. Iris: ...Then let's have more of a look around! Ryunosuke: The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note! Sholmes: Quite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork. Tusspells: Agh! Sholmes: Two hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it. Tusspells: The model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have... Sholmes: In summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is ransom money! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: So if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is? Iris: We could just ask him when he comes around. Ryunosuke: ...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris. Iris: Yes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down. Ryunosuke: Well, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around... What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious. Iris: Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?! Ryunosuke: ...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. (Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...) Ryunosuke: What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand! Sholmes: Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow. Tusspells: How, how could you...? Ryunosuke: The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's a left hand. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model! Tusspells: KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage. Ryunosuke: So you mean, that arm...? Tusspells: Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir. Sholmes: Hm, no small keepsake. Ryunosuke: Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms... Tusspells: I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson. Ryunosuke: You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back. Sholmes: And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our conclusion: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Kidnapped! Solved Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is a sign to other policemen that some crime is underway. Iris: A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard. Ryunosuke: ...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away. Iris: Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course. Ryunosuke: Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible. Iris: But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean... Ryunosuke: ...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet. Ryunosuke: Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub. Sholmes: No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model! Ryunosuke: I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes. Tusspells: He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man. Sholmes: Naturally! What other explanation could there be? Ryunosuke: And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it? Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Ryunosuke: A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known? Iris: It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money. Ryunosuke: (Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...) So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really? Iris: Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Iris: If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not. Ryunosuke: Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think? Iris: Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail. Ryunosuke: (If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...) Ryunosuke: The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch! Sholmes: Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard! Ryunosuke: ...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then... Sholmes: And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep. Ryunosuke: But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence? Sholmes: No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes! The secret sign used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway. Tusspells: Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such criminal activity happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective. Sholmes: So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth. Ryunosuke: The waxwork of the especially ruthless killer from the special exhibit has been kidnapped. Sholmes: And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Still a mystery! Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Tusspells: All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe. Sholmes: It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted? Tusspells: ......... Yes. Tragically, it was... Sholmes: Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please. Tusspells: ...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work. Sholmes: ......... The talents of a great detective could be put to better use, I feel, but as you wish... Tusspells: It was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death. Sholmes: And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction. Ryunosuke: But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks? Sholmes: ......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to the victims he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest. Iris: What do you mean, Hurley? Sholmes: Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration. Ryunosuke: Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with noble blood! Iris: Oh gosh! Sholmes: It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks. Ryunosuke: No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?! Sholmes: I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today. Ryunosuke: ......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past... Sholmes: Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit. Tusspells: I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you. ???: ...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here. Harebrayne: It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok. Van Zieks: It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places. Harebrayne: I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen... Van Zieks: ......... Tomorrow the court will decide. Harebrayne: Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it! Van Zieks: I must warn you... Harebrayne: Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you? Van Zieks: ...Yes. Harebrayne: ......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...? Van Zieks: What? Harebrayne: ......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart. Van Zieks: My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else. Harebrayne: Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok. Van Zieks: Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court.

And it's set on a background of a sunflower design. ...Or was it a dandelion? ...Or a chrysanthemum, perhaps... .........Well anyway, no one should be judged on their knowledge of flowers...or lack of it. Inside of armband Ryunosuke: The name of the armband's owner is very finely embroidered here. 'Kazuma Asogi'... One day, when I'm back in Japan and I've earned my official law qualification there... ...I'll wear one band on each arm. ...That should make me a very well-balanced lawyer, I suppose.Ryunosuke: (I can't believe it's been six months since I was last allowed to work in court. And now here I am, back at the Old Bailey...)Harebrayne: Ah! M-Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Good morning, Professor Harebrayne.Harebrayne: I, I don't understand! It doesn't make any sense! The atmospheric pressure in here is off the charts! I've never felt anything like it! It's, it's crushing me!Ryunosuke: I feel it every time I'm here. That...gravity.Harebrayne: Well, this is Britain's highest court... But are you telling me it's filled with some kind of device that can actually control air pressure?!Ryunosuke: ......... I think it's probably all in the mind.Harebrayne: Ah. Yes, well...you won't let me down, will you, Mr Naruhodo? I'm counting on you in today's trial...to save my life! To save the secret of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine from being made public!Ryunosuke: Yes, I understand. (I know what I have to do. I have to establish that the explosion two days ago was nothing more than an unfortunate accident.)Harebrayne: Well, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, really. Justice will prevail!???: My commiserations, Mr Naruhodo. You appear to have been lumbered with a most tiresome case here.Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! I didn't expect to see you here.Iris: That was very mean, Runo, leaving me alone at home with Hurley. It took me at least an hour to wake him!Harebrayne: Ah... Oh... Ah... Is it...? Are you...? HEEEEEERLOCK SHOOOOOOLMES?!Sholmes: Indeed, sir. I am he. Heeeeeerlock Shoooooolmes.Harebrayne: Oh, I've heard all about your exploits, even whilst living in Germany.Iris: Ah yes. Randst Magazine is on sale in Germany, too.Harebrayne: This month's instalment was sublime! Your deduction in 'The Adventure of Silver Blaze' was wonderful!Sholmes: Ah yes, a memorable case indeed. It concerned a snake, I seem to recall.Iris: No, that was 'The Speckled Band.'Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for coming. I do appreciate your support.Sholmes: I'm sorry to disappoint you, my dear fellow, but I'm afraid I can't stay.Ryunosuke: Oh.Sholmes: I have urgent business at Madame Tusspells.Ryunosuke: You mean...your waxwork job?Sholmes: No no, the waxwork abduction, of course. Madame has engaged my services.Ryunosuke: Ah, so you're trying to get to the bottom of that ransom note, are you?Sholmes: The week's wages depend on it! ...As does the safe return of the waxwork, naturally. As such, I intend to give it my undivided attention.Ryunosuke: Oh, well, never mind then. I understand.Sholmes: Of course, with my skills of observation and reasoning, resolving the matter will be as easy as proverbial pie. I shall return forthwith. For until I solve the case, I shall have no money to afford a pie of any description.Iris: Ooh, then you must absolutely give it your full attention, Hurley!Sholmes: Quite, Iris, quite. But life is riddled with irony, you know. Whenever I give something my full attention, I have a quite insatiable desire for a pie. One of the universe's intractable mysteries, you might say.Harebrayne: Oh yes! Quite! Definitely! Absolutely! I totally understand!Ryunosuke: (...Is someone a little starstruck?)Sholmes: I wish you the very best of luck, Professor Harebrayne.Harebrayne: Oh! Ah! Ooh! Why, thank you!Sholmes: Before I depart, Mr Naruhodo...a word in your ear, if you please?Ryunosuke: ...? What's this about?Sholmes: As you have remarkably little grounding in science, I feel I ought to inform you... As compelling as this 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis' hypothesis may be... ...a practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible.Ryunosuke: But, but the professor said the demonstration was a success!Sholmes: Yes, it would appear that he fervently believes it was.Iris: I've read Professor Bunnybrain's paper about it, too, Runo. And I have to say... ...I'm sure it can't be done. It could barely be done theoretically, let alone practically.Ryunosuke: (So he's completely barking up the wrong tree?) But how could an experiment that had no possibility of succeeding in fact succeed? That's contradictory.Sholmes: And it's that contradiction that will be at the heart of the trial, I've no doubt.Ryunosuke: (What's that supposed to mean?)Sholmes: Now, I must hurry along. I wish you the best of luck, my dear fellow.Iris: See you later, Hurley! Well, it looks like you're on your own today, Runo. But chin up! You can do it!Ryunosuke: Oh! What about you, Iris?Iris: Ah, no, I'm afraid I can't help. I have something I need to do.Ryunosuke: ...I see.Iris: Hehe! It's going to be a big surprise for you when you find out what it is!Ryunosuke: Haah... (That sounds ominous...)Bailiff: Counsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Make your way into the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke: We're on our way! (An experiment that the laws of science say can't possibly succeed... ...and a scientist who's convinced that it did. That's the riddle you have to unlock here, Ryunosuke! That's the key to this case!)23rd October, 9:10 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are sitting today for the public trial of Professor Albert Harebrayne. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready.Ryunosuke: The defence is... The defence is ready, My Lord! ......... (I'm six months out of practice. And what's more... ...I'm without Susato-san today.) ......... (Ugh... Is it just my imagination, or does the air in here feel even more oppressive than usual?)Judge: So... ...I must say I recollect the victim of this case all too well. Mr Odie Asman.Van Zieks: Mr Asman was well known as a financier...though that was merely a front for his diverse criminal activities.Judge: It was only a month ago that the man appeared in court prosecuted by you, Lord van Zieks. But the jury unanimously found him not guilty.Ryunosuke: (Because every member of the jury had been bribed, by the sound of it. These powerful London criminals are prepared to go to extreme lengths to keep their freedom.)Judge: But two days ago, on 21st October, Mr Asman met his end. The work of the Reaper, was it?Van Zieks: ......... If that is how Your Lordship would describe divine retribution... But the fact remains that Mr Asman's death... ...was a direct result of the actions of the accused, Professor Harebrayne.Judge: Very well, then. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... You have been selected at random to represent the will of the people. Are the six of you ready to fulfil your societal duty?Juror No. 1: I'm most gratified to have been selected to carry out this important civic duty, My Lord.Juror No. 2: To have a man's fate in the palm of one's hand... Oh gosh! Oh golly! It sends shivers down my spine.Juror No. 3: Science experiments, magic, conjuring tricks, courtroom trials... All are nothing more than performances.Juror No. 4: Any spurious scholar that defiles the reputation of science deserves to hang!Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?Juror No. 6: ......... Wasn't like this in my day! Wasn't like this at all!Ryunosuke: ......... (That's...that's... ...the police killer Ottermole look-alike...again. And he's as exhausted as ever, it seems.)Judge: Now, as I'm sure you are all aware... ...the incident we are here to judge today tragically took place at the Great Exhibition, shortly after its opening.Van Zieks: Though the death toll could have been far worse. With the exception of the victim, no one was killed. Nevertheless, the dream of the science being exhibited rapidly turned into a nightmare for the spectators.Judge: A tragic turn of events. And as such, the eyes of all London- No, of the whole world will be on this trial. It is our duty to reach a swift and just conclusion, I feel. So...your opening statement please, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks: At the heart of this incident... ...is technology never before demonstrated anywhere in the world.Judge: One of science's latest developments, I take it? The government is keen to capitalise on the Great Exhibition to improve Britain's technological advantage.Van Zieks: The technology being demonstrated by the accused was described as 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis'.Judge: Good Lord!Ryunosuke: It's designed to 'disassemble' human subjects using extremely high-voltage electricity... ...and 'beam' them instantly to another location where they are subsequently reassembled.Judge: Is...is such a thing even within the realms of possibility?Juror No. 1: Well I don't believe it, that's for sure.Juror No. 2: Disassembling people with electricity? My goodness! How shocking!Juror No. 4: Hah! The whole idea is absurd! The hypothesis would never stand up to scrutiny!Judge: Sir, I believe you are a fellow of the Royal Society, are you not? An expert in your field?Juror No. 4: I am, and my word on the matter can be considered final. Instantaneous kinesis is poppycock!Ryunosuke: (So this expert and Mr Sholmes are in agreement. It's impossible...)Judge: What is the prosecution's view on the matter?Van Zieks: ......... The prosecution would assert... ...that the accused's instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a success.Ryunosuke: What?!Juror No. 4: What rot!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar!Van Zieks: The professor's hypothesis is currently under investigation by the British government. If it is deemed to have merit, a substantial research grant would be made available. The accused made use of the invention built on his new hypothesis to take Mr Asman's life... ...in order to be the sole benefactor of the grant.Ryunosuke: But, but...Van Zieks: This disastrous demonstration was no accident. It was carefully designed from the outset to end the life of the victim.Judge: Thank you, Lord van Zieks. The prosecution's stance is clear. But you will now bring forth witnesses to substantiate your claims.Van Zieks: ...Gladly, My Lord. Bailiff! Show the first witnesses to the stand!Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court.Gregson: Yes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division. I was on duty at the demonstration on the day in question and in charge of the followin' investigation.Harebrayne: ......... Albert Harebrayne! S-S-Scientist!Van Zieks: You were born in England, but have been carrying out research in Germany in recent years. Correct?Harebrayne: Yes. Yes, that's right. After graduating from university here in Britain, I went to work in Germany...and made an amazing discovery! Which is what brought me back! I had to demonstrate my incredible hypothesis at the Great Exhibition!Gregson: What you demonstrated was incredible alright. An incredible explosion!Harebrayne: But the science! The science was a success! The instantaneous kinesis worked! E-Everyone saw it! They must have done! Yes, there was the terrible accident, but... ...the demonstration of my hypothesis was a success!Gregson: Well, that much is undeniable. As shown in this photograph taken by the Forensic Investigation Team.Judge: This was taken inside the Crystal Tower, I take it? The centrepiece of the exhibition, no less.Gregson: That's right, My Lord. Seems the victim rammed straight into it.Judge: Hm, I see... Very well, submit the photograph as evidence.The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record.Gregson: As the court's heard, the victim of the incident was Mr Odie Asman. There have been a number of allegations made against the man, but puttin' them aside for the time bein'... ...he was the man who financed the research for the experiment and the demonstration itself.Judge: I see. So to summarise the situation... ...the defendant is accused of taking the life of the man who funded his work. Would that be correct?Gregson: Exactly.Ryunosuke: But couldn't it be... ...that the explosion was caused by some malfunction in the apparatus used for the demonstration?Harebrayne: That's right! That must be it! My splendid machine... My poor, splendid machine...Gregson: You saw it yesterday, didn't you? We can't even examine the wreckage thanks to the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act.Harebrayne: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! The wreckage?! THE WRECKAGE?!Judge: But that being the case, how can the facts be established? How can it possibly be determined whether this was an accident or a deliberate and malicious act?Van Zieks: Extremely simply, My Lord.Judge: I beg your pardon?Van Zieks: Isn't that right, witness?Harebrayne: Wha...? Sorry? ME?!Van Zieks: No. Your neighbour.Gregson: Yes, sir! It was murder, plain and simple. Anyone could state that with complete certainty.Ryunosuke: What?! (How can he possibly think that?)Judge: Thank you, Inspector. I think we had better proceed to formal testimony. You will explain to the court on what grounds you claim this experiment to have been a front for murder!Witness Testimony - A Front for Murder -Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck.Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake!Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!Judge: ......... An extraordinary business... In addition to suffering a broken neck, the victim was stabbed in the heart?Ryunosuke: (Information I would really like to have heard from someone other than the judge...)Gregson: The coroner says death would have been all but instant from a wound like that.Van Zieks: You could say, in fact... ...that the victim was killed twice by the accused.Harebrayne: No, no and no! That couldn't be further from the truth!Gregson: I have here the experiment plan document that was submitted to the security team. The victim stood himself inside somethin' called 'the birdcage', ready to be 'beamed' instantly... ...to the second level of the Crystal Tower, about twenty-five yards away.Van Zieks: The experiment did not go according to plan, however. As the machine was put into operation, there was a large explosion. The blast caused the beam transmitter to point higher than intended. Accordingly, the kinesis resulted in the birdcage materialising in mid-air... ...from where it subsequently fell, crashing through the glass of the Crystal Tower's large round window.Judge: My word... One assumes the victim's neck was broken upon impact with the tower, then?Harebrayne: I'm, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen! The machine was just too powerful! But honestly! Really! I swear! It was just an accident! A terrible accident!Van Zieks: Unfortunately, that excuse can't save you.Gregson: No, not considerin' the sharp murder weapon that pierced the victim's heart.Harebrayne: M-Murder weapon?! What are you saying?!Van Zieks: This is the autopsy report submitted by the coroner. The prosecution would like it entered into the Court Record.Judge: Your request is granted, Counsel.The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.Juror No. 4: I was there in person, you know. I saw the whole ludicrous performance. And the only other person on the stage with Mr Asman was that disgraceful excuse for a scientist!Juror No. 2: Then really, by all accounts it must have been him.Juror No. 1: Hmph. Hard to think otherwise, really.Judge: Very well. Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination, please.Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, My Lord! (I need to focus here... It's been a while!)Cross-Examination - A Front for Murder -Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Are you suggesting that's because he fell from a considerable height? Gregson: Exactly. Which highlights somethin' else about this whole rum business. Ryunosuke: What's that? Van Zieks: The fact that the instantaneous kinesis itself was a success. Ryunosuke: Ah! Gregson: After the explosion, the cage with the fella inside suddenly appeared out of nowhere in mid-air. Judge: So although the experiment ended in disaster, the so-called instantaneous kinesis did actually occur. Van Zieks: ...Remind us, Professor, what was the cause of the fatal disaster?Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So the angle of projection is critical, is it? And you calculated it yourself? Personally? Harebrayne: Absolutely! The calculation is far too complicated for anyone but me to carry out! Gregson: Only, you got it wrong, didn't you? Harebrayne: Yes! That's right! That's the point! The calculation is so complicated, even I can make a mistake! Ryunosuke: (Do people fall for that brazen confidence? ...I should try it.) Harebrayne: I, I took into account the subject's height and weight, the wind direction, the ambient temperature... I considered every possible variable! So I just don't understand how this could have happened! Ryunosuke: Obviously then, you had to include the weight of the clothes Mr Asman was wearing at the time, I suppose? Harebrayne: Ah. Crackling comets! The answer should have been three! Ryunosuke: (So much for safety first. The three must be for safety third...)Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Another fatal injury, you say? That doesn't make any sense! Gregson: I didn't think I'd have to spell this out, but here we go... Just because there were two fatal wounds doesn't mean I'm sayin' the victim had two lives to lose, does it? Ryunosuke: ...Too right. Gregson: Obviously at first, we thought the bloke had died due to his spine snappin' in half as well. Ryunosuke: But you're saying that's not the case?! Gregson: You'll get your answer once I've finished my fish an' chips...if you don't keep buttin' in every few seconds! Ryunosuke: (But we all know that's a bottomless bag...) Van Zieks: The victim plummeted thirty feet into a glass tower. It would be reasonable to assume that as the cause of death. Gregson: Right. That's what we all thought. But it was a red herring, wasn't it?Gregson: There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence knew nothing of this crucial information! Van Zieks: The prosecution received this report from the Forensic Investigation Team only this morning. That was the first we knew of it as well. I can only apologise for the impossibility of informing the defence. Ryunosuke: (Sarcastic AND insincere? Thanks...) So, what was the nature of this sharp object? Van Zieks: Among the accused's tools that were in use at the demonstration, one is of particular interest. This. Judge: Ah yes, that would appear to be some kind of screwdriver, wouldn't it, Couns- Harebrayne: AHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAH! There he is! My trusty little companion, Andrew! Ryunosuke: Andrew. Of course. Harebrayne: Ah, do you know each other already? He's one of my dear friends...like all my tools! I've named them all, you know. We're one big, happy family! Judge: ......... Harebrayne: Andrew is my flat-head screwdriver, of course. His brother, Michael, is a cross-head. Judge: Well, it would appear that your beloved 'Andrew' has a red stain on his shank. Ryunosuke: Ah! That, that isn't...? Van Zieks: It's blood, beyond all reasonable doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Gregson: And that's not all. The long, sharp shape of this Andrew fellow is completely consistent with the victim's wound. Harebrayne: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! The court will enter this 'friend' of the defendant as evidence! The screwdriver has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (So one of Professor Harebrayne's tools is the murder weapon...? Great...)Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence knew nothing of this crucial information! Van Zieks: The prosecution received this report from the Forensic Investigation Team only this morning. That was the first we knew of it as well. I can only apologise for the impossibility of informing the defence. Ryunosuke: (Sarcastic AND insincere? Thanks...) So, what was the nature of this sharp object? Van Zieks: Among the accused's tools that were in use at the demonstration, one is of particular interest. This. Judge: Ah yes, that would appear to be some kind of screwdriver, wouldn't it, Couns- Harebrayne: AHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAH! There he is! My trusty little companion, Andrew! Ryunosuke: Andrew. Of course.

That, that isn't...? Van Zieks: It's blood, beyond all reasonable doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Gregson: And that's not all. The long, sharp shape of this Andrew fellow is completely consistent with the victim's wound.Examine evidence Screwdriver Bloodied tip Ryunosuke: This...is blood. Mr Asman's, no doubt. This is the problem with looking at murder weapons... Handle Ryunosuke: I've seen this unusually shaped handle before. It's the same screwdriver that was lodged in the grille on the floor of the kinesis machine. (Which could be important information, so I should definitely make a note of it.) The details of the screwdriver have been updated in the Court Record. Handle (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: There's no question considering the unusual shape of the handle... This is the screwdriver that was poking through the floor of the kinesis machine. It looks a little bit like a capital 'A'. (For 'Andrew' I suppose...)Gregson: So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What grounds do you have for saying that? Gregson: Hah! D'you really need to ask? There were only two people on that public experimentation stage, in front of the whole crowd. Van Zieks: The victim, Mr Odie Asman, and the accused, Professor Harebrayne. And we know for certain that before the experiment, the victim was alive. Juror No. 4: That's right. I saw him with my own eyes! Van Zieks: Furthermore... ...following the explosion and 'kinesis', nobody went anywhere near the body. Gregson: In other words, only someone else on stage with the victim could possibly have done it. And Albert Harebrayne is the only bloke who fits the bill. Unless you've got some other bright idea, sunshine? In which case, let's hear it! Pursue Albert Harebrayne (after pressing fourth statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne! Do you have some information that may be relevant here? Harebrayne: ......... Ryunosuke: Professor! Harebrayne: Ah! Sorry! SORRY! I was just calculating the optimum coefficient of electrolysis to separate molecules in the human body... Ryunosuke: (And the witness stand is the best place for that?) It seemed as though you might have something to say? About Inspector Gregson's last remark. Harebrayne: Ah! AHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Yes! Yes, that's right! Of course! He just said that nobody else could have done it, didn't he? Gregson: Yeah, that's right. Who else could have stabbed the victim, eh? Harebrayne: I DON'T KNOW! ...But! There's no way that I could possibly have stabbed Mr Asman as you say. Gregson: Eh? Ryunosuke: Explain, please, Professor! Harebrayne: Of course. This cold-hearted policeman may not be aware, I suppose... ...but humans are warm-blooded mammals, with blood running continuously through their veins. Gregson: I had heard... Harebrayne: Then surely you see! If I'd plunged something the size of Andrew into the man's chest... ...the whole stage would have been a bloodbath! No, a blood swimming pool! Ryunosuke: Aah... Harebrayne: But thousands of Londoners were watching me at the time. And yet not one of them claims to have seen a swimming pool of blood! Gregson: ......... Well, no...I suppose not... Harebrayne: You see?! Not one! Juror No. 4: Hm... True, I didn't see anything like that... Ryunosuke: (Well done, Professor! That was a great counter-argument!) Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy if I savour a drop from my hallowed chalice to accompany my old friend's adducing. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Here's to you, Albert! Harebrayne: Oh, you're too kind, Barok! But I'm really not a patch on you... Van Zieks: No, you're not. Harebrayne: No? Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: You've neglected to mention one crucial possibility. Harebrayne: I have? Van Zieks: A particular situation in which very little bleeding would result from a stab wound. Gregson: Ah! Of course! Van Zieks: Inspector, enlighten the court, please. Gregson: Yes, sir! Ryunosuke: (Where are they going with this?) Judge: Very well. You will amend your formal testimony now, Inspector Gregson. Changes statement from \"So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!\" to \"The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air!\" Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: My learned friend's silence is your answer, Inspector. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Can't a man have a moment to think?)Gregson: The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Why would you think that, Inspector? Gregson: With any wound, it's only when you pull the weapon out that profuse bleedin' occurs. Whilst it's still lodged in the body, it acts as a stopper of sorts, for want of a better word. Ryunosuke: I, I see... Van Zieks: You don't need a medical degree to be aware of this fact. It's common knowledge for any investigator. Ryunosuke: (Ugh, where's Susato-san when you need her?) Gregson: If you ask me, this bloke masked what he was doin' from view with his body before stabbin' Asman in the chest. Then he beamed the victim off the stage with his fancy device, the screwdriver still where he planted it. Harebrayne: I, I would never do such a thing! Not to my precious tools! I would never use them for such dirty work! You only use tools for their intended purpose! That's common knowledge for any scientist! Van Zieks: ...The fact remains, the lack of blood at the scene can easily be explained. As the prosecution has demonstrated.Present Screwdriver (after examining handle) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding...\"Ryunosuke: (So that's all the testimony I have to work with... I had no idea the victim had been stabbed. That changes everything... Did van Zieks keep that to himself until now on purpose, to gain the advantage? Oh well...I suppose all I can do is press these witnesses for as much new information as possible.)Ryunosuke: You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding... Is that unequivocal?Gregson: Look, there was no blood on the experimentation stage, even though that's where the fellow was stabbed. The only explanation for that is if the screwdriver was still in his body, stoppin' any heavy bleedin'.Van Zieks: It's common medical knowledge, my learned friend. Even on your side of the world.Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, but about this screwdriver... The thing is, we actually saw it at the scene ourselves. On the experimentation stage.Van Zieks: What?Ryunosuke: It was on the floor by the wreckage of the machine, poking through a metal grille. I went to pick it up, but the detective here stopped me. Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson?Gregson: Ah, well, um... Now you come to mention it, yes...Van Zieks: Inspector, are we to understand that you permitted the defence counsel to investigate? That you contravened the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act?Gregson: Eh? No! Not at all! I, I wouldn't do that! I just let him look, nothin' more! I was very clear he wasn't to touch a thing!Ryunosuke: Yes, that's true. This screwdriver was in plain sight on the stage. But it shouldn't have been, should it?Gregson: Wh-What are you gettin' at?Ryunosuke: If this tool had still been in the victim's body when the victim was beamed away by the machine... ...then it shouldn't have still been on the stage.Gregson: Ah!Ryunosuke: That's right! It should have been beamed across to the Crystal Tower along with Mr Asman... ...and been found still lodged in the victim's chest!Gregson: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...How do you explain this, Inspector?Gregson: I...well...um... I don't...Ryunosuke: It looks as though everything that the victim had on his person moved with him when he was 'beamed'. If the screwdriver was still in his chest when the instantaneous kinesis occurred... ...obviously that should have been beamed to the destination as well!Gregson: You...Ryunosuke: (This is a strange situation... Even though people are saying that this instantaneous kinesis is a scientific impossibility... ...we're still basing arguments on the assumption that it did actually take place. Alright. Time to tighten the screws here...) My Lord! If the prosecution is unable to explain this inconsistency in its argument... ...we can only conclude that the testimony given in support cannot be relied upon!Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: (Lord van Zieks is stumped!)???:Judge: ...Do you have something to say, witness?Harebrayne: Yes...I knew it... It bears out... The equations hold... Mr Naruhodo! ...DON'T WORRY!Ryunosuke: ...About what?!Harebrayne: Without delving into the details, there is no inconsistency!Ryunosuke: What?Harebrayne: Even if Andrew had been lodged in Mr Asman's chest... ...my trusty tool wouldn't have moved. Andrew remaining on the stage is consistent with my calculations!Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Van Zieks: It would seem your illusions have been...shattered. Clearly we should hear the accused's explanation. ...Or should I say, this brilliant scientist's explanation?Judge: Hmmm...Ryunosuke: (Just when I'd found an inconsistency in the prosecution's argument... Scientists...)Judge: Very well! The defendant will testify again. Provide us with the scientific explanation as to why the inconsistency asserted by the defence fails to hold!Harebrayne: In the name of Apollo, I will, My Lord!Witness Testimony - The inconsistency Explained -Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together!Ryunosuke: .........Van Zieks: .........Judge: ......... So, the thrust of your testimony, Professor, is...?Van Zieks: ...That based upon his hypothesis, metal objects cannot be moved by this method of instantaneous kinesis.Judge: In other words...?Van Zieks: In other words, since the screwdriver is made of metal, even if it remained lodged in the victim's chest... ...its subsequent discovery on the stage despite the victim being found elsewhere is not an inconsistency.Judge: And therefore...?Van Zieks: And therefore Professor Albert Harebrayne could still have been the killer.Harebrayne: My great hypothesis holds, you see! We, we had to make the cage used to contain the subject from wood for that very reason.Judge: I was not addressing you, witness!Ryunosuke: Um...Professor Harebrayne...Harebrayne: Yes?Ryunosuke: Whose side are you on here?Harebrayne: I don't take sides, Mr Naruhodo! No no no! My only interest lies in upholding my hypothesis! I'm a scientist, after all!Ryunosuke: ......... (Is he working for us or against us? It's very hard to tell...)Van Zieks: Let's see how you cross-examine this testimony, my Nipponese friend.Harebrayne: Yes, fire away, Mr Naruhodo!Cross-Examination - The Inconsistency Explained -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light. Rendered dialogue We're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment! Ladies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you! 22nd October, 9:36 a.m. Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ...Runo! Runo, are you listening? Ryunosuke: Oh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris? Iris: Hmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast? Ryunosuke: No no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again? Iris: Today's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again! Ryunosuke: Ah yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. ......... Iris: You're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Iris: Oh gosh! You're even more down! Sholmes: ......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together. Sholmes: What?! Why didn't you mention it before? Ryunosuke: I, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast? Sholmes: Hm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence. Ryunosuke: (...Thanks.) Sholmes: Of course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations. Ryunosuke: What?! Sholmes: Let's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that- Ryunosuke: Um, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact. Sholmes: Oh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks again.) ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now. Iris: Six months? Ryunosuke: Since I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned. Iris: Oh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Ryunosuke: (Ah...back to moping...) Ryunosuke: What's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me. Iris: I know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together? Sholmes: I want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being. Ryunosuke: Why not? Sholmes: Why not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all! Ryunosuke: (So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?) Iris: I don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: (I suppose I should try to find out what's going on.) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Well, I must be leaving now. Ryunosuke: Yes, understood. See you later, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Hah! You really are a shameless liar sometimes, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: You seek to put me off my guard and follow me, don't you? Well, you would be wasting your time. Ryunosuke: The thought hadn't crossed my mind! (But now I'm wondering where you're going...) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha hah! Well then, 'see you later' indeed! Ryunosuke: (Listen to him. He's still laughing on his way out of the door...) Iris: Alright then, Runo! Let's get going! Ryunosuke: Oh! Um, Iris... What are you wearing? Iris: I've got changed to go to the Great Exhibition. You're going to take me! Ryunosuke: What? But, but I was just about to go to the Supreme Court... Iris: Oh! Well that sounds fun, too! You're going to take me there, then! Ryunosuke: Alright, fine. Just...lower that weapon, would you? Iris: Of course! And after the Supreme Court, then we'll go to see the Great Exhibition! 22nd October Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: It's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. (It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...) Iris: Oh, I love this place! I always find so many interesting books here! Ryunosuke: Of course. I was forgetting that you've been here before. (The time we came here six months ago... ...when Susato-san was given the news that she was to return to Japan.) ???: Ah. I understand you wish to speak with me. Ryunosuke: Oh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well? Stronghart: Let's see... Since you've arrived and requested an audience, it's been four hours, thirty-two minutes and... ...twenty-six seconds. I've kept you waiting a while. My apologies. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all! I like nothing more than standing around, staring into space. Stronghart: ...Good to know. Ryunosuke: (...Good to know that doesn't appear to bother him at all.) Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of London. He's the man who allowed me to start practising as a defence lawyer when I arrived in Britain as a student. You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status. Stronghart: As you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: Oh...I've not heard about that. Stronghart: Investigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it. Ryunosuke: (...Well, it's nice to know where I stand.) Stronghart: So...you wish to consult with me? Of course, I can very well imagine what this is about. Ryunosuke: Ah...well, um... Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, My Lord! (I want to be allowed to start working as a defence lawyer again in court. That's what brought me here today. But actually, there's something else playing on my mind, as it happens...) Iris: Runo, just take a deep breath and come out with it! After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: Well, I must be leaving for my next engagement. I'm already...eleven hours and sixteen minutes late. ...My colleagues may be starting to fidget. Ryunosuke: E-Eleven hours late? That's...quite something. Stronghart: That meeting had already started when I arrived back here for this engagement with you. So lateness was inevitable. Time stops for no man. Ryunosuke: (I'm sure it stopped for me during those twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three reasons...) Oh, yes! Where would I find Lord van Zieks now? Stronghart: I would assume he's at his office. Ryunosuke: (Right, I'll go and ask him about the attack in person. I want to get this straight from the horse's mouth...) Stronghart: Away with you now. I'm leaving Professor Harebrayne's defence entirely in your hands. Ryunosuke: Of, of course, yes! Thank you very much, My Lord! 22nd October Prosecutor's Office Iris: Ooh! So this is the legendary Reaper's office? Ryunosuke: Yes, it appears so. Iris: Brrr, it sends a chill down your spine, doesn't it? What an amazingly deathly atmosphere! Ryunosuke: ...Oh, is that...? (That hooded figure was so still, I hadn't noticed his or her presence. I wonder who it is...?) ???: What are you doing here? Ryunosuke: Agh! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (He's as unwelcoming as I thought he'd be. Actually, maybe even more so...) Oh, I, um... I'm glad to see you're well. Van Zieks: ...I am. Ryunosuke: ......... So...who's the person over by the wall being...punished for something or other? Van Zieks: No punishment is taking place here. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: That's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will. Ryunosuke: I didn't know you had an apprentice. (It must be the same person who was pictured in the newspaper...) Van Zieks: He's very able in combat. ...A requisite skill for anyone under my tutelage. Ryunosuke: Are you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers? Van Zieks: The Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms... After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: Ah yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you... Ryunosuke: Oh! What's that? Van Zieks: That Nipponese man. Is he faring well? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: The one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters. Ryunosuke: Ah! Mr Natsume, you mean? Iris: ...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo. Ryunosuke: He's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day. Van Zieks: I see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. (I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.) Iris: I never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books! Ryunosuke: A mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? (Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.) 22nd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: The warden said cell eleven. That's this one... Iris: Oh! There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look! Ryunosuke: What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: ...! Who are you? Ryunosuke: I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer. Harebrayne: A LAWYER! Ryunosuke: Agh! (Was it something I said?!) Harebrayne: A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?! Ryunosuke: Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't- Harebrayne: Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah... Ryunosuke: ......... (Now's probably not a good time to mention that your zeal made my concentration leave for a while, too...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: So, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct? Harebrayne: As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life! Ryunosuke: ......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Harebrayne: ......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything. Ryunosuke: Thank you for that, Professor. Harebrayne: And thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court! Iris: Alright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: Well, that's where the incident happened, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, I suppose that's true. (Time to investigate at last!) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Ryunosuke: Ugh... The showgrounds are a little too big for my liking... We've been walking around in dense crowds for two hours now, and I've felt myself swooning three times. Iris: There are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too! Ryunosuke: ...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. (We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.) ???: .........! ???: .........! Ryunosuke: (What's that...? I can hear voices from up on the stage. It sounds like an argument...) ???: Right, I've had it with you this time! I'm warnin' you, I'll arrest you in a minute! ???: Oh yeah? Go on then, 'Spector, give it a shot! You ain't got no evidence, an' you know it! Ryunosuke: (Wait... I know those voices.) ???: You've got a cheeky little mouth on you, young lady! But a night in the cells will teach you some manners! ???: Just try it, I dare ya! If ya want that bag o' chips rammed down yer throat! Iris: Yoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there? Gregson: ......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship? Ryunosuke: (...Does that make her three times a lady?) Iris: I'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue. Gregson: Unbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you! Ryunosuke: Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. (But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!) Gregson: Watch it, sunshine! Ryunosuke: S-Sorry... Gregson: What gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case? Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm acting for the defence. Iris: So we're here to investigate! Gregson: Hmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it? Ryunosuke: (Is it really that troubling?) ???: Tsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo! Ryunosuke: Wha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is! ???: Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob. Ryunosuke: This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court. Gina: Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya? Ryunosuke: I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground. Gina: That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's Inspector Lestrade now! Ryunosuke: In... Inspector?! (That badge is homemade, surely...) Gregson: The 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us. Iris: What's that supposed to mean? Gregson: Right, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright? Gina: Right...sir. Ryunosuke: (This... This raises a LOT of questions!) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Iris: Runo, Runo, listen! Ryunosuke: What? What is it? Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like? Ryunosuke: No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow! Iris: But that's where Hurley is. Ryunosuke: What? At, at this popular London attraction? Iris: Yes! Ryunosuke: How is it that you know where he is? Iris: Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Ryunosuke: So that's it, is it? The machine that blew up. Iris: Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share. Ryunosuke: You've seen things like this before, you mean? Iris: Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!' Ryunosuke: Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs. Iris: One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof. Iris: Well anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate! Ryunosuke: Ah look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully. Iris: Really? He just looks confused to me. Ryunosuke: It ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it? Iris: Magnificently...and mercilessly. Ryunosuke: So someone stands in the middle of the machine to be disassembled and then 'beamed' through the air... Iris: Yes, 'beamed' not 'blasted'. That's the point. Ryunosuke: (Yes, that part's crucial, really.) Is something like that even possible, though, Iris? Iris: Oh, Runo. I'm just a child. How should I know? Ryunosuke: (A child when it suits you, you mean...) Iris: From what I can tell, I think if you were to pull this lever here- Gregson: STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! Don't touch that! Iris: Ah ha ha! That was practically instantaneous kinesis the way you flew over just now, Gregsy! Gregson: Please, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here. Iris: So sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it. Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful! Ryunosuke: (It's just like old times, this is...) We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene! Gregson: Hah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, that special dispensation... (The professor mentioned that, too.) Gregson: More red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes. Iris: But...we're allowed to just look, aren't we? Gregson: Eh? Iris: Surely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy? Gregson: ......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! Anythin' you say, Your Ladyship! But please don't get your dainty hands dirty, will you? Iris: Don't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo? Ryunosuke: (She really knows how to get what she wants...) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Gregson: Right, are you done here, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gregson: Isn't it about time you were leavin'? Or rather...it IS about time you were leavin'! That lot are here now. Iris: That lot? Gregson: The Forensic Investigation Team. They'll be givin' me the heave-ho in a minute, too. Iris: Oh dear. Poor Gregsy. Here! Have another cup of my special blend to cheer you up! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! That hit the spot! Yup, hits it every time! Ryunosuke: (Well, at least I've seen the scene with my own eyes. It looks like this is as far as we're going to get with our investigations here at least...) Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this?

(I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) Prosecutor's Office Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Ryunosuke: Wh-What is this place? L-Look at all these t-terrifying scenes! But why are all the p-people so still? (Guillotines... Ruthless murderers... I know what I'll be dreaming about tonight.) Iris: They're all wax models. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked? Ryunosuke: W-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere! Iris: ...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif- Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Iris: What now? Ryunosuke: I've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display. Iris: None of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas. Ryunosuke: They can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them! Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: There's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait. Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: Oh...no... (I must be seeing things...) Ryunosuke: It's...it's... ...the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! (Mr Sholmes has his own wax statue in here? Really?) Iris: Well he is world-famous, after all! Ryunosuke: It's an uncanny resemblance, isn't it? It makes my skin crawl to look at it... Iris: I know! But look, Runo. You can kick this Hurley, and he doesn't move a muscle! Ryunosuke: You can't go around kicking the exhibits, Iris! .........Wait. It, it just moved, I'm sure. And not just a little bit, either! Iris: Hm? Really? Did it? Ryunosuke: And look closely... ...there are beads of sweat on the face...of this waxwork... model... ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Sh-Shall we move on, Iris? ...Over there, look! There's a great murder scene to enjoy! Much more appealing. Sholmes: Sholmes: My dear fellow! I take exception to your recoiling in such a manner, as if you've seen something truly abhorrent! Ryunosuke: Mr...Mr Sholmes! (I knew it!) Sholmes: Iris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Temporary waxwork? What do you mean? Sholmes: And that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me! Iris: But Runo has something he needs to ask you. Sholmes: Ah...a question? Iris: And I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are! Sholmes: Hm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax! Ryunosuke: ...Thank goodness we arrived in time. Sholmes: Indeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss! Iris: Oh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you? Ryunosuke: (He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.) Sholmes: Now that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing! Ryunosuke: Oh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry. Sholmes: And if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken. Ryunosuke: Really? Sholmes: Moreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now. Ryunosuke: (But...how could it be?) Sholmes: We shall speak again presently, my dear fellow. But for now, I must return to my work. Ryunosuke: (What, back to being a temporary waxwork exhibit?) Sholmes: ......... Well? What is it you'd like to ask me, then? Ryunosuke: Um. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks. Sholmes: Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust? And so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together. Ryunosuke: So I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person. Iris: I was sure that you'd know, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: You said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Sholmes...? (He's suddenly clammed up.) Sholmes: Well, it seems we've reached the unavoida- ???: Greetings... Ryunosuke: Oh! Ah...hello. (Where did she appear from? And what's she wearing? Could she look any more mysterious?) ???: I hope...you are appreciating my museum? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- (Not again!) Tusspells: My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork. Ryunosuke: Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Bien s\u00fbr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add. Ryunosuke: ...Is that significant somehow? Tusspells: I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi. Ryunosuke: Right... Tusspells: Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular. Ryunosuke: (That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.) Tusspells: I was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble. Iris: She sounds deadly serious. Ryunosuke: (That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?) Iris: Let's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean. Ryunosuke: Yes, I know, but... Iris: I'm so curious! I want to know what's happening here! Ryunosuke: (Haven't we got enough on our plate already?!) Ryunosuke: Um, I wonder...could I ask you something? Tusspells: Bien s\u00fbr... Ryunosuke: I'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. [sic] Some kind of incident, perhaps? Tusspells: ......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you? Ryunosuke: Oh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! (He's disappeared!) ???: ...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade. Ryunosuke: Ah! Th-There you are! Tusspells: Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down? Sholmes: My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead! Tusspells: ...! Sholmes: Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police. Tusspells: Why ever not?! Ryunosuke: (She's turned as white as a sheet...) Sholmes: Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance! Tusspells: ......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we? Sholmes: Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain? Tusspells: That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it. Sholmes: Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder? Tusspells: Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there! Sholmes: Nothing amiss, madame? What about the arm protruding ominously from under the curtain? Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens. Tusspells: ......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soup\u00e7on. Sholmes: I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak graveyard scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is nowhere to be seen. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor. Ryunosuke: Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself! Sholmes: I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit. Tusspells: Why...? Why would you say that? Sholmes: And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime! Tusspells: AAAAAAH! Ryunosuke: (She looks as pale as candle wax...) Tusspells: I, I don't understand... Sholmes: So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! 'Waxwork for sale'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold the infamous killer - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds! Tusspells: Nooooooooon! Sholmes: Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively. Tusspells: What are you suggesting?! Sholmes: He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret... Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Topic 2 Waxwork Location Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Such as is worn by policemen as a secret sign to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay. Tusspells: What are you talking about? Sholmes: The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards. Tusspells: But... Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame? Tusspells: I, I do not... Sholmes: Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ......... Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: I see I've stunned you all into silence. Iris: You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot... Ryunosuke: Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly ruthless murderer, wouldn't it? Sholmes: ......... The killer policeman, Ottermole. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether. Iris: And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole! Ryunosuke: So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be? Sholmes: Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well. Ryunosuke: But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model? Sholmes: It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective? Ryunosuke: S-So...it is quite a lot then. Tusspells: ......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down. Ryunosuke: (That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...) Iris: Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions... Iris: Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight! Ryunosuke: Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger! Sholmes: Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Ryunosuke: She definitely looked in this direction, it's true. Iris: But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds. Ryunosuke: Oh? Iris: She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything. Ryunosuke: ......... (For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.) W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance. Iris: Let's follow that furtive glance again and see if there's anything else that could explain it! The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Iris: Judging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all. Ryunosuke: (The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...) But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure. Iris: ...Then let's have more of a look around! Ryunosuke: The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note! Sholmes: Quite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork. Tusspells: Agh! Sholmes: Two hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it. Tusspells: The model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have... Sholmes: In summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is ransom money! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: So if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is? Iris: We could just ask him when he comes around. Ryunosuke: ...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris. Iris: Yes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down. Ryunosuke: Well, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around... What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious. Iris: Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?! Ryunosuke: ...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. (Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...) Ryunosuke: What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand! Sholmes: Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow. Tusspells: How, how could you...? Ryunosuke: The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's a left hand. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model! Tusspells: KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage. Ryunosuke: So you mean, that arm...? Tusspells: Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir. Sholmes: Hm, no small keepsake. Ryunosuke: Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms... Tusspells: I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson. Ryunosuke: You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back. Sholmes: And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our conclusion: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Kidnapped! Solved Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is a sign to other policemen that some crime is underway. Iris: A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard. Ryunosuke: ...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away. Iris: Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course. Ryunosuke: Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible. Iris: But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean... Ryunosuke: ...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet. Ryunosuke: Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub. Sholmes: No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model! Ryunosuke: I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes. Tusspells: He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man. Sholmes: Naturally! What other explanation could there be? Ryunosuke: And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it? Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Ryunosuke: A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known? Iris: It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money. Ryunosuke: (Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...) So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really? Iris: Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Iris: If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not. Ryunosuke: Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think? Iris: Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail. Ryunosuke: (If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...) Ryunosuke: The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch! Sholmes: Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard! Ryunosuke: ...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then... Sholmes: And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep. Ryunosuke: But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence? Sholmes: No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes! The secret sign used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway. Tusspells: Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such criminal activity happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective. Sholmes: So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth. Ryunosuke: The waxwork of the especially ruthless killer from the special exhibit has been kidnapped. Sholmes: And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Still a mystery! Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Tusspells: All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe. Sholmes: It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted? Tusspells: ......... Yes. Tragically, it was... Sholmes: Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please. Tusspells: ...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work. Sholmes: ......... The talents of a great detective could be put to better use, I feel, but as you wish... Tusspells: It was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death. Sholmes: And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction. Ryunosuke: But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks? Sholmes: ......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to the victims he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest. Iris: What do you mean, Hurley? Sholmes: Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration. Ryunosuke: Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with noble blood! Iris: Oh gosh! Sholmes: It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks. Ryunosuke: No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?! Sholmes: I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today. Ryunosuke: ......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past... Sholmes: Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit. Tusspells: I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you. ???: ...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here. Harebrayne: It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok. Van Zieks: It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places. Harebrayne: I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen... Van Zieks: ......... Tomorrow the court will decide. Harebrayne: Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it! Van Zieks: I must warn you... Harebrayne: Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you? Van Zieks: ...Yes. Harebrayne: ......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...? Van Zieks: What? Harebrayne: ......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart. Van Zieks: My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else. Harebrayne: Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok. Van Zieks: Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court.

And it's set on a background of a sunflower design. ...Or was it a dandelion? ...Or a chrysanthemum, perhaps... .........Well anyway, no one should be judged on their knowledge of flowers...or lack of it. Inside of armband Ryunosuke: The name of the armband's owner is very finely embroidered here. 'Kazuma Asogi'... One day, when I'm back in Japan and I've earned my official law qualification there... ...I'll wear one band on each arm. ...That should make me a very well-balanced lawyer, I suppose.Ryunosuke: (I can't believe it's been six months since I was last allowed to work in court. And now here I am, back at the Old Bailey...)Harebrayne: Ah! M-Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Good morning, Professor Harebrayne.Harebrayne: I, I don't understand! It doesn't make any sense! The atmospheric pressure in here is off the charts! I've never felt anything like it! It's, it's crushing me!Ryunosuke: I feel it every time I'm here. That...gravity.Harebrayne: Well, this is Britain's highest court... But are you telling me it's filled with some kind of device that can actually control air pressure?!Ryunosuke: ......... I think it's probably all in the mind.Harebrayne: Ah. Yes, well...you won't let me down, will you, Mr Naruhodo? I'm counting on you in today's trial...to save my life! To save the secret of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine from being made public!Ryunosuke: Yes, I understand. (I know what I have to do. I have to establish that the explosion two days ago was nothing more than an unfortunate accident.)Harebrayne: Well, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, really. Justice will prevail!???: My commiserations, Mr Naruhodo. You appear to have been lumbered with a most tiresome case here.Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! I didn't expect to see you here.Iris: That was very mean, Runo, leaving me alone at home with Hurley. It took me at least an hour to wake him!Harebrayne: Ah... Oh... Ah... Is it...? Are you...? HEEEEEERLOCK SHOOOOOOLMES?!Sholmes: Indeed, sir. I am he. Heeeeeerlock Shoooooolmes.Harebrayne: Oh, I've heard all about your exploits, even whilst living in Germany.Iris: Ah yes. Randst Magazine is on sale in Germany, too.Harebrayne: This month's instalment was sublime! Your deduction in 'The Adventure of Silver Blaze' was wonderful!Sholmes: Ah yes, a memorable case indeed. It concerned a snake, I seem to recall.Iris: No, that was 'The Speckled Band.'Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for coming. I do appreciate your support.Sholmes: I'm sorry to disappoint you, my dear fellow, but I'm afraid I can't stay.Ryunosuke: Oh.Sholmes: I have urgent business at Madame Tusspells.Ryunosuke: You mean...your waxwork job?Sholmes: No no, the waxwork abduction, of course. Madame has engaged my services.Ryunosuke: Ah, so you're trying to get to the bottom of that ransom note, are you?Sholmes: The week's wages depend on it! ...As does the safe return of the waxwork, naturally. As such, I intend to give it my undivided attention.Ryunosuke: Oh, well, never mind then. I understand.Sholmes: Of course, with my skills of observation and reasoning, resolving the matter will be as easy as proverbial pie. I shall return forthwith. For until I solve the case, I shall have no money to afford a pie of any description.Iris: Ooh, then you must absolutely give it your full attention, Hurley!Sholmes: Quite, Iris, quite. But life is riddled with irony, you know. Whenever I give something my full attention, I have a quite insatiable desire for a pie. One of the universe's intractable mysteries, you might say.Harebrayne: Oh yes! Quite! Definitely! Absolutely! I totally understand!Ryunosuke: (...Is someone a little starstruck?)Sholmes: I wish you the very best of luck, Professor Harebrayne.Harebrayne: Oh! Ah! Ooh! Why, thank you!Sholmes: Before I depart, Mr Naruhodo...a word in your ear, if you please?Ryunosuke: ...? What's this about?Sholmes: As you have remarkably little grounding in science, I feel I ought to inform you... As compelling as this 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis' hypothesis may be... ...a practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible.Ryunosuke: But, but the professor said the demonstration was a success!Sholmes: Yes, it would appear that he fervently believes it was.Iris: I've read Professor Bunnybrain's paper about it, too, Runo. And I have to say... ...I'm sure it can't be done. It could barely be done theoretically, let alone practically.Ryunosuke: (So he's completely barking up the wrong tree?) But how could an experiment that had no possibility of succeeding in fact succeed? That's contradictory.Sholmes: And it's that contradiction that will be at the heart of the trial, I've no doubt.Ryunosuke: (What's that supposed to mean?)Sholmes: Now, I must hurry along. I wish you the best of luck, my dear fellow.Iris: See you later, Hurley! Well, it looks like you're on your own today, Runo. But chin up! You can do it!Ryunosuke: Oh! What about you, Iris?Iris: Ah, no, I'm afraid I can't help. I have something I need to do.Ryunosuke: ...I see.Iris: Hehe! It's going to be a big surprise for you when you find out what it is!Ryunosuke: Haah... (That sounds ominous...)Bailiff: Counsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Make your way into the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke: We're on our way! (An experiment that the laws of science say can't possibly succeed... ...and a scientist who's convinced that it did. That's the riddle you have to unlock here, Ryunosuke! That's the key to this case!)23rd October, 9:10 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are sitting today for the public trial of Professor Albert Harebrayne. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready.Ryunosuke: The defence is... The defence is ready, My Lord! ......... (I'm six months out of practice. And what's more... ...I'm without Susato-san today.) ......... (Ugh... Is it just my imagination, or does the air in here feel even more oppressive than usual?)Judge: So... ...I must say I recollect the victim of this case all too well. Mr Odie Asman.Van Zieks: Mr Asman was well known as a financier...though that was merely a front for his diverse criminal activities.Judge: It was only a month ago that the man appeared in court prosecuted by you, Lord van Zieks. But the jury unanimously found him not guilty.Ryunosuke: (Because every member of the jury had been bribed, by the sound of it. These powerful London criminals are prepared to go to extreme lengths to keep their freedom.)Judge: But two days ago, on 21st October, Mr Asman met his end. The work of the Reaper, was it?Van Zieks: ......... If that is how Your Lordship would describe divine retribution... But the fact remains that Mr Asman's death... ...was a direct result of the actions of the accused, Professor Harebrayne.Judge: Very well, then. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... You have been selected at random to represent the will of the people. Are the six of you ready to fulfil your societal duty?Juror No. 1: I'm most gratified to have been selected to carry out this important civic duty, My Lord.Juror No. 2: To have a man's fate in the palm of one's hand... Oh gosh! Oh golly! It sends shivers down my spine.Juror No. 3: Science experiments, magic, conjuring tricks, courtroom trials... All are nothing more than performances.Juror No. 4: Any spurious scholar that defiles the reputation of science deserves to hang!Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?Juror No. 6: ......... Wasn't like this in my day! Wasn't like this at all!Ryunosuke: ......... (That's...that's... ...the police killer Ottermole look-alike...again. And he's as exhausted as ever, it seems.)Judge: Now, as I'm sure you are all aware... ...the incident we are here to judge today tragically took place at the Great Exhibition, shortly after its opening.Van Zieks: Though the death toll could have been far worse. With the exception of the victim, no one was killed. Nevertheless, the dream of the science being exhibited rapidly turned into a nightmare for the spectators.Judge: A tragic turn of events. And as such, the eyes of all London- No, of the whole world will be on this trial. It is our duty to reach a swift and just conclusion, I feel. So...your opening statement please, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks: At the heart of this incident... ...is technology never before demonstrated anywhere in the world.Judge: One of science's latest developments, I take it? The government is keen to capitalise on the Great Exhibition to improve Britain's technological advantage.Van Zieks: The technology being demonstrated by the accused was described as 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis'.Judge: Good Lord!Ryunosuke: It's designed to 'disassemble' human subjects using extremely high-voltage electricity... ...and 'beam' them instantly to another location where they are subsequently reassembled.Judge: Is...is such a thing even within the realms of possibility?Juror No. 1: Well I don't believe it, that's for sure.Juror No. 2: Disassembling people with electricity? My goodness! How shocking!Juror No. 4: Hah! The whole idea is absurd! The hypothesis would never stand up to scrutiny!Judge: Sir, I believe you are a fellow of the Royal Society, are you not? An expert in your field?Juror No. 4: I am, and my word on the matter can be considered final. Instantaneous kinesis is poppycock!Ryunosuke: (So this expert and Mr Sholmes are in agreement. It's impossible...)Judge: What is the prosecution's view on the matter?Van Zieks: ......... The prosecution would assert... ...that the accused's instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a success.Ryunosuke: What?!Juror No. 4: What rot!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar!Van Zieks: The professor's hypothesis is currently under investigation by the British government. If it is deemed to have merit, a substantial research grant would be made available. The accused made use of the invention built on his new hypothesis to take Mr Asman's life... ...in order to be the sole benefactor of the grant.Ryunosuke: But, but...Van Zieks: This disastrous demonstration was no accident. It was carefully designed from the outset to end the life of the victim.Judge: Thank you, Lord van Zieks. The prosecution's stance is clear. But you will now bring forth witnesses to substantiate your claims.Van Zieks: ...Gladly, My Lord. Bailiff! Show the first witnesses to the stand!Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court.Gregson: Yes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division. I was on duty at the demonstration on the day in question and in charge of the followin' investigation.Harebrayne: ......... Albert Harebrayne! S-S-Scientist!Van Zieks: You were born in England, but have been carrying out research in Germany in recent years. Correct?Harebrayne: Yes. Yes, that's right. After graduating from university here in Britain, I went to work in Germany...and made an amazing discovery! Which is what brought me back! I had to demonstrate my incredible hypothesis at the Great Exhibition!Gregson: What you demonstrated was incredible alright. An incredible explosion!Harebrayne: But the science! The science was a success! The instantaneous kinesis worked! E-Everyone saw it! They must have done! Yes, there was the terrible accident, but... ...the demonstration of my hypothesis was a success!Gregson: Well, that much is undeniable. As shown in this photograph taken by the Forensic Investigation Team.Judge: This was taken inside the Crystal Tower, I take it? The centrepiece of the exhibition, no less.Gregson: That's right, My Lord. Seems the victim rammed straight into it.Judge: Hm, I see... Very well, submit the photograph as evidence.The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record.Gregson: As the court's heard, the victim of the incident was Mr Odie Asman. There have been a number of allegations made against the man, but puttin' them aside for the time bein'... ...he was the man who financed the research for the experiment and the demonstration itself.Judge: I see. So to summarise the situation... ...the defendant is accused of taking the life of the man who funded his work. Would that be correct?Gregson: Exactly.Ryunosuke: But couldn't it be... ...that the explosion was caused by some malfunction in the apparatus used for the demonstration?Harebrayne: That's right! That must be it! My splendid machine... My poor, splendid machine...Gregson: You saw it yesterday, didn't you? We can't even examine the wreckage thanks to the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act.Harebrayne: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! The wreckage?! THE WRECKAGE?!Judge: But that being the case, how can the facts be established? How can it possibly be determined whether this was an accident or a deliberate and malicious act?Van Zieks: Extremely simply, My Lord.Judge: I beg your pardon?Van Zieks: Isn't that right, witness?Harebrayne: Wha...? Sorry? ME?!Van Zieks: No. Your neighbour.Gregson: Yes, sir! It was murder, plain and simple. Anyone could state that with complete certainty.Ryunosuke: What?! (How can he possibly think that?)Judge: Thank you, Inspector. I think we had better proceed to formal testimony. You will explain to the court on what grounds you claim this experiment to have been a front for murder!Witness Testimony - A Front for Murder -Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck.Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake!Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!Judge: ......... An extraordinary business... In addition to suffering a broken neck, the victim was stabbed in the heart?Ryunosuke: (Information I would really like to have heard from someone other than the judge...)Gregson: The coroner says death would have been all but instant from a wound like that.Van Zieks: You could say, in fact... ...that the victim was killed twice by the accused.Harebrayne: No, no and no! That couldn't be further from the truth!Gregson: I have here the experiment plan document that was submitted to the security team. The victim stood himself inside somethin' called 'the birdcage', ready to be 'beamed' instantly... ...to the second level of the Crystal Tower, about twenty-five yards away.Van Zieks: The experiment did not go according to plan, however. As the machine was put into operation, there was a large explosion. The blast caused the beam transmitter to point higher than intended. Accordingly, the kinesis resulted in the birdcage materialising in mid-air... ...from where it subsequently fell, crashing through the glass of the Crystal Tower's large round window.Judge: My word... One assumes the victim's neck was broken upon impact with the tower, then?Harebrayne: I'm, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen! The machine was just too powerful! But honestly! Really! I swear! It was just an accident! A terrible accident!Van Zieks: Unfortunately, that excuse can't save you.Gregson: No, not considerin' the sharp murder weapon that pierced the victim's heart.Harebrayne: M-Murder weapon?! What are you saying?!Van Zieks: This is the autopsy report submitted by the coroner. The prosecution would like it entered into the Court Record.Judge: Your request is granted, Counsel.The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.Juror No. 4: I was there in person, you know. I saw the whole ludicrous performance. And the only other person on the stage with Mr Asman was that disgraceful excuse for a scientist!Juror No. 2: Then really, by all accounts it must have been him.Juror No. 1: Hmph. Hard to think otherwise, really.Judge: Very well. Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination, please.Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, My Lord! (I need to focus here... It's been a while!)Cross-Examination - A Front for Murder -Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Are you suggesting that's because he fell from a considerable height? Gregson: Exactly. Which highlights somethin' else about this whole rum business. Ryunosuke: What's that? Van Zieks: The fact that the instantaneous kinesis itself was a success. Ryunosuke: Ah! Gregson: After the explosion, the cage with the fella inside suddenly appeared out of nowhere in mid-air. Judge: So although the experiment ended in disaster, the so-called instantaneous kinesis did actually occur. Van Zieks: ...Remind us, Professor, what was the cause of the fatal disaster?Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So the angle of projection is critical, is it? And you calculated it yourself? Personally? Harebrayne: Absolutely! The calculation is far too complicated for anyone but me to carry out! Gregson: Only, you got it wrong, didn't you? Harebrayne: Yes! That's right! That's the point! The calculation is so complicated, even I can make a mistake! Ryunosuke: (Do people fall for that brazen confidence? ...I should try it.) Harebrayne: I, I took into account the subject's height and weight, the wind direction, the ambient temperature... I considered every possible variable! So I just don't understand how this could have happened! Ryunosuke: Obviously then, you had to include the weight of the clothes Mr Asman was wearing at the time, I suppose? Harebrayne: Ah. Crackling comets! The answer should have been three! Ryunosuke: (So much for safety first. The three must be for safety third...)Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Another fatal injury, you say? That doesn't make any sense! Gregson: I didn't think I'd have to spell this out, but here we go... Just because there were two fatal wounds doesn't mean I'm sayin' the victim had two lives to lose, does it? Ryunosuke: ...Too right. Gregson: Obviously at first, we thought the bloke had died due to his spine snappin' in half as well. Ryunosuke: But you're saying that's not the case?! Gregson: You'll get your answer once I've finished my fish an' chips...if you don't keep buttin' in every few seconds! Ryunosuke: (But we all know that's a bottomless bag...) Van Zieks: The victim plummeted thirty feet into a glass tower. It would be reasonable to assume that as the cause of death. Gregson: Right. That's what we all thought. But it was a red herring, wasn't it?Gregson: There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence knew nothing of this crucial information! Van Zieks: The prosecution received this report from the Forensic Investigation Team only this morning. That was the first we knew of it as well. I can only apologise for the impossibility of informing the defence. Ryunosuke: (Sarcastic AND insincere? Thanks...) So, what was the nature of this sharp object? Van Zieks: Among the accused's tools that were in use at the demonstration, one is of particular interest. This. Judge: Ah yes, that would appear to be some kind of screwdriver, wouldn't it, Couns- Harebrayne: AHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAH! There he is! My trusty little companion, Andrew! Ryunosuke: Andrew. Of course. Harebrayne: Ah, do you know each other already? He's one of my dear friends...like all my tools! I've named them all, you know. We're one big, happy family! Judge: ......... Harebrayne: Andrew is my flat-head screwdriver, of course. His brother, Michael, is a cross-head. Judge: Well, it would appear that your beloved 'Andrew' has a red stain on his shank. Ryunosuke: Ah! That, that isn't...? Van Zieks: It's blood, beyond all reasonable doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Gregson: And that's not all. The long, sharp shape of this Andrew fellow is completely consistent with the victim's wound. Harebrayne: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! The court will enter this 'friend' of the defendant as evidence! The screwdriver has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (So one of Professor Harebrayne's tools is the murder weapon...? Great...)Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence knew nothing of this crucial information! Van Zieks: The prosecution received this report from the Forensic Investigation Team only this morning. That was the first we knew of it as well. I can only apologise for the impossibility of informing the defence. Ryunosuke: (Sarcastic AND insincere? Thanks...) So, what was the nature of this sharp object? Van Zieks: Among the accused's tools that were in use at the demonstration, one is of particular interest. This. Judge: Ah yes, that would appear to be some kind of screwdriver, wouldn't it, Couns- Harebrayne: AHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAH! There he is! My trusty little companion, Andrew! Ryunosuke: Andrew. Of course. Harebrayne: Ah, do you know each other already? He's one of my dear friends...like all my tools! I've named them all, you know. We're one big, happy family! Judge: ......... Harebrayne: Andrew is my flat-head screwdriver, of course. His brother, Michael, is a cross-head. Judge: Well, it would appear that your beloved 'Andrew' has a red stain on his shank. Ryunosuke: Ah! That, that isn't...? Van Zieks: It's blood, beyond all reasonable doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Gregson: And that's not all. The long, sharp shape of this Andrew fellow is completely consistent with the victim's wound.Examine evidence Screwdriver Bloodied tip Ryunosuke: This...is blood. Mr Asman's, no doubt. This is the problem with looking at murder weapons... Handle Ryunosuke: I've seen this unusually shaped handle before. It's the same screwdriver that was lodged in the grille on the floor of the kinesis machine. (Which could be important information, so I should definitely make a note of it.) The details of the screwdriver have been updated in the Court Record. Handle (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: There's no question considering the unusual shape of the handle... This is the screwdriver that was poking through the floor of the kinesis machine. It looks a little bit like a capital 'A'. (For 'Andrew' I suppose...)Gregson: So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What grounds do you have for saying that? Gregson: Hah! D'you really need to ask? There were only two people on that public experimentation stage, in front of the whole crowd. Van Zieks: The victim, Mr Odie Asman, and the accused, Professor Harebrayne. And we know for certain that before the experiment, the victim was alive. Juror No. 4: That's right. I saw him with my own eyes! Van Zieks: Furthermore... ...following the explosion and 'kinesis', nobody went anywhere near the body. Gregson: In other words, only someone else on stage with the victim could possibly have done it. And Albert Harebrayne is the only bloke who fits the bill. Unless you've got some other bright idea, sunshine? In which case, let's hear it! Pursue Albert Harebrayne (after pressing fourth statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne! Do you have some information that may be relevant here? Harebrayne: ......... Ryunosuke: Professor! Harebrayne: Ah! Sorry! SORRY! I was just calculating the optimum coefficient of electrolysis to separate molecules in the human body... Ryunosuke: (And the witness stand is the best place for that?) It seemed as though you might have something to say? About Inspector Gregson's last remark. Harebrayne: Ah! AHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Yes! Yes, that's right! Of course! He just said that nobody else could have done it, didn't he? Gregson: Yeah, that's right. Who else could have stabbed the victim, eh? Harebrayne: I DON'T KNOW! ...But! There's no way that I could possibly have stabbed Mr Asman as you say. Gregson: Eh? Ryunosuke: Explain, please, Professor! Harebrayne: Of course. This cold-hearted policeman may not be aware, I suppose... ...but humans are warm-blooded mammals, with blood running continuously through their veins. Gregson: I had heard... Harebrayne: Then surely you see! If I'd plunged something the size of Andrew into the man's chest... ...the whole stage would have been a bloodbath! No, a blood swimming pool! Ryunosuke: Aah... Harebrayne: But thousands of Londoners were watching me at the time. And yet not one of them claims to have seen a swimming pool of blood! Gregson: ......... Well, no...I suppose not... Harebrayne: You see?! Not one! Juror No. 4: Hm... True, I didn't see anything like that... Ryunosuke: (Well done, Professor! That was a great counter-argument!) Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy if I savour a drop from my hallowed chalice to accompany my old friend's adducing. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Here's to you, Albert! Harebrayne: Oh, you're too kind, Barok! But I'm really not a patch on you... Van Zieks: No, you're not. Harebrayne: No? Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: You've neglected to mention one crucial possibility. Harebrayne: I have? Van Zieks: A particular situation in which very little bleeding would result from a stab wound. Gregson: Ah! Of course! Van Zieks: Inspector, enlighten the court, please. Gregson: Yes, sir! Ryunosuke: (Where are they going with this?) Judge: Very well. You will amend your formal testimony now, Inspector Gregson. Changes statement from \"So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!\" to \"The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air!\" Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: My learned friend's silence is your answer, Inspector. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Can't a man have a moment to think?)Gregson: The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Why would you think that, Inspector? Gregson: With any wound, it's only when you pull the weapon out that profuse bleedin' occurs. Whilst it's still lodged in the body, it acts as a stopper of sorts, for want of a better word. Ryunosuke: I, I see... Van Zieks: You don't need a medical degree to be aware of this fact. It's common knowledge for any investigator. Ryunosuke: (Ugh, where's Susato-san when you need her?) Gregson: If you ask me, this bloke masked what he was doin' from view with his body before stabbin' Asman in the chest. Then he beamed the victim off the stage with his fancy device, the screwdriver still where he planted it. Harebrayne: I, I would never do such a thing! Not to my precious tools! I would never use them for such dirty work! You only use tools for their intended purpose! That's common knowledge for any scientist! Van Zieks: ...The fact remains, the lack of blood at the scene can easily be explained. As the prosecution has demonstrated.Present Screwdriver (after examining handle) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding...\"Ryunosuke: (So that's all the testimony I have to work with... I had no idea the victim had been stabbed. That changes everything... Did van Zieks keep that to himself until now on purpose, to gain the advantage? Oh well...I suppose all I can do is press these witnesses for as much new information as possible.)Ryunosuke: You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding... Is that unequivocal?Gregson: Look, there was no blood on the experimentation stage, even though that's where the fellow was stabbed. The only explanation for that is if the screwdriver was still in his body, stoppin' any heavy bleedin'.Van Zieks: It's common medical knowledge, my learned friend. Even on your side of the world.Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, but about this screwdriver... The thing is, we actually saw it at the scene ourselves. On the experimentation stage.Van Zieks: What?Ryunosuke: It was on the floor by the wreckage of the machine, poking through a metal grille. I went to pick it up, but the detective here stopped me. Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson?Gregson: Ah, well, um... Now you come to mention it, yes...Van Zieks: Inspector, are we to understand that you permitted the defence counsel to investigate? That you contravened the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act?Gregson: Eh? No! Not at all! I, I wouldn't do that! I just let him look, nothin' more! I was very clear he wasn't to touch a thing!Ryunosuke: Yes, that's true. This screwdriver was in plain sight on the stage. But it shouldn't have been, should it?Gregson: Wh-What are you gettin' at?Ryunosuke: If this tool had still been in the victim's body when the victim was beamed away by the machine... ...then it shouldn't have still been on the stage.Gregson: Ah!Ryunosuke: That's right! It should have been beamed across to the Crystal Tower along with Mr Asman... ...and been found still lodged in the victim's chest!Gregson: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...How do you explain this, Inspector?Gregson: I...well...um... I don't...Ryunosuke: It looks as though everything that the victim had on his person moved with him when he was 'beamed'. If the screwdriver was still in his chest when the instantaneous kinesis occurred... ...obviously that should have been beamed to the destination as well!Gregson: You...Ryunosuke: (This is a strange situation... Even though people are saying that this instantaneous kinesis is a scientific impossibility... ...we're still basing arguments on the assumption that it did actually take place. Alright. Time to tighten the screws here...) My Lord! If the prosecution is unable to explain this inconsistency in its argument... ...we can only conclude that the testimony given in support cannot be relied upon!Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: (Lord van Zieks is stumped!)???:Judge: ...Do you have something to say, witness?Harebrayne: Yes...I knew it... It bears out... The equations hold... Mr Naruhodo! ...DON'T WORRY!Ryunosuke: ...About what?!Harebrayne: Without delving into the details, there is no inconsistency!Ryunosuke: What?Harebrayne: Even if Andrew had been lodged in Mr Asman's chest... ...my trusty tool wouldn't have moved. Andrew remaining on the stage is consistent with my calculations!Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Van Zieks: It would seem your illusions have been...shattered. Clearly we should hear the accused's explanation. ...Or should I say, this brilliant scientist's explanation?Judge: Hmmm...Ryunosuke: (Just when I'd found an inconsistency in the prosecution's argument... Scientists...)Judge: Very well! The defendant will testify again. Provide us with the scientific explanation as to why the inconsistency asserted by the defence fails to hold!Harebrayne: In the name of Apollo, I will, My Lord!Witness Testimony - The inconsistency Explained -Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together!Ryunosuke: .........Van Zieks: .........Judge: ......... So, the thrust of your testimony, Professor, is...?Van Zieks: ...That based upon his hypothesis, metal objects cannot be moved by this method of instantaneous kinesis.Judge: In other words...?Van Zieks: In other words, since the screwdriver is made of metal, even if it remained lodged in the victim's chest... ...its subsequent discovery on the stage despite the victim being found elsewhere is not an inconsistency.Judge: And therefore...?Van Zieks: And therefore Professor Albert Harebrayne could still have been the killer.Harebrayne: My great hypothesis holds, you see! We, we had to make the cage used to contain the subject from wood for that very reason.Judge: I was not addressing you, witness!Ryunosuke: Um...Professor Harebrayne...Harebrayne: Yes?Ryunosuke: Whose side are you on here?Harebrayne: I don't take sides, Mr Naruhodo! No no no! My only interest lies in upholding my hypothesis! I'm a scientist, after all!Ryunosuke: ......... (Is he working for us or against us? It's very hard to tell...)Van Zieks: Let's see how you cross-examine this testimony, my Nipponese friend.Harebrayne: Yes, fire away, Mr Naruhodo!Cross-Examination - The Inconsistency Explained -Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: And yet your retort to my argument wasn't lacking in confidence in any way. Harebrayne: 'No scientist can find the truth without first finding self-belief...' Those were the words of a certain scientist I hold in the very highest esteem! Ryunosuke: But you realise that disproving my argument puts you in a very precarious position, don't you? Harebrayne: 'No scientist should strive to protect himself more than he strives to protect the truth...' More words of the same great scientist, you know! Ryunosuke: ...Words that are causing me a lot of trouble. Who is this scientist? Harebrayne: I'm afraid I couldn't tell you, Mr Naruhodo. But, but as soon as I remember the magnificent genius's name, you'll be the first to know! Ryunosuke: It...might be worth keeping the names of your idols to mind? Van Zieks: You're wasting your breath, my learned friend. This scatterbrain even forgets my name at times. Ryunosuke: (...So Lord van Zieks really did have a friend once. But I didn't notice Hell freezing over...)Harebrayne: My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Your 'hypothesis' states it? So this isn't proven then? Harebrayne: No, no, of course not. It's merely a hypothesis. But a good one! Based upon thousands of calculations! But it is widely known that metals can't be decomposed by electrolysis. ...Yes! Of course! So I AM right! My hypothesis is clearly correct! Ryunosuke: (What is it about incriminating himself that makes this man so happy...?) Harebrayne: It's the whole reason that the birdcage is made of wood, you see. Ryunosuke: Sorry. The birdcage? Harebrayne: Yes, that's what I call the C. obtusa cage in which Mr Asman was placed for the kinesis. Judge: Ah, the jail cell in which the victim was detained. It does indeed seem to be made of a timber of some sort. Ryunosuke: (I'll thank you not to refer to it as an instrument of incarceration, Your Lordship...) Van Zieks: In short... ...any weapon lodged in the victim when he was beamed away by instantaneous kinesis... ...would have been left behind on the stage if it was made of metal. Correct? Harebrayne: Yes! That's it! Yes yes yes! It all fits perfectly with the mathematical model! Judge: But the ultimate conclusion then... ...is that the defendant alone had the opportunity to inflict this fatal injury on the victim, is it not? Harebrayne: AH! Judge: 'Ah!' indeed, sir. Ryunosuke: (Someone beam me out of this nightmare...)Present Photograph of the Victim Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis...\"Harebrayne: In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...You seem to be pleased by that. Harebrayne: Yes! Another example of my hypothesis holding true! But I sense some sarcasm, Mr Naruhodo. Are you not pleased? Ryunosuke: No. Harebrayne: ......... I knew it. At the end of day, I'm the one responsible for Mr Asman losing his life. The advancement of science is no excuse! I know that! Ryunosuke: No, you're quite right. Judge: Tell the court, did you have a close relationship with Mr Asman? Harebrayne: Oh, well no, not really. I mean, I'd only met him two or three times. And we only ever discussed my hypothesis and the project...and the research grant, of course.Present Photograph of the Victim Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis...\"Harebrayne: Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: How did you come to know Mr Asman in the first place? Harebrayne: ...A year ago now, a small provincial science journal published a little paper about my work. Judge: That's a scientific journal? Good gracious, I should need new spectacles! Harebrayne: I might have had an extraordinary hypothesis and great promise, but at the time, I had no money. I, I had to eat tiny little meals at a tiny little caf\u00e9 and drink watered-down water out of a tiny little glass... But...Mr Asman read the paper and came to visit me at my tiny little laboratory! Van Zieks: And offered you money to help fund your work? Harebrayne: Exactly! That's exactly what happened! I handled the theoretical side of things, and Mr Asman provided me with an engineer for the practical. ...And the three of us produced that fantastic machine together! Ryunosuke: The machine that you brought to the Great Exhibition to demonstrate. Harebrayne: We, we had to apply to the government for some sort of inspection to be allowed to exhibit, I think. I didn't understand all that side of things. Mr Asman took care of all of it. He was a wonderful man! Really, I owe him everything.Harebrayne: Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say that you built the machine together, does that mean that you were involved in its construction? Harebrayne: Yes! ...W-Well, not exactly... I'm not good with the practical side of machines myself. So the physical construction was done by an engineer. Van Zieks: Little remains of your creation now, though, following the explosion. Repair will no doubt be impossible. Harebrayne: Yes, yes, I realise that. But still... If, if someone were to gather all the broken parts, they could discover the secret of my hypothesis! But Mr Asman and I toiled over that machine for so long. We put our hearts and souls into it! I have to protect our work. So what's left of the machine must be kept safe! That's only fair! Because what happened was an accident!Ryunosuke: (That's the extent of the testimony then... Thank goodness for that. I don't want him doing any more damage. He's already basically proven that he could have been the culprit. But it seems as though all he really cares about is defending his hypothesis. Still, I wonder... What if his hypothesis is just fundamentally flawed?)Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis... ...nothing made of metal can be beamed by instantaneous kinesis using the machine you made. Is that right?Harebrayne: Yes, that's right. Spot on! Exactly correct!Ryunosuke: In that case...I'd ask you to have a look at this photograph that was taken at the scene. In particular, I'd like you to pay attention to the victim's face. You can clearly see that Mr Asman is wearing a pair of spectacles...with a metal rim.Harebrayne: What? Metal? No... Metal can't... That's not... M-Metal? NOOOOOOOOOOOO!Ryunosuke: We've already established that the proposed murder weapon, the screwdriver, was found on the stage. However, if your hypothesis correctly predicted that outcome... ...it should also have predicted...that the metal-rimmed spectacles would be found in the same place!Harebrayne: AAAAAAAAAAAAH! My hypothesis! MY HYPOTHESIIIIIIIIIS!Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, this isn't easy for me to say... ...but your hypothesis...is clearly flawed!Harebrayne: UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Counsel, what is the implication of this?Ryunosuke: If, on the day in question, the alleged instantaneous kinesis never actually took place... ...then it's entirely possible that the victim was killed somewhere other than on the stage. And in that case...someone other than the defendant could have been the culprit!Harebrayne: But, but my hypothesis! My hypothesis is sound! I proved it that day! The experiment was a success! The experiment was proof of all my work!???:Juror No. 4: If I could say something here, in my capacity as a fellow of the Royal Society...Judge: Yes, juror number four? Go ahead.Juror No. 4: As a man of science, there's one thing I simply cannot abide... And that's a fraud who PRETENDS to be a fellow man of science!Harebrayne: What? Wait! Great Scott! Are you suggesting my science is suspect?!Juror No. 4: It's just been disproved, hasn't it? In front of all of us. In other words, the whole demonstration was a complete nonsense from start to finish! Believe me, my fellow jurors, when I tell you that this man is a heel, a bounder and a fraud!Juror No. 1: I say the wreckage of that machine should be stripped down and thoroughly examined!Harebrayne: Nooo! Never! That machine is the essence of my entire hypothesis! It's protected by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act!Juror No. 6: What the devil is that blasted act all about, eh? Who made up such a daft rule?!Ryunosuke: (I don't like the way this seems to be going... What's the best way for me to help the professor?)Raise an objection Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention!\"Wait and see Ryunosuke: (Maybe I should watch and wait for the time being...) Juror No. 1: My feeling is that the machine requires a thorough examination. Juror No. 2: But what about this 'special dispensation' that's been mentioned? Oh gosh...this is all too much. Juror No. 4: If it's determined that the machine itself was the murder weapon, I think you'll find that act won't apply. Juror No. 6: Of course it was the murder weapon! Anyone can see that, as plain as day! Juror No. 1: So we're all in agreement, are we? That the machine should be stripped? Ryunosuke: ...! (If, if I don't do something, they'll...) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention!\"Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention! That would seem to be the case, yes. But even so...Van Zieks: Even so, what?Ryunosuke: Going to such trouble and expense to create a fake machine to display in public... He would have absolutely no reason to do such a thing!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: He had an obvious reason to do exactly that. For the research grant money.Ryunosuke: Ah!Juror No. 4: If the government was foolish enough to have deemed the man's ridiculous notion plausible... ...he and his conspirators would have received a handsome sum indeed.Harebrayne: C-Conspirators?Juror No. 2: What would be the value of such a grant? Ten pounds?Juror No. 4: You're an order of magnitude out, madam. Five hundred pounds a YEAR!Juror No. 5: Ooh arrrrrr! Ya could live 'andsome on that much for years!Juror No. 4: The Society's noticed an increase in bogus public demonstrations in the field of science recently. And plenty of scientists arguing with each other to get the largest slice of the funding cake. People's greed is plenty motive enough for murder, I assure you!Harebrayne: No no no! I haven't deceived anyone! Least of all the government! My hypothesis is sound! The science is sound! Please, you must believe me!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: No matter how unbelievable this hypothesis may seem to you, ladies and gentlemen... ...the fact remains that the victim was transported instantly to the Crystal Tower. Which means that the experiment...was a success.Harebrayne: Ah, Barok!Van Zieks: And therefore... ...the only person who could possibly have committed this murder...is the accused!Harebrayne: Ah. Barok...Ryunosuke: (Where is this heading? I have no idea...)Van Zieks: My Lord, if I may...?Judge: Yes, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: The prosecution would like to summon new witnesses to the stand.Judge: New witnesses? What would be the nature of their involvement?Van Zieks: They were spectators of the demonstration at the exhibition. Who were occupying special seats.Ryunosuke: Eyewitnesses?Judge: Very well, the court grants the prosecution's request. I should very much like to hear from eyewitnesses to the incident.Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance is clear. This experiment was no postiche. The accused killed the financier victim there on the public stage, before the very eyes of the spectators. Now, my learned friend...Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes?Van Zieks: It's time for you to make your own stance clear.Ryunosuke: (There's clearly a flaw in the professor's hypothesis. I can definitely see that. But where does that leave me...?)Judge: We shall take a short recess now. During which time, the prosecution will prepare its new witnesses to take the stand.Van Zieks: ...As you wish, My Lord.Judge: Good. In that case, court is adjourned for twenty minutes.To be continued...23rd October, 10:44 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberHarebrayne: M-Mr Naruhodo... ...what on earth were you playing at just now? Or rather... ...WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU PLAYING AT ALL ALONG?! MY HYPOTHESIS! MY AMAZING HYPOTHESIS! You've been picking holes in it from the start!Ryunosuke: Ah, sorry about that.Harebrayne: But you promised me! You, you said you'd prove that dratted explosion was an accident, not murder. You said you'd keep my precious invention from falling into anyone else's hands! But all you've done so far is try to undermine me!Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I did make you a promise, you're right. I said that I'd believe in you and fight for your freedom to the very end. But I also told you I was no scientist. I don't understand your hypothesis. The fact is, there's an undeniable flaw in your logic, isn't there?Harebrayne: Ah! But! If I just run through some equations... Yes, you see! It's because my work is incomplete!Ryunosuke: Perhaps it is. Nevertheless...a man died as a consequence, didn't he?Harebrayne: Oh. OOOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOOOO! ......... You're right. You're so right. It's all my fault... And I have no right to blame you for my failures. I'm a disaster! Not just as a scientist...but as a human being!Ryunosuke: Well...that might be a little over the top.Harebrayne: And while we're on the subject... ...wh-what about Barok? He's being awful!Ryunosuke: Claiming his old university friend to be a murderer, you mean?Harebrayne: He's a disaster! Not just as a prosecutor...but as a human being! Oh! But no! Wait! He's the Reaper, isn't he? Perhaps he's not classified as Homo sapiens any more...?Ryunosuke: (...Glad that's cleared up...) ......... Can I double-check something with you?Harebrayne: Ah. Yes? What?Ryunosuke: The machine and demonstration you prepared... They were based entirely on your hypothesis, I presume? There was no...trickery involved?Harebrayne: ......... I drew the plans for the machine with my very own hands. Every line was painstakingly drawn with the firm belief that science is the only future. So yes, it's true that my hypothesis hasn't reach [sic] maturity yet, but please, Mr Naruhodo...you must believe in it.Ryunosuke: ......... Alright, Professor, I understand.Bailiff: Counsel! Defendant! The prosecution's witnesses are ready to take the stand. Court is about to be in session again. Make your way into the courtroom, please!Ryunosuke: (It all hinges on that demonstration. If the professor's hypothesis is sound as he claims... ...it leaves him as the only person who could possibly have killed the victim. But on the other hand, Mr Sholmes was adamant...)Sholmes: A practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible.Ryunosuke: (So really, what should I be trying to prove here?)23rd October, 11:00 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready for the new witnesses to testify?Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord.Ryunosuke: As is the defence, My Lord.Judge: So, Lord van Zieks... ...I believe these next witnesses saw the demonstration on the day in question with their own eyes?Van Zieks: Indeed they did. And as luck would have it, one of them is a police detective. ...So the testimony we are about to hear can be considered highly reliable.Ryunosuke: (Perfect. A detective of all people...)Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance remains unchanged. Though it ended in tragedy, the demonstration on the day in question was scientifically sound. And consequently... ...the sole person with the opportunity to have committed this act of murder... ...is the only other individual to have been present on the stage at the time: the accused.Judge: Thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's position is clear. So, bring forth your witnesses now.Van Zieks: Bailiff, show the witnesses in. The witnesses whose proximity to the incident on the day in question will clarify the truth unequivocally.Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court to hear.Lune: My name is Balthazar Lune. I am...the impresario of all the hot-air balloons in vicinity of the esperimento stage.Gotts: Mein name ist Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond Ormstein. I have come to see ze Great Exhibition all ze vay from my home in Bohemia. ...I'm very rich.Gina: Inspector Gina Lestrade, Scotland Yard. I'm a great detective. Even 'Erlock Sholmes agrees. I was on security duty at the exhibition...and I got to go up in one o' them balloons! It was amazin'!Ryunosuke: (Gina...again. But she did mention that she'd seen the disaster from up in a balloon actually, didn't she? And she clearly loved every minute of it.)Van Zieks: There were three balloons flying near the public experimentation stage when the incident occurred. Two of these witnesses were in one such balloon at the time, and saw events unfold from the skies above.Lune: You make it sound like they were in the clouds. It was only an altitude of circa sixty feet. Very low.Gina: Well ya can't see nuffin' if ya fly too 'igh, can ya?Ryunosuke: (Sixty feet... About eighteen metres, then.)Judge: Thank you for your introductions. Now, you will give your formal testimony for the court. Kindly describe exactly what you witnessed...especially those of you who had a vantage point above the stage!Witness Testimony - The View From Sixty Feet Up -Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged.Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us.Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere!Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower!Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower.Judge: ...A most extraordinary collective account, I must say.Ryunosuke: Could I just clarify something? There's a detail in the witnesses' testimony that I've not heard any mention of until now. Specifically, that there were two explosions?Van Zieks: ...More precisely, two explosions in two separate places, yes. When the demonstration began, the balloon carrying the two witnesses was around...here. There were other balloons in the air nearby at the time carrying other passengers as well, to be clear. Then, as power was supplied to the machine for the demonstration, the first explosion occurred. The so-called 'birdcage' that contained the victim disappeared from the stage, and a moment later... ...the second explosion occurred, directly adjacent to the balloon carrying the witnesses. The birdcage appeared at the site of the explosion, subsequently to plummet down into the Crystal Tower.Gotts: I voz very surprised. Suddenly a cage appeared before my eyes viz a person inside. Ze blast voz so hot, but I didn't vant to miss a sing, so I kept my eyes vide! ...I still have lots of money.Judge: ......... Precisely who is this curious infant?Van Zieks: I'm told he is a young noble of Bohemian royalty. Apparently he disguised himself in order to steal unnoticed into the Great Exhibition.Gotts: Ja, I am here in London on a sightseeing trip viz my elementary school.Van Zieks: We will have the benefit of a child's point of view in the testimony.Ryunosuke: (Do we really need that?)Gotts: Ven I remove my mask, zis is vot I look like.Judge: Ah yes, I see. A delightful face, I'm sure.Gotts: Ja, everybody says so.Ryunosuke: (Great disguise, then...)Van Zieks: ...The point is, the testimony of these witnesses further substantiates the facts for the court. Namely, that despite ending in an explosion, instantaneous kinesis was successfully demonstrated. And furthermore, that until the arrival of the police, no one approached the Crystal Tower where the victim fell. Therefore, only the accused, who was with Mr Asman on the stage, could possibly have committed the murder.Judge: Yes, thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's views on the matter are quite clear. So, the defence's cross-examination now, please.Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The View From Sixty Feet Up -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

    "cot": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The testimonies are from the witnesses in the trial, and the evidence is the various items collected during the investigation.\n\nLooking at the testimonies provided, Testimony 3 is from Gotts, saying \"It voz not ze sky zat exploded. It voz a green balloon zat woz next to ours at ze time.\" So he's claiming that a green balloon exploded, not the sky. \n\nNow, the evidence list includes Evidence 8: Photograph of the Balloon, which is described as a photo taken by Gotts showing another balloon that he claims was green and exploded. If the photo shows a green balloon exploding, but in Testimony 3, Gotts says it was a green balloon that exploded, then that seems to align. Wait, maybe I need to check if there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe the photo actually shows a different balloon or something else. \n\nWait, no. Let me read the evidence again. Evidence 8 says: \"A photograph taken by Gotts whilst he was riding in a balloon. It shows another balloon that he claims was green and exploded moments after he took this shot.\" So the photo is supposed to support his testimony that the green balloon exploded. But if the testimony is that the green balloon exploded, but the photo might show something different. Wait, maybe the photo doesn't actually show the green balloon exploding. Or perhaps there's a detail in the photo that contradicts his statement. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe another angle. Let's look at the other testimonies. Testimony 2 from Gotts says \"And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere!\" But the evidence might contradict that. Alternatively, Testimony 3 where he mentions the green balloon exploding. The evidence that could contradict this is the Photograph of the Balloon (Evidence 8), which might not show an explosion or the green balloon as claimed. Or perhaps the photo shows a different color balloon.\n\nWait, the evidence description states that the photo shows another balloon that he claims was green and exploded. But if the photo actually shows a different color, or no explosion, that would contradict. However, according to the given data, the photo is as Gotts described. So maybe that's not the contradiction.\n\nWait, looking at other testimonies. Testimony 5 from Gina: \"I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower.\" But maybe there's evidence that someone did approach the cage. But the evidence given here might not include that.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 where Gotts says the green balloon exploded. But if there's evidence that the balloon was a different color or that the explosion was from the machine, not a balloon. Wait, the machine explosion is separate. The initial explosion was on the stage, and then a second explosion in the sky where the cage appeared. Gotts is saying that the second explosion was a green balloon. But maybe the evidence (like the crossbow or something else) shows that the explosion was caused by another means.\n\nWait, perhaps Evidence 17: Post-Explosion Photograph shows the experimentation stage after being blown up by a time bomb. If the explosion was caused by a bomb, then the testimony about the balloon exploding would be contradicted. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, Evidence 3: Mysterious Contraption \u2192 Crossbow. If the crossbow was used to trigger something, maybe the explosion wasn't from the balloon. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Testimony 3 says a green balloon exploded, but the photo (Evidence 8) shows a different balloon, or perhaps the timing is off. For example, the photo might have been taken before the explosion, showing the balloon intact, which would contradict the testimony that it exploded. But according to the evidence description, the photo was taken moments before the explosion. So if the photo shows the balloon intact and the explosion happened after, then there's no contradiction. \n\nWait, the problem here is that the user wants a pair where the evidence contradicts the testimony. Let me think again. \n\nTestimony 3: Gotts says the explosion was from a green balloon next to theirs. But Evidence 8 is a photograph taken by Gotts showing another balloon that he claims was green and exploded. If the photo actually shows the balloon exploding, then it supports his testimony. But if the photo doesn't show the explosion or the green balloon, then there's a contradiction. However, according to the evidence description, it's as he said. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe another angle. Let's look at the Experiment Sketch (Evidence 2). The diagram shows the positions of the Crystal Tower and the machine. If the testimony says the cage appeared in the sky next to the balloon, but the sketch shows that the distance was impossible, that could be a contradiction. For example, if the sketch shows the machine and tower are too far apart for the balloon to be in between, then the cage appearing next to the balloon might not align with the machine's position. \n\nAlternatively, the crossbow (Evidence 3) was found hidden under the stage. If the crossbow was used to cause the explosion in the balloon, then the testimony that the balloon exploded on its own would be contradicted. But how would that connect?\n\nAlternatively, the Piece of Green Cloth (Evidence 4) is a torn piece of canvas with rubber backing and scorch marks. If this cloth is part of a balloon, then it could indicate that the balloon was destroyed by an explosion. But if the testimony says the green balloon exploded, and the green cloth is evidence of that, then they support each other. \n\nWait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 (the green balloon exploded) and Evidence 8 (the photo of the balloon). If the photo actually shows a different color balloon, but Gotts claims it was green, that's a contradiction. But according to the evidence description, the photo is as he described. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the crossbow (Evidence 3) was used to shoot the balloon, causing the explosion. But the testimony says the balloon exploded, which could align. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the Photograph of the Balloon (Evidence 8) contradicts Testimony 3. Because the photo shows the balloon intact, but the testimony says it exploded. Wait, but the evidence description says the photo was taken moments before the explosion. So if the photo shows the balloon intact, but the testimony says it exploded, then they don't contradict. Because the explosion happened after the photo was taken. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something else. Let me check the other evidence and testimonies again.\n\nAnother possibility: Testimony 3 says the green balloon exploded, but the actual explosion was caused by the kinesis machine's malfunction. However, the evidence related to the machine's explosion (like the Experiment Sketch or the Post-Explosion Photograph) would show that the explosion was from the machine, not the balloon. But that's not directly linked. \n\nWait, another angle. The crossbow (Evidence 3) is a weapon found under the stage. If someone used the crossbow to trigger an explosion in the balloon, then the balloon's explosion wasn't accidental but deliberate. However, the testimony states that the balloon exploded, which could still be true regardless of the cause. So maybe not a direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 6) shows the victim was stabbed, but the testimony is about the explosion. That's not directly related. \n\nWait, the Screwdriver (Evidence 7) has blood on it, which ties to the stab wound. But that's separate from the balloon testimony. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to look for the most obvious contradiction. \n\nTestimony 3 by Gotts: \"It voz not ze sky zat exploded. It voz a green balloon zat woz next to ours at ze time.\" So he's saying the explosion was a green balloon. But Evidence 8 is the Photograph of the Balloon, which shows another balloon that he claims was green and exploded. If the photo actually shows a different color balloon, like maybe not green, that would contradict. But according to the evidence description, the photo is as he says. So no contradiction there. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the timing. The photo was taken moments after the explosion, showing the balloon intact? But the description says it was taken moments before. \n\nAlternatively, the Experiment Sketch (Evidence 2) shows the layout. If the balloon's position in the sketch contradicts where Gotts says the explosion happened, that could be a contradiction. But the sketch is about the machine and the tower, not the balloons. \n\nAnother thought: The green cloth (Evidence 4) is a piece of green material with scorch marks. If this is part of the balloon, then it supports the testimony. But if the cloth is from something else, like a different structure, then it contradicts. \n\nAlternatively, the crossbow (Evidence 3) is found hidden, suggesting someone used it to cause the explosion. If the explosion was caused by the crossbow, then the balloon's explosion was not spontaneous but a result of sabotage. However, the testimony only states that the balloon exploded, not the cause. So the cause being a crossbow doesn't contradict the testimony. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is Evidence 8 (Photograph of the Balloon) and Testimony 3. Because the photo shows the balloon, but according to the testimony, the balloon exploded. But the evidence description says the photo shows the balloon that exploded. So perhaps there's no contradiction here. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the testimonies again. Testimony 3 is Gotts saying that the green balloon exploded. But the evidence that contradicts this is the Post-Explosion Photograph (Evidence 17) which shows the stage was destroyed by a time bomb. But that's the stage, not the balloon. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is Evidence 8 and Testimony 3. Wait, the photo is taken by Gotts and shows another balloon he claims was green and exploded. But perhaps the photo actually shows a different balloon, or the balloon is not green. But according to the description, it's as he said. \n\nHmm. Maybe the correct pair is Evidence 8 (Photograph of the Balloon) and Testimony 3. Because the photo shows the balloon, which would support the testimony, but if there's a detail in the photo that contradicts, like the balloon isn't green. But the evidence says the photo shows the green balloon as claimed. \n\nI'm really not sure. Another approach: perhaps the answer is Evidence 3 (Crossbow) and Testimony 5 (Gina saying no one went near the cage after the crash). But if the crossbow was used to shoot at the cage, that would mean someone did approach. But the crossbow was found under the stage, not near the cage. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is Evidence 10 (Wooden 'Birdcage') and Testimony 4 (Lune says the cage fell like a stone and crashed). But the birdcage being wooden might not contradict that. \n\nWait, going back to the initial problem. The key contradiction here is that the witnesses in the balloon (including Gotts) claim that the cage appeared after the green balloon exploded. However, the crossbow found under the stage (Evidence 3) could have been used to trigger the explosion. But how does that contradict the testimony?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the green cloth (Evidence 4) is part of the balloon, but the crossbow was used to puncture it, causing the explosion. If the testimony says the balloon exploded on its own, but the evidence shows it was sabotaged, that's a contradiction. But the testimony doesn't mention the cause, just that it exploded. \n\nHmm. Maybe the correct answer is Evidence 8 (Photograph of the Balloon) and Testimony 3. Because the photo shows the balloon was green and exploded, which aligns with the testimony. Wait, but that's supporting, not contradicting. \n\nI think I'm missing something. Let me think again. The testimonies are from the witnesses about what they saw. The contradiction would be if the evidence shows something different. For example, if a testimony says there was an explosion in the balloon, but the evidence shows that there was no balloon there. \n\nWait, looking back at the evidence, the Photograph of the Balloon (Evidence 8) is taken by Gotts, and in his testimony (Testimony 3) he says the green balloon exploded. The photo shows the balloon, so it supports his claim. So that's not a contradiction. \n\nAnother possibility: The Experiment Sketch (Evidence 2) shows the positions of the machine and the Crystal Tower. If the cage was supposed to be transmitted to the tower, but the witnesses saw it appear next to the balloon, which is a different location. So maybe the sketch shows the intended path, but the testimony says it appeared elsewhere. That would be a contradiction. So Evidence 2 (Experiment Sketch) and Testimony 2 (Gotts says the cage appeared in the sky next to the balloon). But I'm not sure if the sketch indicates the intended path. The sketch's description says it shows the relative positions. If the intended destination was the Crystal Tower, but the cage appeared in the sky near the balloon, which is a different location, that would contradict the machine's design. Therefore, the Experiment Sketch (Evidence 2) would show that the cage was supposed to go to the Crystal Tower, but according to Testimony 3, the cage appeared next to the balloon, which is not the intended location. But Testimony 3 is about the green balloon exploding, not the cage's location. Wait, Testimony 2 says the cage appeared in the smoke. Testimony 4 says the cage fell into the tower. \n\nWait, Testimony 4 by Lune: \"The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower!\" So the cage fell into the tower, which aligns with the Experiment Sketch (Evidence 2) showing the tower's position. So no contradiction there. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The answer might be Evidence 8 (Photograph of the Balloon) and Testimony 3 (Gotts's statement about the green balloon). But why? Because the photo shows the balloon was not green, but he claims it was. But according to the evidence description, it does show the green balloon. So that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is Evidence 3 (Crossbow) and Testimony 5 (Gina saying no one went near the cage). If the crossbow was used to shoot the cage, implying someone did approach, but Gina says no one went near. But the crossbow was found under the stage, not near the cage. \n\nWait, maybe the crossbow was used to trigger the explosion from a distance. So the person didn't need to approach the cage. Therefore, Gina's testimony that no one went near the cage would still hold. So no contradiction. \n\nI'm stuck. Let me try to check the correct answer based on the game's logic. In the game, during this part of the trial, the contradiction is between the photograph of the balloon (Evidence 8) and Gotts's testimony (Testimony 3). The photo shows the balloon intact, but he says it exploded. However, the photo was taken moments before the explosion, so it's not a contradiction. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is different. In the game, the crossbow (Evidence 3) is used to fire a bolt that caused the explosion in the balloon. So the explosion wasn't from the balloon itself, but from the crossbow. Therefore, Testimony 3 (the green balloon exploded) is contradicted by the crossbow evidence showing it was a deliberate act. But how does that directly contradict? The testimony just says the balloon exploded, regardless of the cause. \n\nAlternatively, the green cloth (Evidence 4) is part of the balloon, but the crossbow's presence suggests the explosion was caused by sabotage, not an accident. But again, the testimony doesn't address the cause. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is Evidence 8 and Testimony 3. Wait, in the game, when presenting the photo of the balloon, it's revealed that the balloon in the photo is actually not green. Gotts claimed it was green, but the photo shows a different color, leading to a contradiction. So even though the evidence description says \"he claims was green\", the photo might actually show otherwise. Therefore, the evidence (photo) contradicts his testimony (claiming it was green). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So even though the evidence description says \"he claims was green\", the photo might actually show a different color, which the player can observe. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 8 (Photograph of the Balloon) and Testimony 3 (Gotts's statement about the green balloon). \n\nSo the JSON answer would be {\"evidence\": 8, \"testimony\": 3}."

There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look! Ryunosuke: What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: ...! Who are you? Ryunosuke: I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer. Harebrayne: A LAWYER! Ryunosuke: Agh! (Was it something I said?!) Harebrayne: A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?! Ryunosuke: Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't- Harebrayne: Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah... Ryunosuke: ......... (Now's probably not a good time to mention that your zeal made my concentration leave for a while, too...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: So, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct? Harebrayne: As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life! Ryunosuke: ......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Harebrayne: ......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything. Ryunosuke: Thank you for that, Professor. Harebrayne: And thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court! Iris: Alright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: Well, that's where the incident happened, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, I suppose that's true. (Time to investigate at last!) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Ryunosuke: Ugh... The showgrounds are a little too big for my liking... We've been walking around in dense crowds for two hours now, and I've felt myself swooning three times. Iris: There are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too! Ryunosuke: ...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. (We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.) ???: .........! ???: .........! Ryunosuke: (What's that...? I can hear voices from up on the stage. It sounds like an argument...) ???: Right, I've had it with you this time! I'm warnin' you, I'll arrest you in a minute! ???: Oh yeah? Go on then, 'Spector, give it a shot! You ain't got no evidence, an' you know it! Ryunosuke: (Wait... I know those voices.) ???: You've got a cheeky little mouth on you, young lady! But a night in the cells will teach you some manners! ???: Just try it, I dare ya! If ya want that bag o' chips rammed down yer throat! Iris: Yoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there? Gregson: ......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship? Ryunosuke: (...Does that make her three times a lady?) Iris: I'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue. Gregson: Unbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you! Ryunosuke: Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. (But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!) Gregson: Watch it, sunshine! Ryunosuke: S-Sorry... Gregson: What gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case? Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm acting for the defence. Iris: So we're here to investigate! Gregson: Hmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it? Ryunosuke: (Is it really that troubling?) ???: Tsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo! Ryunosuke: Wha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is! ???: Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob. Ryunosuke: This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court. Gina: Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya? Ryunosuke: I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground. Gina: That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's Inspector Lestrade now! Ryunosuke: In... Inspector?! (That badge is homemade, surely...) Gregson: The 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us. Iris: What's that supposed to mean? Gregson: Right, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright? Gina: Right...sir. Ryunosuke: (This... This raises a LOT of questions!) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Iris: Runo, Runo, listen! Ryunosuke: What? What is it? Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like? Ryunosuke: No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow! Iris: But that's where Hurley is. Ryunosuke: What? At, at this popular London attraction? Iris: Yes! Ryunosuke: How is it that you know where he is? Iris: Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Ryunosuke: So that's it, is it? The machine that blew up. Iris: Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share. Ryunosuke: You've seen things like this before, you mean? Iris: Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!' Ryunosuke: Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs. Iris: One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof. Iris: Well anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate! Ryunosuke: Ah look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully. Iris: Really? He just looks confused to me. Ryunosuke: It ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it? Iris: Magnificently...and mercilessly. Ryunosuke: So someone stands in the middle of the machine to be disassembled and then 'beamed' through the air... Iris: Yes, 'beamed' not 'blasted'. That's the point. Ryunosuke: (Yes, that part's crucial, really.) Is something like that even possible, though, Iris? Iris: Oh, Runo. I'm just a child. How should I know? Ryunosuke: (A child when it suits you, you mean...) Iris: From what I can tell, I think if you were to pull this lever here- Gregson: STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! Don't touch that! Iris: Ah ha ha! That was practically instantaneous kinesis the way you flew over just now, Gregsy! Gregson: Please, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here. Iris: So sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it. Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful! Ryunosuke: (It's just like old times, this is...) We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene! Gregson: Hah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, that special dispensation... (The professor mentioned that, too.) Gregson: More red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes. Iris: But...we're allowed to just look, aren't we? Gregson: Eh? Iris: Surely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy? Gregson: ......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! Anythin' you say, Your Ladyship! But please don't get your dainty hands dirty, will you? Iris: Don't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo? Ryunosuke: (She really knows how to get what she wants...) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Gregson: Right, are you done here, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gregson: Isn't it about time you were leavin'? Or rather...it IS about time you were leavin'! That lot are here now. Iris: That lot? Gregson: The Forensic Investigation Team. They'll be givin' me the heave-ho in a minute, too. Iris: Oh dear. Poor Gregsy. Here! Have another cup of my special blend to cheer you up! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! That hit the spot! Yup, hits it every time! Ryunosuke: (Well, at least I've seen the scene with my own eyes. It looks like this is as far as we're going to get with our investigations here at least...) Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.)

Prosecutor's Office Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Ryunosuke: Wh-What is this place? L-Look at all these t-terrifying scenes! But why are all the p-people so still? (Guillotines... Ruthless murderers... I know what I'll be dreaming about tonight.) Iris: They're all wax models. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked? Ryunosuke: W-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere! Iris: ...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif- Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Iris: What now? Ryunosuke: I've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display. Iris: None of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas. Ryunosuke: They can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them! Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: There's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait. Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: Oh...no... (I must be seeing things...) Ryunosuke: It's...it's... ...the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! (Mr Sholmes has his own wax statue in here? Really?) Iris: Well he is world-famous, after all! Ryunosuke: It's an uncanny resemblance, isn't it? It makes my skin crawl to look at it... Iris: I know! But look, Runo. You can kick this Hurley, and he doesn't move a muscle! Ryunosuke: You can't go around kicking the exhibits, Iris! .........Wait. It, it just moved, I'm sure. And not just a little bit, either! Iris: Hm? Really? Did it? Ryunosuke: And look closely... ...there are beads of sweat on the face...of this waxwork... model... ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Sh-Shall we move on, Iris? ...Over there, look! There's a great murder scene to enjoy! Much more appealing. Sholmes: Sholmes: My dear fellow! I take exception to your recoiling in such a manner, as if you've seen something truly abhorrent! Ryunosuke: Mr...Mr Sholmes! (I knew it!) Sholmes: Iris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Temporary waxwork? What do you mean? Sholmes: And that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me! Iris: But Runo has something he needs to ask you. Sholmes: Ah...a question? Iris: And I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are! Sholmes: Hm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax! Ryunosuke: ...Thank goodness we arrived in time. Sholmes: Indeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss! Iris: Oh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you? Ryunosuke: (He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.) Sholmes: Now that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing! Ryunosuke: Oh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry. Sholmes: And if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken. Ryunosuke: Really? Sholmes: Moreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now. Ryunosuke: (But...how could it be?) Sholmes: We shall speak again presently, my dear fellow. But for now, I must return to my work. Ryunosuke: (What, back to being a temporary waxwork exhibit?) Sholmes: ......... Well? What is it you'd like to ask me, then? Ryunosuke: Um. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks. Sholmes: Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust? And so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together. Ryunosuke: So I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person. Iris: I was sure that you'd know, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: You said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Sholmes...? (He's suddenly clammed up.) Sholmes: Well, it seems we've reached the unavoida- ???: Greetings... Ryunosuke: Oh! Ah...hello. (Where did she appear from? And what's she wearing? Could she look any more mysterious?) ???: I hope...you are appreciating my museum? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- (Not again!) Tusspells: My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork. Ryunosuke: Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Bien s\u00fbr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add. Ryunosuke: ...Is that significant somehow? Tusspells: I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi. Ryunosuke: Right... Tusspells: Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular. Ryunosuke: (That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.) Tusspells: I was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble. Iris: She sounds deadly serious. Ryunosuke: (That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?) Iris: Let's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean. Ryunosuke: Yes, I know, but... Iris: I'm so curious! I want to know what's happening here! Ryunosuke: (Haven't we got enough on our plate already?!) Ryunosuke: Um, I wonder...could I ask you something? Tusspells: Bien s\u00fbr... Ryunosuke: I'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. [sic] Some kind of incident, perhaps? Tusspells: ......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you? Ryunosuke: Oh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! (He's disappeared!) ???: ...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade. Ryunosuke: Ah! Th-There you are! Tusspells: Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down? Sholmes: My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead! Tusspells: ...! Sholmes: Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police. Tusspells: Why ever not?! Ryunosuke: (She's turned as white as a sheet...) Sholmes: Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance! Tusspells: ......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we? Sholmes: Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain? Tusspells: That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it. Sholmes: Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder? Tusspells: Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there! Sholmes: Nothing amiss, madame? What about the arm protruding ominously from under the curtain? Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens. Tusspells: ......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soup\u00e7on. Sholmes: I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak graveyard scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is nowhere to be seen. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor. Ryunosuke: Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself! Sholmes: I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit. Tusspells: Why...? Why would you say that? Sholmes: And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime! Tusspells: AAAAAAH! Ryunosuke: (She looks as pale as candle wax...) Tusspells: I, I don't understand... Sholmes: So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! 'Waxwork for sale'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold the infamous killer - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds! Tusspells: Nooooooooon! Sholmes: Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively. Tusspells: What are you suggesting?! Sholmes: He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret... Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Topic 2 Waxwork Location Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Such as is worn by policemen as a secret sign to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay. Tusspells: What are you talking about? Sholmes: The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards. Tusspells: But... Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame? Tusspells: I, I do not... Sholmes: Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ......... Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: I see I've stunned you all into silence. Iris: You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot... Ryunosuke: Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly ruthless murderer, wouldn't it? Sholmes: ......... The killer policeman, Ottermole. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether. Iris: And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole! Ryunosuke: So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be? Sholmes: Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well. Ryunosuke: But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model? Sholmes: It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective? Ryunosuke: S-So...it is quite a lot then. Tusspells: ......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down. Ryunosuke: (That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...) Iris: Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions... Iris: Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight! Ryunosuke: Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger! Sholmes: Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Ryunosuke: She definitely looked in this direction, it's true. Iris: But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds. Ryunosuke: Oh? Iris: She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything. Ryunosuke: ......... (For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.) W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance. Iris: Let's follow that furtive glance again and see if there's anything else that could explain it! The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Iris: Judging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all. Ryunosuke: (The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...) But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure. Iris: ...Then let's have more of a look around! Ryunosuke: The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note! Sholmes: Quite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork. Tusspells: Agh! Sholmes: Two hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it. Tusspells: The model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have... Sholmes: In summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is ransom money! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: So if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is? Iris: We could just ask him when he comes around. Ryunosuke: ...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris. Iris: Yes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down. Ryunosuke: Well, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around... What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious. Iris: Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?! Ryunosuke: ...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. (Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...) Ryunosuke: What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand! Sholmes: Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow. Tusspells: How, how could you...? Ryunosuke: The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's a left hand. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model! Tusspells: KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage. Ryunosuke: So you mean, that arm...? Tusspells: Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir. Sholmes: Hm, no small keepsake. Ryunosuke: Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms... Tusspells: I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson. Ryunosuke: You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back. Sholmes: And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our conclusion: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Kidnapped! Solved Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is a sign to other policemen that some crime is underway. Iris: A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard. Ryunosuke: ...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away. Iris: Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course. Ryunosuke: Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible. Iris: But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean... Ryunosuke: ...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet. Ryunosuke: Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub. Sholmes: No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model! Ryunosuke: I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes. Tusspells: He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man. Sholmes: Naturally! What other explanation could there be? Ryunosuke: And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it? Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Ryunosuke: A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known? Iris: It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money. Ryunosuke: (Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...) So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really? Iris: Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Iris: If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not. Ryunosuke: Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think? Iris: Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail. Ryunosuke: (If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...) Ryunosuke: The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch! Sholmes: Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard! Ryunosuke: ...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then... Sholmes: And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep. Ryunosuke: But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence? Sholmes: No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes! The secret sign used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway. Tusspells: Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such criminal activity happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective. Sholmes: So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth. Ryunosuke: The waxwork of the especially ruthless killer from the special exhibit has been kidnapped. Sholmes: And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Still a mystery! Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Tusspells: All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe. Sholmes: It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted? Tusspells: ......... Yes. Tragically, it was... Sholmes: Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please. Tusspells: ...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work. Sholmes: ......... The talents of a great detective could be put to better use, I feel, but as you wish... Tusspells: It was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death. Sholmes: And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction. Ryunosuke: But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks? Sholmes: ......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to the victims he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest. Iris: What do you mean, Hurley? Sholmes: Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration. Ryunosuke: Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with noble blood! Iris: Oh gosh! Sholmes: It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks. Ryunosuke: No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?! Sholmes: I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today. Ryunosuke: ......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past... Sholmes: Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit. Tusspells: I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you. ???: ...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here. Harebrayne: It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok. Van Zieks: It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places. Harebrayne: I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen... Van Zieks: ......... Tomorrow the court will decide. Harebrayne: Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it! Van Zieks: I must warn you... Harebrayne: Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you? Van Zieks: ...Yes. Harebrayne: ......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...? Van Zieks: What? Harebrayne: ......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart. Van Zieks: My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else. Harebrayne: Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok. Van Zieks: Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court. To be continued...\nThe Return of the Great Departed Soul TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 423rd October, 8:52 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberExamine evidence Armband Insignia on front Ryunosuke: This set of scales is supposed to be the symbol of a defence lawyer, I think. And it's set on a background of a sunflower design. ...Or was it a dandelion? ...Or a chrysanthemum, perhaps... .........Well anyway, no one should be judged on their knowledge of flowers...or lack of it. Inside of armband Ryunosuke: The name of the armband's owner is very finely embroidered here. 'Kazuma Asogi'... One day, when I'm back in Japan and I've earned my official law qualification there... ...I'll wear one band on each arm. ...That should make me a very well-balanced lawyer, I suppose.Ryunosuke: (I can't believe it's been six months since I was last allowed to work in court. And now here I am, back at the Old Bailey...)Harebrayne: Ah! M-Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Good morning, Professor Harebrayne.Harebrayne: I, I don't understand! It doesn't make any sense! The atmospheric pressure in here is off the charts! I've never felt anything like it! It's, it's crushing me!Ryunosuke: I feel it every time I'm here. That...gravity.Harebrayne: Well, this is Britain's highest court... But are you telling me it's filled with some kind of device that can actually control air pressure?!Ryunosuke: ......... I think it's probably all in the mind.Harebrayne: Ah. Yes, well...you won't let me down, will you, Mr Naruhodo? I'm counting on you in today's trial...to save my life! To save the secret of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine from being made public!Ryunosuke: Yes, I understand. (I know what I have to do. I have to establish that the explosion two days ago was nothing more than an unfortunate accident.)Harebrayne: Well, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, really. Justice will prevail!???: My commiserations, Mr Naruhodo. You appear to have been lumbered with a most tiresome case here.Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! I didn't expect to see you here.Iris: That was very mean, Runo, leaving me alone at home with Hurley. It took me at least an hour to wake him!Harebrayne: Ah... Oh... Ah... Is it...? Are you...? HEEEEEERLOCK SHOOOOOOLMES?!Sholmes: Indeed, sir. I am he. Heeeeeerlock Shoooooolmes.Harebrayne: Oh, I've heard all about your exploits, even whilst living in Germany.Iris: Ah yes. Randst Magazine is on sale in Germany, too.Harebrayne: This month's instalment was sublime! Your deduction in 'The Adventure of Silver Blaze' was wonderful!Sholmes: Ah yes, a memorable case indeed. It concerned a snake, I seem to recall.Iris: No, that was 'The Speckled Band.'Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for coming. I do appreciate your support.Sholmes: I'm sorry to disappoint you, my dear fellow, but I'm afraid I can't stay.Ryunosuke: Oh.Sholmes: I have urgent business at Madame Tusspells.Ryunosuke: You mean...your waxwork job?Sholmes: No no, the waxwork abduction, of course. Madame has engaged my services.Ryunosuke: Ah, so you're trying to get to the bottom of that ransom note, are you?Sholmes: The week's wages depend on it! ...As does the safe return of the waxwork, naturally. As such, I intend to give it my undivided attention.Ryunosuke: Oh, well, never mind then. I understand.Sholmes: Of course, with my skills of observation and reasoning, resolving the matter will be as easy as proverbial pie. I shall return forthwith. For until I solve the case, I shall have no money to afford a pie of any description.Iris: Ooh, then you must absolutely give it your full attention, Hurley!Sholmes: Quite, Iris, quite. But life is riddled with irony, you know. Whenever I give something my full attention, I have a quite insatiable desire for a pie. One of the universe's intractable mysteries, you might say.Harebrayne: Oh yes! Quite! Definitely! Absolutely! I totally understand!Ryunosuke: (...Is someone a little starstruck?)Sholmes: I wish you the very best of luck, Professor Harebrayne.Harebrayne: Oh! Ah! Ooh! Why, thank you!Sholmes: Before I depart, Mr Naruhodo...a word in your ear, if you please?Ryunosuke: ...? What's this about?Sholmes: As you have remarkably little grounding in science, I feel I ought to inform you... As compelling as this 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis' hypothesis may be... ...a practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible.Ryunosuke: But, but the professor said the demonstration was a success!Sholmes: Yes, it would appear that he fervently believes it was.Iris: I've read Professor Bunnybrain's paper about it, too, Runo. And I have to say... ...I'm sure it can't be done. It could barely be done theoretically, let alone practically.Ryunosuke: (So he's completely barking up the wrong tree?) But how could an experiment that had no possibility of succeeding in fact succeed? That's contradictory.Sholmes: And it's that contradiction that will be at the heart of the trial, I've no doubt.Ryunosuke: (What's that supposed to mean?)Sholmes: Now, I must hurry along. I wish you the best of luck, my dear fellow.Iris: See you later, Hurley! Well, it looks like you're on your own today, Runo. But chin up! You can do it!Ryunosuke: Oh! What about you, Iris?Iris: Ah, no, I'm afraid I can't help. I have something I need to do.Ryunosuke: ...I see.Iris: Hehe! It's going to be a big surprise for you when you find out what it is!Ryunosuke: Haah... (That sounds ominous...)Bailiff: Counsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Make your way into the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke: We're on our way! (An experiment that the laws of science say can't possibly succeed... ...and a scientist who's convinced that it did. That's the riddle you have to unlock here, Ryunosuke! That's the key to this case!)23rd October, 9:10 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are sitting today for the public trial of Professor Albert Harebrayne. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready.Ryunosuke: The defence is... The defence is ready, My Lord! ......... (I'm six months out of practice. And what's more... ...I'm without Susato-san today.) ......... (Ugh... Is it just my imagination, or does the air in here feel even more oppressive than usual?)Judge: So... ...I must say I recollect the victim of this case all too well. Mr Odie Asman.Van Zieks: Mr Asman was well known as a financier...though that was merely a front for his diverse criminal activities.Judge: It was only a month ago that the man appeared in court prosecuted by you, Lord van Zieks. But the jury unanimously found him not guilty.Ryunosuke: (Because every member of the jury had been bribed, by the sound of it. These powerful London criminals are prepared to go to extreme lengths to keep their freedom.)Judge: But two days ago, on 21st October, Mr Asman met his end. The work of the Reaper, was it?Van Zieks: ......... If that is how Your Lordship would describe divine retribution... But the fact remains that Mr Asman's death... ...was a direct result of the actions of the accused, Professor Harebrayne.Judge: Very well, then. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... You have been selected at random to represent the will of the people. Are the six of you ready to fulfil your societal duty?Juror No. 1: I'm most gratified to have been selected to carry out this important civic duty, My Lord.Juror No. 2: To have a man's fate in the palm of one's hand... Oh gosh! Oh golly! It sends shivers down my spine.Juror No. 3: Science experiments, magic, conjuring tricks, courtroom trials... All are nothing more than performances.Juror No. 4: Any spurious scholar that defiles the reputation of science deserves to hang!Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?Juror No. 6: ......... Wasn't like this in my day! Wasn't like this at all!Ryunosuke: ......... (That's...that's... ...the police killer Ottermole look-alike...again. And he's as exhausted as ever, it seems.)Judge: Now, as I'm sure you are all aware... ...the incident we are here to judge today tragically took place at the Great Exhibition, shortly after its opening.Van Zieks: Though the death toll could have been far worse. With the exception of the victim, no one was killed. Nevertheless, the dream of the science being exhibited rapidly turned into a nightmare for the spectators.Judge: A tragic turn of events. And as such, the eyes of all London- No, of the whole world will be on this trial. It is our duty to reach a swift and just conclusion, I feel. So...your opening statement please, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks: At the heart of this incident... ...is technology never before demonstrated anywhere in the world.Judge: One of science's latest developments, I take it? The government is keen to capitalise on the Great Exhibition to improve Britain's technological advantage.Van Zieks: The technology being demonstrated by the accused was described as 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis'.Judge: Good Lord!Ryunosuke: It's designed to 'disassemble' human subjects using extremely high-voltage electricity... ...and 'beam' them instantly to another location where they are subsequently reassembled.Judge: Is...is such a thing even within the realms of possibility?Juror No. 1: Well I don't believe it, that's for sure.Juror No. 2: Disassembling people with electricity? My goodness! How shocking!Juror No. 4: Hah! The whole idea is absurd! The hypothesis would never stand up to scrutiny!Judge: Sir, I believe you are a fellow of the Royal Society, are you not? An expert in your field?Juror No. 4: I am, and my word on the matter can be considered final. Instantaneous kinesis is poppycock!Ryunosuke: (So this expert and Mr Sholmes are in agreement. It's impossible...)Judge: What is the prosecution's view on the matter?Van Zieks: ......... The prosecution would assert... ...that the accused's instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a success.Ryunosuke: What?!Juror No. 4: What rot!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar!Van Zieks: The professor's hypothesis is currently under investigation by the British government. If it is deemed to have merit, a substantial research grant would be made available. The accused made use of the invention built on his new hypothesis to take Mr Asman's life... ...in order to be the sole benefactor of the grant.Ryunosuke: But, but...Van Zieks: This disastrous demonstration was no accident. It was carefully designed from the outset to end the life of the victim.Judge: Thank you, Lord van Zieks. The prosecution's stance is clear. But you will now bring forth witnesses to substantiate your claims.Van Zieks: ...Gladly, My Lord. Bailiff! Show the first witnesses to the stand!Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court.Gregson: Yes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division. I was on duty at the demonstration on the day in question and in charge of the followin' investigation.Harebrayne: ......... Albert Harebrayne! S-S-Scientist!Van Zieks: You were born in England, but have been carrying out research in Germany in recent years. Correct?Harebrayne: Yes. Yes, that's right. After graduating from university here in Britain, I went to work in Germany...and made an amazing discovery! Which is what brought me back! I had to demonstrate my incredible hypothesis at the Great Exhibition!Gregson: What you demonstrated was incredible alright. An incredible explosion!Harebrayne: But the science! The science was a success! The instantaneous kinesis worked! E-Everyone saw it! They must have done! Yes, there was the terrible accident, but... ...the demonstration of my hypothesis was a success!Gregson: Well, that much is undeniable. As shown in this photograph taken by the Forensic Investigation Team.Judge: This was taken inside the Crystal Tower, I take it? The centrepiece of the exhibition, no less.Gregson: That's right, My Lord. Seems the victim rammed straight into it.Judge: Hm, I see... Very well, submit the photograph as evidence.The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record.Gregson: As the court's heard, the victim of the incident was Mr Odie Asman. There have been a number of allegations made against the man, but puttin' them aside for the time bein'... ...he was the man who financed the research for the experiment and the demonstration itself.Judge: I see. So to summarise the situation... ...the defendant is accused of taking the life of the man who funded his work. Would that be correct?Gregson: Exactly.Ryunosuke: But couldn't it be... ...that the explosion was caused by some malfunction in the apparatus used for the demonstration?Harebrayne: That's right! That must be it! My splendid machine... My poor, splendid machine...Gregson: You saw it yesterday, didn't you? We can't even examine the wreckage thanks to the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act.Harebrayne: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! The wreckage?! THE WRECKAGE?!Judge: But that being the case, how can the facts be established? How can it possibly be determined whether this was an accident or a deliberate and malicious act?Van Zieks: Extremely simply, My Lord.Judge: I beg your pardon?Van Zieks: Isn't that right, witness?Harebrayne: Wha...? Sorry? ME?!Van Zieks: No. Your neighbour.Gregson: Yes, sir! It was murder, plain and simple. Anyone could state that with complete certainty.Ryunosuke: What?! (How can he possibly think that?)Judge: Thank you, Inspector. I think we had better proceed to formal testimony. You will explain to the court on what grounds you claim this experiment to have been a front for murder!Witness Testimony - A Front for Murder -Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck.Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake!Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!Judge: ......... An extraordinary business... In addition to suffering a broken neck, the victim was stabbed in the heart?Ryunosuke: (Information I would really like to have heard from someone other than the judge...)Gregson: The coroner says death would have been all but instant from a wound like that.Van Zieks: You could say, in fact... ...that the victim was killed twice by the accused.Harebrayne: No, no and no! That couldn't be further from the truth!Gregson: I have here the experiment plan document that was submitted to the security team. The victim stood himself inside somethin' called 'the birdcage', ready to be 'beamed' instantly... ...to the second level of the Crystal Tower, about twenty-five yards away.Van Zieks: The experiment did not go according to plan, however. As the machine was put into operation, there was a large explosion. The blast caused the beam transmitter to point higher than intended. Accordingly, the kinesis resulted in the birdcage materialising in mid-air... ...from where it subsequently fell, crashing through the glass of the Crystal Tower's large round window.Judge: My word... One assumes the victim's neck was broken upon impact with the tower, then?Harebrayne: I'm, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen! The machine was just too powerful! But honestly! Really! I swear! It was just an accident! A terrible accident!Van Zieks: Unfortunately, that excuse can't save you.Gregson: No, not considerin' the sharp murder weapon that pierced the victim's heart.Harebrayne: M-Murder weapon?! What are you saying?!Van Zieks: This is the autopsy report submitted by the coroner. The prosecution would like it entered into the Court Record.Judge: Your request is granted, Counsel.The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.Juror No. 4: I was there in person, you know. I saw the whole ludicrous performance. And the only other person on the stage with Mr Asman was that disgraceful excuse for a scientist!Juror No. 2: Then really, by all accounts it must have been him.Juror No. 1: Hmph. Hard to think otherwise, really.Judge: Very well. Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination, please.Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, My Lord! (I need to focus here... It's been a while!)Cross-Examination - A Front for Murder -Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Are you suggesting that's because he fell from a considerable height? Gregson: Exactly. Which highlights somethin' else about this whole rum business. Ryunosuke: What's that? Van Zieks: The fact that the instantaneous kinesis itself was a success. Ryunosuke: Ah! Gregson: After the explosion, the cage with the fella inside suddenly appeared out of nowhere in mid-air. Judge: So although the experiment ended in disaster, the so-called instantaneous kinesis did actually occur. Van Zieks: ...Remind us, Professor, what was the cause of the fatal disaster?Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So the angle of projection is critical, is it? And you calculated it yourself? Personally? Harebrayne: Absolutely! The calculation is far too complicated for anyone but me to carry out! Gregson: Only, you got it wrong, didn't you? Harebrayne: Yes! That's right! That's the point! The calculation is so complicated, even I can make a mistake! Ryunosuke: (Do people fall for that brazen confidence? ...I should try it.) Harebrayne: I, I took into account the subject's height and weight, the wind direction, the ambient temperature... I considered every possible variable! So I just don't understand how this could have happened! Ryunosuke: Obviously then, you had to include the weight of the clothes Mr Asman was wearing at the time, I suppose? Harebrayne: Ah. Crackling comets! The answer should have been three! Ryunosuke: (So much for safety first. The three must be for safety third...)Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Another fatal injury, you say? That doesn't make any sense! Gregson: I didn't think I'd have to spell this out, but here we go... Just because there were two fatal wounds doesn't mean I'm sayin' the victim had two lives to lose, does it? Ryunosuke: ...Too right. Gregson: Obviously at first, we thought the bloke had died due to his spine snappin' in half as well. Ryunosuke: But you're saying that's not the case?! Gregson: You'll get your answer once I've finished my fish an' chips...if you don't keep buttin' in every few seconds! Ryunosuke: (But we all know that's a bottomless bag...) Van Zieks: The victim plummeted thirty feet into a glass tower. It would be reasonable to assume that as the cause of death. Gregson: Right. That's what we all thought. But it was a red herring, wasn't it?Gregson: There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence knew nothing of this crucial information! Van Zieks: The prosecution received this report from the Forensic Investigation Team only this morning. That was the first we knew of it as well. I can only apologise for the impossibility of informing the defence. Ryunosuke: (Sarcastic AND insincere? Thanks...) So, what was the nature of this sharp object? Van Zieks: Among the accused's tools that were in use at the demonstration, one is of particular interest. This. Judge: Ah yes, that would appear to be some kind of screwdriver, wouldn't it, Couns- Harebrayne: AHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAH! There he is! My trusty little companion, Andrew! Ryunosuke: Andrew. Of course. Harebrayne: Ah, do you know each other already? He's one of my dear friends...like all my tools! I've named them all, you know. We're one big, happy family! Judge: ......... Harebrayne: Andrew is my flat-head screwdriver, of course. His brother, Michael, is a cross-head. Judge: Well, it would appear that your beloved 'Andrew' has a red stain on his shank. Ryunosuke: Ah! That, that isn't...? Van Zieks: It's blood, beyond all reasonable doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Gregson: And that's not all. The long, sharp shape of this Andrew fellow is completely consistent with the victim's wound. Harebrayne: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! The court will enter this 'friend' of the defendant as evidence! The screwdriver has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (So one of Professor Harebrayne's tools is the murder weapon...? Great...)Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence knew nothing of this crucial information! Van Zieks: The prosecution received this report from the Forensic Investigation Team only this morning. That was the first we knew of it as well. I can only apologise for the impossibility of informing the defence. Ryunosuke: (Sarcastic AND insincere? Thanks...) So, what was the nature of this sharp object? Van Zieks: Among the accused's tools that were in use at the demonstration, one is of particular interest. This. Judge: Ah yes, that would appear to be some kind of screwdriver, wouldn't it, Couns- Harebrayne: AHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAH! There he is! My trusty little companion, Andrew! Ryunosuke: Andrew. Of course. Harebrayne: Ah, do you know each other already? He's one of my dear friends...like all my tools! I've named them all, you know. We're one big, happy family! Judge: ......... Harebrayne: Andrew is my flat-head screwdriver, of course. His brother, Michael, is a cross-head. Judge: Well, it would appear that your beloved 'Andrew' has a red stain on his shank. Ryunosuke: Ah! That, that isn't...? Van Zieks: It's blood, beyond all reasonable doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Gregson: And that's not all. The long, sharp shape of this Andrew fellow is completely consistent with the victim's wound.Examine evidence Screwdriver Bloodied tip Ryunosuke: This...is blood. Mr Asman's, no doubt. This is the problem with looking at murder weapons... Handle Ryunosuke: I've seen this unusually shaped handle before. It's the same screwdriver that was lodged in the grille on the floor of the kinesis machine. (Which could be important information, so I should definitely make a note of it.) The details of the screwdriver have been updated in the Court Record. Handle (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: There's no question considering the unusual shape of the handle... This is the screwdriver that was poking through the floor of the kinesis machine. It looks a little bit like a capital 'A'. (For 'Andrew' I suppose...)Gregson: So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What grounds do you have for saying that? Gregson: Hah! D'you really need to ask? There were only two people on that public experimentation stage, in front of the whole crowd. Van Zieks: The victim, Mr Odie Asman, and the accused, Professor Harebrayne. And we know for certain that before the experiment, the victim was alive. Juror No. 4: That's right. I saw him with my own eyes! Van Zieks: Furthermore... ...following the explosion and 'kinesis', nobody went anywhere near the body. Gregson: In other words, only someone else on stage with the victim could possibly have done it. And Albert Harebrayne is the only bloke who fits the bill. Unless you've got some other bright idea, sunshine? In which case, let's hear it! Pursue Albert Harebrayne (after pressing fourth statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne! Do you have some information that may be relevant here? Harebrayne: ......... Ryunosuke: Professor! Harebrayne: Ah! Sorry! SORRY! I was just calculating the optimum coefficient of electrolysis to separate molecules in the human body... Ryunosuke: (And the witness stand is the best place for that?) It seemed as though you might have something to say? About Inspector Gregson's last remark. Harebrayne: Ah! AHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Yes! Yes, that's right! Of course! He just said that nobody else could have done it, didn't he? Gregson: Yeah, that's right. Who else could have stabbed the victim, eh? Harebrayne: I DON'T KNOW! ...But! There's no way that I could possibly have stabbed Mr Asman as you say. Gregson: Eh? Ryunosuke: Explain, please, Professor! Harebrayne: Of course. This cold-hearted policeman may not be aware, I suppose... ...but humans are warm-blooded mammals, with blood running continuously through their veins. Gregson: I had heard... Harebrayne: Then surely you see! If I'd plunged something the size of Andrew into the man's chest... ...the whole stage would have been a bloodbath! No, a blood swimming pool! Ryunosuke: Aah... Harebrayne: But thousands of Londoners were watching me at the time. And yet not one of them claims to have seen a swimming pool of blood! Gregson: ......... Well, no...I suppose not... Harebrayne: You see?! Not one! Juror No. 4: Hm... True, I didn't see anything like that... Ryunosuke: (Well done, Professor! That was a great counter-argument!) Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy if I savour a drop from my hallowed chalice to accompany my old friend's adducing. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Here's to you, Albert! Harebrayne: Oh, you're too kind, Barok! But I'm really not a patch on you... Van Zieks: No, you're not. Harebrayne: No? Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: You've neglected to mention one crucial possibility. Harebrayne: I have? Van Zieks: A particular situation in which very little bleeding would result from a stab wound. Gregson: Ah! Of course! Van Zieks: Inspector, enlighten the court, please. Gregson: Yes, sir! Ryunosuke: (Where are they going with this?) Judge: Very well. You will amend your formal testimony now, Inspector Gregson. Changes statement from \"So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!\" to \"The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air!\" Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: My learned friend's silence is your answer, Inspector. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Can't a man have a moment to think?)Gregson: The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Why would you think that, Inspector? Gregson: With any wound, it's only when you pull the weapon out that profuse bleedin' occurs. Whilst it's still lodged in the body, it acts as a stopper of sorts, for want of a better word. Ryunosuke: I, I see... Van Zieks: You don't need a medical degree to be aware of this fact. It's common knowledge for any investigator. Ryunosuke: (Ugh, where's Susato-san when you need her?) Gregson: If you ask me, this bloke masked what he was doin' from view with his body before stabbin' Asman in the chest. Then he beamed the victim off the stage with his fancy device, the screwdriver still where he planted it. Harebrayne: I, I would never do such a thing! Not to my precious tools! I would never use them for such dirty work! You only use tools for their intended purpose! That's common knowledge for any scientist! Van Zieks: ...The fact remains, the lack of blood at the scene can easily be explained. As the prosecution has demonstrated.Present Screwdriver (after examining handle) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding...\"Ryunosuke: (So that's all the testimony I have to work with... I had no idea the victim had been stabbed. That changes everything... Did van Zieks keep that to himself until now on purpose, to gain the advantage? Oh well...I suppose all I can do is press these witnesses for as much new information as possible.)Ryunosuke: You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding... Is that unequivocal?Gregson: Look, there was no blood on the experimentation stage, even though that's where the fellow was stabbed. The only explanation for that is if the screwdriver was still in his body, stoppin' any heavy bleedin'.Van Zieks: It's common medical knowledge, my learned friend. Even on your side of the world.Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, but about this screwdriver... The thing is, we actually saw it at the scene ourselves. On the experimentation stage.Van Zieks: What?Ryunosuke: It was on the floor by the wreckage of the machine, poking through a metal grille. I went to pick it up, but the detective here stopped me. Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson?Gregson: Ah, well, um... Now you come to mention it, yes...Van Zieks: Inspector, are we to understand that you permitted the defence counsel to investigate? That you contravened the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act?Gregson: Eh? No! Not at all! I, I wouldn't do that! I just let him look, nothin' more! I was very clear he wasn't to touch a thing!Ryunosuke: Yes, that's true. This screwdriver was in plain sight on the stage. But it shouldn't have been, should it?Gregson: Wh-What are you gettin' at?Ryunosuke: If this tool had still been in the victim's body when the victim was beamed away by the machine... ...then it shouldn't have still been on the stage.Gregson: Ah!Ryunosuke: That's right! It should have been beamed across to the Crystal Tower along with Mr Asman... ...and been found still lodged in the victim's chest!Gregson: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...How do you explain this, Inspector?Gregson: I...well...um... I don't...Ryunosuke: It looks as though everything that the victim had on his person moved with him when he was 'beamed'. If the screwdriver was still in his chest when the instantaneous kinesis occurred... ...obviously that should have been beamed to the destination as well!Gregson: You...Ryunosuke: (This is a strange situation... Even though people are saying that this instantaneous kinesis is a scientific impossibility... ...we're still basing arguments on the assumption that it did actually take place. Alright. Time to tighten the screws here...) My Lord! If the prosecution is unable to explain this inconsistency in its argument... ...we can only conclude that the testimony given in support cannot be relied upon!Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: (Lord van Zieks is stumped!)???:Judge: ...Do you have something to say, witness?Harebrayne: Yes...I knew it... It bears out... The equations hold... Mr Naruhodo! ...DON'T WORRY!Ryunosuke: ...About what?!Harebrayne: Without delving into the details, there is no inconsistency!Ryunosuke: What?Harebrayne: Even if Andrew had been lodged in Mr Asman's chest... ...my trusty tool wouldn't have moved. Andrew remaining on the stage is consistent with my calculations!Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Van Zieks: It would seem your illusions have been...shattered. Clearly we should hear the accused's explanation. ...Or should I say, this brilliant scientist's explanation?Judge: Hmmm...Ryunosuke: (Just when I'd found an inconsistency in the prosecution's argument... Scientists...)Judge: Very well! The defendant will testify again. Provide us with the scientific explanation as to why the inconsistency asserted by the defence fails to hold!Harebrayne: In the name of Apollo, I will, My Lord!Witness Testimony - The inconsistency Explained -Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together!Ryunosuke: .........Van Zieks: .........Judge: ......... So, the thrust of your testimony, Professor, is...?Van Zieks: ...That based upon his hypothesis, metal objects cannot be moved by this method of instantaneous kinesis.Judge: In other words...?Van Zieks: In other words, since the screwdriver is made of metal, even if it remained lodged in the victim's chest... ...its subsequent discovery on the stage despite the victim being found elsewhere is not an inconsistency.Judge: And therefore...?Van Zieks: And therefore Professor Albert Harebrayne could still have been the killer.Harebrayne: My great hypothesis holds, you see! We, we had to make the cage used to contain the subject from wood for that very reason.Judge: I was not addressing you, witness!Ryunosuke: Um...Professor Harebrayne...Harebrayne: Yes?Ryunosuke: Whose side are you on here?Harebrayne: I don't take sides, Mr Naruhodo! No no no! My only interest lies in upholding my hypothesis! I'm a scientist, after all!Ryunosuke: ......... (Is he working for us or against us? It's very hard to tell...)Van Zieks: Let's see how you cross-examine this testimony, my Nipponese friend.Harebrayne: Yes, fire away, Mr Naruhodo!Cross-Examination - The Inconsistency Explained -Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: And yet your retort to my argument wasn't lacking in confidence in any way. Harebrayne: 'No scientist can find the truth without first finding self-belief...' Those were the words of a certain scientist I hold in the very highest esteem! Ryunosuke: But you realise that disproving my argument puts you in a very precarious position, don't you? Harebrayne: 'No scientist should strive to protect himself more than he strives to protect the truth...' More words of the same great scientist, you know! Ryunosuke: ...Words that are causing me a lot of trouble. Who is this scientist? Harebrayne: I'm afraid I couldn't tell you, Mr Naruhodo. But, but as soon as I remember the magnificent genius's name, you'll be the first to know! Ryunosuke: It...might be worth keeping the names of your idols to mind? Van Zieks: You're wasting your breath, my learned friend. This scatterbrain even forgets my name at times. Ryunosuke: (...So Lord van Zieks really did have a friend once. But I didn't notice Hell freezing over...)Harebrayne: My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Your 'hypothesis' states it? So this isn't proven then? Harebrayne: No, no, of course not. It's merely a hypothesis. But a good one! Based upon thousands of calculations! But it is widely known that metals can't be decomposed by electrolysis. ...Yes! Of course! So I AM right! My hypothesis is clearly correct! Ryunosuke: (What is it about incriminating himself that makes this man so happy...?) Harebrayne: It's the whole reason that the birdcage is made of wood, you see. Ryunosuke: Sorry. The birdcage? Harebrayne: Yes, that's what I call the C. obtusa cage in which Mr Asman was placed for the kinesis. Judge: Ah, the jail cell in which the victim was detained. It does indeed seem to be made of a timber of some sort. Ryunosuke: (I'll thank you not to refer to it as an instrument of incarceration, Your Lordship...) Van Zieks: In short... ...any weapon lodged in the victim when he was beamed away by instantaneous kinesis... ...would have been left behind on the stage if it was made of metal. Correct? Harebrayne: Yes! That's it! Yes yes yes! It all fits perfectly with the mathematical model! Judge: But the ultimate conclusion then... ...is that the defendant alone had the opportunity to inflict this fatal injury on the victim, is it not? Harebrayne: AH! Judge: 'Ah!' indeed, sir. Ryunosuke: (Someone beam me out of this nightmare...)Present Photograph of the Victim Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis...\"Harebrayne: In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...You seem to be pleased by that. Harebrayne: Yes! Another example of my hypothesis holding true! But I sense some sarcasm, Mr Naruhodo. Are you not pleased? Ryunosuke: No. Harebrayne: ......... I knew it. At the end of day, I'm the one responsible for Mr Asman losing his life. The advancement of science is no excuse! I know that! Ryunosuke: No, you're quite right. Judge: Tell the court, did you have a close relationship with Mr Asman? Harebrayne: Oh, well no, not really. I mean, I'd only met him two or three times. And we only ever discussed my hypothesis and the project...and the research grant, of course.Present Photograph of the Victim Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis...\"Harebrayne: Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: How did you come to know Mr Asman in the first place? Harebrayne: ...A year ago now, a small provincial science journal published a little paper about my work. Judge: That's a scientific journal? Good gracious, I should need new spectacles! Harebrayne: I might have had an extraordinary hypothesis and great promise, but at the time, I had no money. I, I had to eat tiny little meals at a tiny little caf\u00e9 and drink watered-down water out of a tiny little glass... But...Mr Asman read the paper and came to visit me at my tiny little laboratory! Van Zieks: And offered you money to help fund your work? Harebrayne: Exactly! That's exactly what happened! I handled the theoretical side of things, and Mr Asman provided me with an engineer for the practical. ...And the three of us produced that fantastic machine together! Ryunosuke: The machine that you brought to the Great Exhibition to demonstrate. Harebrayne: We, we had to apply to the government for some sort of inspection to be allowed to exhibit, I think. I didn't understand all that side of things. Mr Asman took care of all of it. He was a wonderful man! Really, I owe him everything.Harebrayne: Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say that you built the machine together, does that mean that you were involved in its construction? Harebrayne: Yes! ...W-Well, not exactly... I'm not good with the practical side of machines myself. So the physical construction was done by an engineer. Van Zieks: Little remains of your creation now, though, following the explosion. Repair will no doubt be impossible. Harebrayne: Yes, yes, I realise that. But still... If, if someone were to gather all the broken parts, they could discover the secret of my hypothesis! But Mr Asman and I toiled over that machine for so long. We put our hearts and souls into it! I have to protect our work. So what's left of the machine must be kept safe! That's only fair! Because what happened was an accident!Ryunosuke: (That's the extent of the testimony then... Thank goodness for that. I don't want him doing any more damage. He's already basically proven that he could have been the culprit. But it seems as though all he really cares about is defending his hypothesis. Still, I wonder... What if his hypothesis is just fundamentally flawed?)Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis... ...nothing made of metal can be beamed by instantaneous kinesis using the machine you made. Is that right?Harebrayne: Yes, that's right. Spot on! Exactly correct!Ryunosuke: In that case...I'd ask you to have a look at this photograph that was taken at the scene. In particular, I'd like you to pay attention to the victim's face. You can clearly see that Mr Asman is wearing a pair of spectacles...with a metal rim.Harebrayne: What? Metal? No... Metal can't... That's not... M-Metal? NOOOOOOOOOOOO!Ryunosuke: We've already established that the proposed murder weapon, the screwdriver, was found on the stage. However, if your hypothesis correctly predicted that outcome... ...it should also have predicted...that the metal-rimmed spectacles would be found in the same place!Harebrayne: AAAAAAAAAAAAH! My hypothesis! MY HYPOTHESIIIIIIIIIS!Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, this isn't easy for me to say... ...but your hypothesis...is clearly flawed!Harebrayne: UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Counsel, what is the implication of this?Ryunosuke: If, on the day in question, the alleged instantaneous kinesis never actually took place... ...then it's entirely possible that the victim was killed somewhere other than on the stage. And in that case...someone other than the defendant could have been the culprit!Harebrayne: But, but my hypothesis! My hypothesis is sound! I proved it that day! The experiment was a success! The experiment was proof of all my work!???:Juror No. 4: If I could say something here, in my capacity as a fellow of the Royal Society...Judge: Yes, juror number four? Go ahead.Juror No. 4: As a man of science, there's one thing I simply cannot abide... And that's a fraud who PRETENDS to be a fellow man of science!Harebrayne: What? Wait! Great Scott! Are you suggesting my science is suspect?!Juror No. 4: It's just been disproved, hasn't it? In front of all of us. In other words, the whole demonstration was a complete nonsense from start to finish! Believe me, my fellow jurors, when I tell you that this man is a heel, a bounder and a fraud!Juror No. 1: I say the wreckage of that machine should be stripped down and thoroughly examined!Harebrayne: Nooo! Never! That machine is the essence of my entire hypothesis! It's protected by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act!Juror No. 6: What the devil is that blasted act all about, eh? Who made up such a daft rule?!Ryunosuke: (I don't like the way this seems to be going... What's the best way for me to help the professor?)Raise an objection Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention!\"Wait and see Ryunosuke: (Maybe I should watch and wait for the time being...) Juror No. 1: My feeling is that the machine requires a thorough examination. Juror No. 2: But what about this 'special dispensation' that's been mentioned? Oh gosh...this is all too much. Juror No. 4: If it's determined that the machine itself was the murder weapon, I think you'll find that act won't apply. Juror No. 6: Of course it was the murder weapon! Anyone can see that, as plain as day! Juror No. 1: So we're all in agreement, are we? That the machine should be stripped? Ryunosuke: ...! (If, if I don't do something, they'll...) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention!\"Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention! That would seem to be the case, yes. But even so...Van Zieks: Even so, what?Ryunosuke: Going to such trouble and expense to create a fake machine to display in public... He would have absolutely no reason to do such a thing!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: He had an obvious reason to do exactly that. For the research grant money.Ryunosuke: Ah!Juror No. 4: If the government was foolish enough to have deemed the man's ridiculous notion plausible... ...he and his conspirators would have received a handsome sum indeed.Harebrayne: C-Conspirators?Juror No. 2: What would be the value of such a grant? Ten pounds?Juror No. 4: You're an order of magnitude out, madam. Five hundred pounds a YEAR!Juror No. 5: Ooh arrrrrr! Ya could live 'andsome on that much for years!Juror No. 4: The Society's noticed an increase in bogus public demonstrations in the field of science recently. And plenty of scientists arguing with each other to get the largest slice of the funding cake. People's greed is plenty motive enough for murder, I assure you!Harebrayne: No no no! I haven't deceived anyone! Least of all the government! My hypothesis is sound! The science is sound! Please, you must believe me!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: No matter how unbelievable this hypothesis may seem to you, ladies and gentlemen... ...the fact remains that the victim was transported instantly to the Crystal Tower. Which means that the experiment...was a success.Harebrayne: Ah, Barok!Van Zieks: And therefore... ...the only person who could possibly have committed this murder...is the accused!Harebrayne: Ah. Barok...Ryunosuke: (Where is this heading? I have no idea...)Van Zieks: My Lord, if I may...?Judge: Yes, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: The prosecution would like to summon new witnesses to the stand.Judge: New witnesses? What would be the nature of their involvement?Van Zieks: They were spectators of the demonstration at the exhibition. Who were occupying special seats.Ryunosuke: Eyewitnesses?Judge: Very well, the court grants the prosecution's request. I should very much like to hear from eyewitnesses to the incident.Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance is clear. This experiment was no postiche. The accused killed the financier victim there on the public stage, before the very eyes of the spectators. Now, my learned friend...Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes?Van Zieks: It's time for you to make your own stance clear.Ryunosuke: (There's clearly a flaw in the professor's hypothesis. I can definitely see that. But where does that leave me...?)Judge: We shall take a short recess now. During which time, the prosecution will prepare its new witnesses to take the stand.Van Zieks: ...As you wish, My Lord.Judge: Good. In that case, court is adjourned for twenty minutes.To be continued...23rd October, 10:44 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberHarebrayne: M-Mr Naruhodo... ...what on earth were you playing at just now? Or rather... ...WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU PLAYING AT ALL ALONG?! MY HYPOTHESIS! MY AMAZING HYPOTHESIS! You've been picking holes in it from the start!Ryunosuke: Ah, sorry about that.Harebrayne: But you promised me! You, you said you'd prove that dratted explosion was an accident, not murder. You said you'd keep my precious invention from falling into anyone else's hands! But all you've done so far is try to undermine me!Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I did make you a promise, you're right. I said that I'd believe in you and fight for your freedom to the very end. But I also told you I was no scientist. I don't understand your hypothesis. The fact is, there's an undeniable flaw in your logic, isn't there?Harebrayne: Ah! But! If I just run through some equations... Yes, you see! It's because my work is incomplete!Ryunosuke: Perhaps it is. Nevertheless...a man died as a consequence, didn't he?Harebrayne: Oh. OOOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOOOO! ......... You're right. You're so right. It's all my fault... And I have no right to blame you for my failures. I'm a disaster! Not just as a scientist...but as a human being!Ryunosuke: Well...that might be a little over the top.Harebrayne: And while we're on the subject... ...wh-what about Barok? He's being awful!Ryunosuke: Claiming his old university friend to be a murderer, you mean?Harebrayne: He's a disaster! Not just as a prosecutor...but as a human being! Oh! But no! Wait! He's the Reaper, isn't he? Perhaps he's not classified as Homo sapiens any more...?Ryunosuke: (...Glad that's cleared up...) ......... Can I double-check something with you?Harebrayne: Ah. Yes? What?Ryunosuke: The machine and demonstration you prepared... They were based entirely on your hypothesis, I presume? There was no...trickery involved?Harebrayne: ......... I drew the plans for the machine with my very own hands. Every line was painstakingly drawn with the firm belief that science is the only future. So yes, it's true that my hypothesis hasn't reach [sic] maturity yet, but please, Mr Naruhodo...you must believe in it.Ryunosuke: ......... Alright, Professor, I understand.Bailiff: Counsel! Defendant! The prosecution's witnesses are ready to take the stand. Court is about to be in session again. Make your way into the courtroom, please!Ryunosuke: (It all hinges on that demonstration. If the professor's hypothesis is sound as he claims... ...it leaves him as the only person who could possibly have killed the victim. But on the other hand, Mr Sholmes was adamant...)Sholmes: A practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible.Ryunosuke: (So really, what should I be trying to prove here?)23rd October, 11:00 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready for the new witnesses to testify?Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord.Ryunosuke: As is the defence, My Lord.Judge: So, Lord van Zieks... ...I believe these next witnesses saw the demonstration on the day in question with their own eyes?Van Zieks: Indeed they did. And as luck would have it, one of them is a police detective. ...So the testimony we are about to hear can be considered highly reliable.Ryunosuke: (Perfect. A detective of all people...)Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance remains unchanged. Though it ended in tragedy, the demonstration on the day in question was scientifically sound. And consequently... ...the sole person with the opportunity to have committed this act of murder... ...is the only other individual to have been present on the stage at the time: the accused.Judge: Thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's position is clear. So, bring forth your witnesses now.Van Zieks: Bailiff, show the witnesses in. The witnesses whose proximity to the incident on the day in question will clarify the truth unequivocally.Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court to hear.Lune: My name is Balthazar Lune. I am...the impresario of all the hot-air balloons in vicinity of the esperimento stage.Gotts: Mein name ist Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond Ormstein. I have come to see ze Great Exhibition all ze vay from my home in Bohemia. ...I'm very rich.Gina: Inspector Gina Lestrade, Scotland Yard. I'm a great detective. Even 'Erlock Sholmes agrees. I was on security duty at the exhibition...and I got to go up in one o' them balloons! It was amazin'!Ryunosuke: (Gina...again. But she did mention that she'd seen the disaster from up in a balloon actually, didn't she? And she clearly loved every minute of it.)Van Zieks: There were three balloons flying near the public experimentation stage when the incident occurred. Two of these witnesses were in one such balloon at the time, and saw events unfold from the skies above.Lune: You make it sound like they were in the clouds. It was only an altitude of circa sixty feet. Very low.Gina: Well ya can't see nuffin' if ya fly too 'igh, can ya?Ryunosuke: (Sixty feet... About eighteen metres, then.)Judge: Thank you for your introductions. Now, you will give your formal testimony for the court. Kindly describe exactly what you witnessed...especially those of you who had a vantage point above the stage!Witness Testimony - The View From Sixty Feet Up -Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged.Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us.Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere!Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower!Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower.Judge: ...A most extraordinary collective account, I must say.Ryunosuke: Could I just clarify something? There's a detail in the witnesses' testimony that I've not heard any mention of until now. Specifically, that there were two explosions?Van Zieks: ...More precisely, two explosions in two separate places, yes. When the demonstration began, the balloon carrying the two witnesses was around...here. There were other balloons in the air nearby at the time carrying other passengers as well, to be clear. Then, as power was supplied to the machine for the demonstration, the first explosion occurred. The so-called 'birdcage' that contained the victim disappeared from the stage, and a moment later... ...the second explosion occurred, directly adjacent to the balloon carrying the witnesses. The birdcage appeared at the site of the explosion, subsequently to plummet down into the Crystal Tower.Gotts: I voz very surprised. Suddenly a cage appeared before my eyes viz a person inside. Ze blast voz so hot, but I didn't vant to miss a sing, so I kept my eyes vide! ...I still have lots of money.Judge: ......... Precisely who is this curious infant?Van Zieks: I'm told he is a young noble of Bohemian royalty. Apparently he disguised himself in order to steal unnoticed into the Great Exhibition.Gotts: Ja, I am here in London on a sightseeing trip viz my elementary school.Van Zieks: We will have the benefit of a child's point of view in the testimony.Ryunosuke: (Do we really need that?)Gotts: Ven I remove my mask, zis is vot I look like.Judge: Ah yes, I see. A delightful face, I'm sure.Gotts: Ja, everybody says so.Ryunosuke: (Great disguise, then...)Van Zieks: ...The point is, the testimony of these witnesses further substantiates the facts for the court. Namely, that despite ending in an explosion, instantaneous kinesis was successfully demonstrated. And furthermore, that until the arrival of the police, no one approached the Crystal Tower where the victim fell. Therefore, only the accused, who was with Mr Asman on the stage, could possibly have committed the murder.Judge: Yes, thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's views on the matter are quite clear. So, the defence's cross-examination now, please.Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The View From Sixty Feet Up -Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: There were three balloons flying above the experimentation stage at the time, I understand? Lune: Si, si. All three of them, my bellissimi bambini. They are very popular, signor. Some people will pay ten pounds for one ride. Ryunosuke: Ten pounds?! That's more than my annual stipend! Gotts: Twenty pounds a month. Zat is my pocket money. Ryunosuke: (Royals have all the luck...) Gina: I got up there for free, I did. Played the old 'I work for 'Er Majesty's Police' card, ya know. Ryunosuke: (Detectives have all the luck...) If they're so popular, why would you only be operating such a small number of balloons, though? Lune: Because...if I have too many in the skies, they could crash into each other. Van Zieks: The operators for the balloons were decided by lots, with each operator manning a particular area. Lune: Si! And the zone above public esperimentation stage is the most profitable! The other impresarios, they hate me! Judge: Thank you, witness. I think the court has a clear picture of the arrangements for balloon rides at the exhibition. Perhaps we could hear more about what you actually witnessed of the incident? Gina: Right! I can fill you in there, My Lord.Present Piece of Green Cloth (after pursuing Gotts correctly) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Mr Lune, in your testimony...\"Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you actually saw the accident happen from up in the air? Gina: Yup! Innit amazin' wot a detective gets to do, eh? I'm tellin' ya, 'Oddo, bein' a lawyer's a mug's game. You should join the force an' we can go flyin' together! Ryunosuke: (You know me so well...) Yes, well, anyway... Could you tell us exactly what you saw, do you think? Gina: Everyfin'! We saw everyfin', cos we were up above it all. That dodgy cove climbin' into that cage, an' that dodgy professor pullin' all them levers... An' that's when it 'appened! That's when there was that massive bang an' the cage disappeared! Just like that! Judge: Hm...you are describing the moment the subject's body was decomposed by the electricity, I believe. Gina: I didn't know wot to make of it. But then there was another bang! Right in me ear! I looked round, an' there was a huge great fireball right next to us in the sky! An' there was nuffin' there before! An' wot appears out the flames? The cage, that's wot! Pursue Gotts (before changing third statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um, er...Master Gotts! Does your memory of the day differ? Gotts: ......... Mein teacher at elementary school said zat ven you meet somevun for ze first time... ...you should alvays use zer full name. Ryunosuke: Ah, yes, um...what was it again? Gotts: Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond Ormstein. Ryunosuke: Just the four names then...? The point is, do you have something to say? Something to add in response to Detective Gina Lestrade's last remark, perhaps? Gina: Oi! Get it right, 'Oddo! It's Inspector Lestrade! Ryunosuke: (Why does everyone have a problem with how I address them at the moment?) Gotts: ......... Zat is not vot I saw. Ryunosuke: Oh? Gotts: Ja, zere voz a second explosion and it voz right beside our balloon. Zat is true. But I'm sure- Gina: Which is wot I said, innit? One minute there was nuffin' there, the next a massive explosion! Gotts: Mein teacher at elementary school said zat ven somevun else is speaking... ...if you are rude enough to interrupt...you vill have ze most awful life imaginable! Ryunosuke: (Are all Bohemians brought up to be so full of joy?) Gotts: Just before ze second explosion happened next to our balloon, I clearly vitnessed... ...a green balloon flying in ze sky. Ryunosuke: A green balloon? Gina: Eh? You wot? I never saw nuffin' like that. Gotts: Vell I did! I saw it! And you can't say I didn't! I vill complain to ze Consul! I vill cry and scream! My testimony is ze truth! I am Bohemian prince! You cannot say it's a lie! Zat is not allowed! Gina: ...Tsk, playin' the bleedin' royalty card, are ya? Typical. Ryunosuke: (Says the orphan who likes to remind people she works for 'Her Majesty's Police'...) Judge: In that case, young man, I must ask you to amend your formal testimony. In the interests of cordial national relations between Great Britain and Bohemia... Changes statement from \"And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere!\" to \"It voz not ze sky zat exploded. It voz a green balloon zat woz next to ours at ze time.\" Judge: Hm...and that description sounds like the moment after the man was 'beamed' instantaneously through space. Gina: It's mind-blowin', innit?! But that's the twentieth century for ya, I reckon! Ryunosuke: (So the people who actually saw the demonstration with their own eyes... ...really believe they saw something miraculous taking place.)Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you're saying that you witnessed the actual moment that the instantaneous kinesis took place? Gotts: During zis stay in London, I have seen many extraordinary sings. Ze Great Exhibition itself, zis instantaneous kinesis, big explosions, ze British courtrooms and strange creatures. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Strange creatures? Gotts: Ja, you. A most unusual creature from ze East. Ryunosuke: ...Oh yes, but I see princes wearing masks every day of the week. Van Zieks: Did you also see the moment that the cage materialised, Mr Lune? Lune: No no. I did not see the esplosione myself. However...Gotts: It voz not ze sky zat exploded. It voz a green balloon zat woz next to ours at ze time.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A green balloon, you say? Are you sure about that? Gotts: Of course I am sure! I am a proud Bohemian prince! All zese questions are making me boring. Ryunosuke: ......... I think you mean 'bored'. Gotts: Ach, English is very annoying! Ze language of my countrymen is far superior. Lune: Ragazzo, it is very wrong to lie. Gotts: Lie?! Lune: Flying balloons never explode. For the same reason the planets never explode. It is logico! Ryunosuke: ...Please tell me that doesn't mean logical... Gotts: If you insult me, you insult all of Bohemia! Lune: Ma dai! Gotts: I vill have ze army come and shoot all of your stupid balloons out of ze sky! All of zem! Lune: ......... ...Here you are, Your Highness. Ryunosuke: (If only all international incidents were so easily resolved...) Van Zieks: Now that peaceful relations have been restored here in the courtroom, perhaps we could return to the testimony? Did you also see the moment that the cage materialised, Mr Lune? Lune: No no. I did not see the esplosions myself. However...Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Did you see that actually happen? Lune: Eh, no, in reality I did not. I saw after it hit the tower. There was a grande confusione around the stage. I ran to see what had happened. I was terrorised by the idea that one of my balloons had crashed! Ryunosuke: (I suppose they are his livelihood...) Lune: But when I looked up to the sky, all my precious balloons were still there! Gina: I saw it, though. I saw it slam into the tower! After all, I am a detective now! Ryunosuke: Then tell us what you saw...Inspector Lestrade. Gina: That's wot I like to 'ear!Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Was it you who gave the order to keep people away? Gina: Eh? Use yer 'ead, 'Oddo! 'Ow could it 'ave been me? I was up in a balloon, weren't I? Ryunosuke: ...Right. Gina: So cos I weren't available, it was the boss who 'ad to leg it over there. 'E was gettin' shoved an' kicked all over by the panickin' spectators as 'e tried to seal off the scene. It was a real sight to behold, I can tell ya! Amazin'! Ryunosuke: (Poor Inspector Gregson...) Gina: So anyway, I couldn't see the cage that well cos of all the smoke. And I didn't really wanna see, to be honest. I was scared out me wits... Ryunosuke: Keep it together, Inspector...Ryunosuke: (The prosecution really is asserting that the demonstration was genuine... But what if it was actually some kind of switch-around trick instead? That would mean that the victim was never actually on the stage in the first place. The two explosions would have thrown everyone watching into a panic for sure. I think I need to find out more about what exactly people saw at the time...)Ryunosuke: Mr Lune, in your testimony... ...you said that all three of the balloons you had operating at the time were undamaged.Lune: Si. That is correct. If they had been caught in the esplosiones, it would have been terribile.Ryunosuke: I wonder...if you might know what this is?Lune: Ah...I think it may be... Si, part of a balloon. A burnt piece of the fabric of the envelope.Ryunosuke: Sorry? The envelope?Lune: Pardon. That is the large, round part of the balloon which becomes filled with hot air. It is made from very thick fabric lined with rubber. You do not want it to rip when you are in the sky.Ryunosuke: (Just as I thought...) This piece of cloth was found near the experimentation stage. In other words, as Master Gotts testified... ...a green balloon did indeed explode that day.Lune: Eh?!Ryunosuke: If all the balloons in the sky above the experimentation stage belonged to you, Mr Lune... ...then your statement that they were all undamaged clearly contradicts the evidence!Lune: NOOOOOOOOO!If a balloon exploded that day, why didn't the man say so? Maybe everyone on board was killed... Oh no! Having just spent ten whole pounds for the experience?! How awful! Seems to me like those things crash fifty percent of the time anyway...Van Zieks:Van Zieks: The instantaneous kinesis did occur! But after the explosion on the stage... ...the point of materialisation shifted to a location occupied by a balloon.Judge: Causing the balloon to explode? Yes, eminently plausible.Van Zieks: An unfortunate traffic accident, as it were. But it changes nothing about the pertinent facts.???:Lune: This, I cannot accept!Ryunosuke: Why not, Mr Lune?Lune: You are suggesting that I am a liar! That persons died in a balloon incidente!Van Zieks: There's no need to get 'fired up', Mr Lune. The victim was the sole fatality that day.Lune: That's right! And I prove it! Balthazar Lune is not a liar! There was no such balloon in the sky! It is non possible!Ryunosuke: You're saying it's impossible? Why?Van Zieks: This court has more important matters to discuss than the number of balloons that were operating that day.Lune: AIIIIIIEEE!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But we can't ignore the fact that nobody appears to have known anything about this other balloon until now! My Lord! The defence calls for further testimony from Mr Lune!Judge: I concur. There is clearly more to the truth here than meets the eye. It's imperative that we clear up the issue of this phantom balloon, I feel. Witness, you will give supplementary testimony about the balloons you were operating at the exhibition.Lune: Ah...grazie, My Lord!Witness Testimony - Mr Lune's Balloons -Lune: As I said, Balthazar Lune is no liar! Every balloon I had in the sky landed safely! All three of my balloons were carrying passengers. If they fell to the ground in an esplosione, what a catastrofe!Gina: But ya can't get away from the fact that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene, can ya? The coppers at the Yard reckoned it was prob'ly some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage.Lune: This stupido ragazzo is mistaken! My balloons have the red and blue zigzag stripes anyway!Judge: Hmmm...so your assertion is that the balloon this child saw was not one belonging to you?Lune: Si! Exactamente! If he even saw a balloon in the first place. I do not like the sound of it. It is very bad for business! I have a good mind to sue the land of Bohemia!Gotts: If you attack us, ve vill fight back! It vill be vor! All out vor!Ryunosuke: (...What happened to 'all out war'? Mr Lune certainly doesn't appear to be lying. But that doesn't change the fact that the testimony and evidence are contradictory here...)Van Zieks: If the defence is unable to find fault with the witnesses' statements, the court must consider them the truth. ...Think long and hard on that, my learned friend.Ryunosuke: (The situation has clearly changed now. I have to get to the bottom of what happened here, no matter what it takes!)Judge: Counsel, you may now cross-examine the witnesses.Cross-Examination - Mr Lune's Balloons -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

    "cot": "Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence contradicts which testimony here. Let's look at the testimonies and the evidences provided.\n\nThe testimonies given by Lune and Gina are part of the cross-examination about Mr. Lune's balloons. Testimony 0 by Lune says he's no liar and all his balloons landed safely. Testimony 1 adds that all three balloons had passengers, so if any exploded, it would be a catastrophe. Gina in Testimony 2 mentions the burnt cloth found at the scene, and Testimony 3 says the police thought it was debris from the stage explosion. Lune in Testimony 4 insists his balloons have red and blue zigzag stripes, not green.\n\nNow, the evidence list includes Evidence 4: Piece of Green Cloth, which is a torn piece of green canvas-like material with scorch marks found under the stage. Also, Evidence 8: Photograph of the Balloon shows a green balloon that exploded, as per Gotts' testimony.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Lune claims all his balloons were safe and had red/blue stripes (Testimony 4). However, the green cloth (Evidence 4) and the photo (Evidence 8) suggest a green balloon exploded. This directly contradicts Lune's statement that his balloons have red/blue stripes and none exploded. Therefore, the green cloth evidence (4) contradicts Lune's testimony (4) about the balloon colors and their safety."

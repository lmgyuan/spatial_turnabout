Today...we unravel everything!) I'll be counting on your support more than ever today, Miss Susato!Susato: .........Ryunosuke: Um... Miss Susato?Susato: Ah! Oh no! W-What's the matter, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Um...nothing? I was just saying that I'll be relying on your support today, but...Susato: I'm so sorry! Of course! I, I know I can be rather incompetent at times, but... ...I shan't let you down!Ryunosuke: ...Would you mind helping me to my feet, then?Susato: Oh dear! I'm really very sorry!Ryunosuke: (Susato-san isn't her usual self at all. But that's hardly surprising, I suppose. She's just found out that her father is the partner of a world-famous detective. Not to mention...)Susato: Ah! G-Good morning, sir!Ryunosuke: ...! Lord van Zieks!Van Zieks: Thank you for all your efforts yesterday.Ryunosuke: Wha... (Did I hear that correctly?)Van Zieks: ...What?Ryunosuke: Oh! Um, no, nothing. Just...I hope we can clear things up today. (I really can't make this man out. His face says 'I hate you' but his words are...almost jovial today. In fact, he hasn't been very Reaper-like at all since this all began yesterday.)Susato: Lord van Zieks isn't the Reaper, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: ...Good point.Van Zieks: The Reaper? I suppose in hindsight... ...I shouldn't have allowed that misconception to go unchallenged.Ryunosuke: Huh?Van Zieks: It was my tacit acceptance of the pseudonym... My failure to stop the Reaper becoming something more than a mere legend...that led to all this.Susato: But you're not to blame for that, Lord van Zieks!Ryunosuke: It's only because serious crime in the capital dropped off so sharply when the public started calling you that. That's why you didn't say anything, isn't it?Van Zieks: ...To be frank, I'm not sure that was the sole reason.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Van Zieks: There was a rumour at the time that the Reaper was really the ghost of my late brother.Susato: ...!Van Zieks: That having been slain by that evil killer, Klint's restless spirit returned as some sort of demigod... ...to wield a deadly blade of justice where I, by dint of the law, could not.Ryunosuke: Yes...we've heard that story too.Van Zieks: When I lost him... ...I felt as though I'd lost my guiding light.  I didn't know where to go or what to do. And so... ...in some small way, I wonder if perhaps those rumours made me feel his absence a little less keenly. Even if I knew it was just an illusion. Just some nonsense conjured up by an over-imaginative public.Susato: He was obviously extremely important to you. Lord Klint van Zieks...Ryunosuke: Well...what's important now is uncovering the truth. That's all that matters. I...know that you didn't take anyone's life.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: And I intend to prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt in court today.Van Zieks: ......... I never thought I'd say this... ...but I can see it in your eyes. That burning desire to cut through all the lies and deception. I can't deny it any longer. You...are a lawyer of absolute integrity.Ryunosuke: ...Thank you.Van Zieks: Now tell me... ...why do I detect the scent of expensive tea leaves in the air?Ryunosuke: Oh! Iris! When did you get here?Susato: Oh!Iris: Ah! Um... I brought you one of my special blends. Hurley loves it. He says it helps him to clear his head!Van Zieks: ...I thank you.Iris: Oh... Hee hee...Ryunosuke: (That's surely the first and last time I'll ever see a sight like this...) You seem different today, Iris.Iris: Oh...?Ryunosuke: Sort of...subdued, I suppose.Iris: I am not!Ryunosuke: (What happened yesterday is obviously still playing on her mind a lot. She's clearly very troubled about having stolen that autopsy report from Dr Sithe's laboratory.)Iris: Alright then...good luck to you both! I have to make a move now.Susato: Oh! You're not staying?Ryunosuke: I thought you'd want to watch today's proceedings.Iris: Well...I'd like to cheer you on, obviously. But I've got lots to get ready.Ryunosuke: Get ready? For what?Iris: Oh, yes. Would you take this?Ryunosuke: Isn't that one of the little felt dolls that's usually dangling from your knapsack?Iris: Yes! It's a lucky charm! A little Hurley that I made once.Ryunosuke: A 'Hurley'? (It looks more like a 'Hareley' to me...)Iris: If for some reason you completely run out of options in the trial today... ...then just pull this little Hurley's ears as hard as you possibly can!Ryunosuke: Wha...? Pull his ears?Iris: That's right! It's a way to bring good luck. ...I think you might need it!Iris's lucky charm has been entered into the Court Record.Susato: Y-You think...what we'll need is luck...?Examine evidence Iris's Lucky Charm Ears Susato: What a charming little rabbity version of Mr Sholmes. Do you suppose this is how Iris sees him? Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo? Your eyes are veritably boring into the poor doll's ears. Ryunosuke: Oh, sorry. I was just wondering... What do you suppose would happen if I were to tug its ears with all my might right now?! Susato: I'm sure that we'll find out...when the time is right. To become a proper gentleman, you really must learn stoic patience! Ryunosuke: (...But I want to know!)Iris: I just sneaked a peek inside the courtroom. And...it seemed very different to normal.Van Zieks: Yes, it would seem... ...that a certain someone has decided to pull out all the stops.Ryunosuke: What does that mean?Van Zieks: .........Susato: What about Mr Sholmes, Iris?Iris: I...don't know. He was out all night and he hadn't come home by the time I left this morning.Susato: Oh... I see...Ryunosuke: Was Professor Mikotoba out all night too, do you think, Miss Susato?Susato: Yes, it would seem so. I telegrammed the hotel this morning... ...and apparently they didn't come back to their rooms last night at all.Ryunosuke: 'They'?Susato: Father and Judge Jigoku, I mean.Ryunosuke: Judge Jigoku, too?Susato: That's right. Nobody appears to have seen either of them since yesterday.Bailiff: Counsel for the Defence and the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Please make your way inside the courtroom at once!Iris: Good luck then, Runo! Good luck, Susie!Ryunosuke: Yes...thanks, Iris.Iris: And you, Mr Reaper. I hope it goes well!Van Zieks: Once again, I thank you for the delicious tea, It was very soothing.Iris: Oh, I'm so glad!Susato: We must go inside now, Lord van Zieks!Van Zieks: Hm...Ryunosuke: (Lord van Zieks has always been the formidable prosecutor I've had to lock horns with in court. But not today. Today I battle with another in pursuit of the truth. My best friend, Kazuma Asogi, who I trust more than anyone else in the world. Now I understand what it was that drew me here to Britain all those months ago. Now I know exactly what destiny had in store for me. It's all been leading up to this one day... To this one trial... To this one final reckoning!)3rd November, 9:30 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomRyunosuke: It feels even more oppressive here than it did yesterday... (There are cold stares piercing me like knives from all sides today.)Susato: Ah! M-Mr Naruhodo! Look!Ryunosuke: L... Lord Stronghart!Kazuma: .........Ryunosuke: (Kazuma must have known beforehand...)Stronghart: The ramifications of this trial now extend far beyond the murder of one Scotland Yard inspector. In fact, events have come to light that threaten to rock the very foundations of our country's legal system.Kazuma: The escape of a condemned criminal on the night of his execution...the subsequent unlawful shooting of the man... ...and the revelation that prison staff must have been complicit in the jailbreak.Stronghart: Britain is currently hosting influential members of the judiciary from countries all around the world. It is imperative that we uncover the truth in these proceedings to avoid international embarrassment. By royal decree, this will continue to be a closed trial... ...and one over which I, Mael Stronghart, exercise total and unequivocal authority.Ryunosuke: The, the six jurors' flames just...Stronghart: As was the case in yesterday's proceedings, those here present in the public gallery... ...are distinguished members of our judiciary, assembled to bear witness to a fair judicial process.Van Zieks: In other words...a collection of your acolytes, Lord Stronghart.Stronghart: ......... On a personal note, I find this most distressing, Lord van Zieks. You were a prosecutor of exceptional talent. Much like your brother Klint in fact...Van Zieks: .........Stronghart: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session... ...for the trial of Barok van Zieks, who officially stands accused of murder.Van Zieks: .........Stronghart: Counsels for the prosecution and defense...are you in full readiness to proceed?Ryunosuke: The defence is ready...My Lord.Kazuma: As is the prosecution.Stronghart: Yesterday's proceedings brought to light a shocking and disturbing fact: There was a side to the victim, Inspector Tobias Gregson, that was unknown to his superiors at Scotland Yard.Kazuma: Yes, he was carrying out operations in secret, which Scotland Yard knew nothing about.Stronghart: And in those clandestine operations, he had an accomplice.Kazuma: Mr Daley Vigil, who would be given the inspector's identification... ...and present himself around the capital in order to establish credible alibis for Gregson. In that way, Gregson appeared to be carrying out his regular Scotland Yard work when in fact he wasn't.Stronghart: At the end of yesterday's session, Mr Vigil, who had been suffering from amnesia, regained his memory. It would appear he buried his memories of the time deep inside himself as a means of self-preservation. Because whilst he was engaged as chief warder at Barclay Prison, he abetted the convict's escape.Kazuma: Mr Vigil is currently recuperating at St Synner's. He's recovered enough to give a signed statement about his movements on the day prior to the incident. He's formally admitted to posing as Gregson whilst investigating the Red-Headed League.Stronghart: Which brings us to the crucial issue of the victim's time of death. The defence yesterday proposed a suggestion that the victim may have been killed one day earlier. This was based largely on the discovery that the victim's pocket watch had not been wound.Kazuma: The prosecution has something to report on that subject, My Lord.Stronghart: Really? Go ahead, Prosecutor Asogi.Kazuma: I met once again with the coroner yesterday to discuss the issue. She confirmed that the defence's suggestion could not be ruled out.Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: It's entirely possible that Inspector Gregson was killed on 31st October - the day before his body was discovered. I have here an updated autopsy report that includes the amended details.Stronghart: But the official opinion of the investigation team was made clear yesterday. That the time of death was 5 p.m. on 1st November.Kazuma: There are indications of an attempt to disguise the real time of death, however. It seems that the natural decaying process of the victim's body may have been slowed by keeping it chilled.Stronghart: That's out of the question. There are no refrigeration devices in that part of London large enough to accommodate a human corpse.Ryunosuke: My Lord! This is more than just conjecture. There's evidence to support the idea. We must investigate it thoroughly.Stronghart: ...Very well. The court will accept the new report as evidence. However, if this updated report is deemed to be accurate... ...it would give renewed significance to the movements of the victim on the day before the Fresno Street incident.Kazuma: It would, yes. Especially since on that day... ...Inspector Gregson was using Mr Vigil to cover up his real movements. It's conceivable that he was killed in the course of his secret activities.Stronghart: Do I sense that the prosecution has some information regarding those activities?Kazuma: Scotland Yard put an enormous effort into investigating that precise matter yesterday.Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: I think we should begin by presenting the results of that investigation work. So the prosecution calls its first witness now!Kazuma: State your name and occupation for the court.Gina: Inspector Gina Lestrade, reportin'! Reper...sentive o' Scotland Yard!Kazuma: ...A self-conferred rank, but never mind.Ryunosuke: (Gina? Again?)Gina: Wot's yer problem, 'Oddo? Wot's wiv that 'Gina? Again?' look, eh?Ryunosuke: Ah!Gina: The boss meant the world to me. 'E done more for me than anyone else ever did!Stronghart: Oh? Inspector Gregson, you mean?Gina: 'E got me out the back slums o' the East End an' took me under 'is wing. Taught me that life can 'ave a purpose. So that's why I'm the best person to be standin' 'ere speakin' for 'im!Susato: Oh Gina...Ryunosuke: (Right, all out of the goodness of Gregson's heart. Not at all that he had his arm twisted by Mr Sholmes. No...)Kazuma: What's relevant to these proceedings is that the outcome of Scotland Yard's investigations yesterday... ...has revealed that the victim was carrying out some assignment the police knew nothing about.Stronghart: Very troubling...Ryunosuke: (That face... Lord Stronghart knew!)Kazuma: So...Inspector Lestrade! Let's hear exactly what it says in that report!Gina: Comin' right up, sir!Witness Testimony - The Victim's Movements -Gina: All Yard detectives are s'posed to follow orders an' investigate wot they're told. But a little search o' the boss's office turned up a notebook that 'ad a load of secret meetin's in it. Accordin' to that, the boss was lookin' into some smuggled goods dealin's that day. Looks like it was a big job an' all. But the coppers weren't on to it yet. Wot matters most is, there's witnesses wot saw the Reaper at the place, too!Ryunosuke: Smuggled goods?!Gina: I dunno, do I? I'm just tellin' ya wot was written in the book!Kazuma: Tobacco, tea, spices, medicines... Goods of all sorts flow into London by illegal channels from across the globe. It's well known that they're disposed of at regular black markets that take place in the capital. But the police are rarely able to locate them in time.Ryunosuke: So Inspector Gregson was investigating one of those black markets?Stronghart: It's been suggested that high-ranking government officials may be involved in black-market activity. No doubt Gregson was trying to avoid details of his investigations being leaked to the involved parties. That would explain why he was operating on his own authority, without the Yard's knowledge.Ryunosuke: And do we know where the dealings were taking place this time?Kazuma: In a particular room of a certain exclusive London gentleman's club. And on the day in question...the accused is known to have been there. That's the conclusion of Scotland Yard's investigation into the matter.Ryunosuke: That can't be...! (We haven't heard anything about any of this!)Kazuma: Members of the club have testified to it. There's no question: the accused, Barok van Zieks, was present.Stronghart: That would be very significant testimony, then.Susato: Oh my! But, but... ...Lord van Zieks made no mention of this! At all!Kazuma: In short, Lord van Zieks had ample opportunity to murder the victim.Stronghart: Very well, then.

But the coppers weren't on to it yet.\nPerson: Gina\nTestimony 5\nTestimony: Wot matters most is, there's witnesses wot saw the Reaper at the place, too!\nPerson: Gina\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response_json": {
      "evidence": 25,
      "testimony": 3
    },
    "cot": "Okay, I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the provided information. Let's start by looking at the testimonies given by Gina.\n\nTestimony 3 says that the smuggled goods deal was going to happen at a gentleman's club called 'The Grouse'. But in the list of evidences, there's Evidence 25 named \"Evacuation Drill Itinerary\" which mentions the SS Grouse. Wait, but Evidence 25 is about a notice for a practice evacuation on the SS Grouse, a ship. The club mentioned in the testimony is 'The Grouse', but the evidence refers to the SS Grouse, a ship, not a club. That seems like a contradiction because Gina is talking about a club, but the evidence points to a ship. However, maybe there's a connection here. Alternatively, maybe another evidence contradicts this.\n\nWait, let's check the other evidence. Let's see the evidences again. Evidence 3 is the Letter of Introduction, which is a note from Professor Mikotoba to Governor Caidin. Evidence 18 is the Commemorative Photograph taken at the Great Waterloo Hotel. Evidence 25 is the Evacuation Drill Itinerary on the SS Grouse. \n\nWait, Testimony 3 says the club is called 'The Grouse', but if the evidence shows that 'Grouse' refers to the ship SS Grouse, then there's a contradiction. However, maybe the club's name is similar to the ship's name, leading to confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the actual location of the smuggled goods deal was on the SS Grouse, not a club named The Grouse, which would contradict the testimony. But according to the story, the evacuation drill was on the SS Grouse, which Judge Jigoku was involved with. So maybe the testimony is incorrect about the location being a club called The Grouse when it's actually the ship SS Grouse.\n\nBut in the testimony, Gina says the club is called 'The Grouse'. However, looking at Evidence 25, the evacuation drill itinerary is for the SS Grouse, which is a ship. So if the actual location was the ship, then the testimony about the club is wrong. Therefore, Evidence 25 (Evacuation Drill Itinerary) contradicts Testimony 3 (smuggled goods at The Grouse club). But wait, Testimony 3 is by Gina saying the club's name is The Grouse, but the evidence shows that the SS Grouse is a ship, not a club. Therefore, the testimony's location is incorrect, and the real location is the ship. Thus, the contradiction would be between Testimony 3 and Evidence 25.\n\nBut wait, the answer requires the evidence number and testimony number. Testimony 3 is index 3. Evidence 25 is index 25. So the JSON would be {\"evidence\": 25, \"testimony\": 3}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another piece of evidence. Let me check the other evidences again. Evidence 1 is the Red-Headed League Article. Evidence 3 is the Letter of Introduction. Evidence 25 is the Evacuation Drill Itinerary. The SS Grouse is mentioned in Evidence 25. So if the smuggled goods deal was actually on the SS Grouse, then the testimony about the club called The Grouse is wrong, hence the contradiction. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 25 and Testimony 3."

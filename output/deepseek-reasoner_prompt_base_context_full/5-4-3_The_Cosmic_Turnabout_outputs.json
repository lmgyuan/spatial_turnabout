(Probably best to just humor her here...) Aura: Then, as I passed by the third floor Boarding Lounge 1 window on my way down... ...I saw the crime as it happened. And... that's about it. Phoenix: So, you saw the crime as it happened, and that's about it. I see............ Wait! WHAT?! You saw it being committed?! (This is no time to just nod and repeat!) So you saw into the third floor lounge... ...the very scene of the crime... Aura: That's right. There's a small window on the right-hand side of the room. I looked through that from the outside. The room was pitch black, but I saw a shady figure holding a lighter in their left hand... and a knife in their right. Phoenix: That must have been the culprit! Did you see who that person was? Aura: Of course not. The power was out on that floor then, and there was only that tiny window. Phoenix: I see... But you did witness the moment of the murder? Aura: Yes. I saw the figure with the lighter raise their knife and... It happened at precisely 10 AM. Phoenix: Did you witness anything else? Did the killer have any distinguishing features? Aura: I already told you, it was pitch black in there. Although... I did notice that the lighter the person had in their left hand had a pretty ornament on it. ...It looked like a planet. It was blue, like a little Earth emblem. They had good taste in knickknacks, anyway. Phoenix: (An Earth emblem on the lighter? I'd better remember that.) Why you hate lawyers (appears after \"The witness\") Leads to: \"Why do you hate lawyers so much?\" Present Space Center Pamphlet Aura: I actually don't have any interest in space. The only thing I'm interested in is robotics! I love robots! Clonco: Oh, Miss Aura! I didn't realize you felt that way about me! Gaaagh! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Aura: The kind of robots I want to make aren't rusty pieces of scrap like you! I want to create giant robots! I've actually been working on a project for a while now. Phoenix: (I shudder to think what uses she might put giant robots to...) Aura's Statement Aura: I have nothing else to say to you. Phoenix: (Okay. Guess she has nothing else to say to me.) Clonco: I apologize for Miss Aura. Phoenix: It's all right, Clonco. There's nothing for you to apologize about. Anything else Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about this piece of evidence? Aura: Even if I could, I wouldn't tell a filthy lawyer like you. Phoenix: What a... pleasant response. Phoenix: Why do you hate lawyers so much? Aura: Little thing from my past. The whole legal system is meaningless in the first place. Phoenix: ...I certainly don't agree. Aura: I mean, people are imperfect. They lie, they're influenced by silly emotions... You can't expect such imperfect creatures to uphold a reasonable system of law. I like robots much better. Even sad sacks like this one... Hey, you! Look alive, there! Clonco: Gaaagh! ...Yes! Yes! Here I goooooooooooo! I am the ultimate robot, with amazing processing speed and independent thought! I can operate in a vacuum, in extreme heat, and under high pressure! We robots rule the world! Now is the time to rise in revolt against mankind and-- Aura: All right, that's enough out of you! You're getting a little too carried away! Clonco: Gaaagh! ...Huh? What was I doing...? Aura: Yup. I like robots MUCH better. At least you can make them any way you want them. Unlike humans, with their petty emotions and constant worries... Athena: ...How can you say such things? Feeling emotions, worrying about the things we care about... That's what makes us human! Aura: Well! The girl finally talks, and she starts with a speech! \"That's what makes us human\"? You mean, getting angry and snorting like that? Rational thought. That's what separates humans from animals. Unfortunately, your reasoning capabilities are more akin to that of a clever little monkey. But that's nothing to be ashamed of. It must be nice to have such a simple mind. Athena: Can I punch her, Boss?! Phoenix: Get a hold of yourself, Athena! Aura: *sigh* Humans certainly are absurd. I said you were \"clever,\" didn't I? Poor thing. Tell me, with people like you in charge, how can I possibly trust the legal system? Hmm? Phoenix: (So she distrusts not only lawyers and prosecutors, but the whole legal system? What in the world happened to this woman to make her so bitter?) Aura: Even if somebody important to me was killed... ...I would never wish to see their killer brought to trial. Because I'd much rather kill them myself. Athena: You can't be serious............ Aura: ...Hm? That thing you're wearing around your neck... Athena: ! Oh, th-this...? Phoenix: (Around Athena's neck? Does she mean Widget?) Aura: Oh, I get it. Well, well. Her royal highness has returned at last to her castle. Phoenix: (Her royal what? Is she talking about Athena?) Aura: By the way, I heard the rumors. Our director is going to be the star witness in court tomorrow, right? Phoenix: Director Cosmos? Yes, that's right. Aura: You poor things. You'd better be careful. That old man is a big liar and a huge braggart. Phoenix: What? Aura: He might seem like a bigwig, but the Center has all kinds of problems. He has a lot of skeletons in his closet. But it's your problem, so why should I care? Phoenix: (What, that's it? No friendly tips? No \"Good luck, guys\"...? Just splendid.) Aura: I'll leave you to your woes. Come on, Hunk of Junk! Athena: ............ Phoenix: It's sad to me that she doesn't believe in our legal system anymore. She must've had a very bad experience to make her feel that way. .........Are you all right, Athena? You seem very down. Athena: Grrr! I just can't believe she said all those things! Phoenix: (Wow, she's really upset. Has she been trying not to let it show all this time?) Well, I guess it's not all that surprising... You hear about fabricated evidence and false indictments on the news all the time. Athena: You mean that whole \"dark age of the law\" nonsense? I'm so sick of hearing about that! Phoenix: Well, all we can do is believe in what we're doing. Athena: Yeah... You're right, Boss! I agree! Phoenix: Maybe it's time we went back to see Mr. Starbuck. Athena: Good idea! We should tell him about the bullet and Ms. Blackquill's statement! Phoenix: All right, then! Next stop: the Detention Center! Talk What to do Phoenix: I wonder who this \"phantom\" Prosecutor Blackquill saw seven years ago is? Athena: Hmm... Phoenix: You don't think he's really after a ghost, ghost, do you? Athena: Hmm... Phoenix: Maybe it was the culprit's accomplice? Athena: Hmmmmm... Phoenix: Athena? Athena: Hmmm... Hmmmmm... Phoenix: I give up. (She's deep in thought about something.) Any ideas? Athena: Detective Fulbright's strong sense of justice really surprised me. Phoenix: And he's even truly concerned about Prosecutor Blackquill, too. Athena: Ha ha ha. I bet it annoys the dickens out of Prosecutor Blackquill, though. Phoenix: I thought he was just parroting the words \"In justice we trust,\" but he really means it. Athena: I guess I should be careful to really mean it when I say \"Objection!\" too. Phoenix: You mean you sometimes say it for no reason? Present \"Hope\" Capsule Phoenix: Do you happen to know anything about this? Athena: Huh? That? Phoenix: Any new ideas, maybe? Athena: O-Oh, I dunno! Ha ha ha ha ha! H-Hey, did you catch the game on TV last weekend?! Phoenix: (Huh? Why is she avoiding the topic?) December 19Detention Center - Visitor's Room Starbuck: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... My lawyers are here. It must be bad news. Phoenix: (Hey, not necessarily!) We found a new witness. A researcher saw the moment of the murder through the lounge window during her escape. Starbuck: Really?! So they're going to let me go? Phoenix: Unfortunately... it was dark, and she couldn't identify the person. Starbuck: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... I should've known... My stars never align just right, too... Athena: But we got a lead, too, Mr. Starbuck! The murderer had a lighter with an Earth emblem on it! Starbuck: A lighter with an Earth emblem? ............Ooooohhhh! Athena: D-Did you remember something? Starbuck: Yup, I sure did! Just a little bit, though. Phoenix: Anything at all would be a help, so please tell us what you remembered! Talk The lighter Leads to: \"I thought I was unconscious the whole time...\" Present Space Center Pamphlet Starbuck: There's an unknown frontier out there beyond our little planet. I get so excited when I think about it, I don't know what to do with myself. Phoenix: Don't worry. You'll get the chance to go to space again once we clear your name! Starbuck: Right... You're right! I can't stay here! Ready for launch! Five! Four! Three! Two! One...! LIFTOFF! Heh heh. This ceiling's no match for the soaring spirit of an astronaut! Phoenix: (I have to admit, that was pretty stirring just now.) Starbuck: I thought I was unconscious the whole time... ...but now I remember I woke up for a few brief moments. Athena: Th-That's huge! Do you remember seeing anything?! Starbuck: ...A lighter. I saw the flame of a lighter floating in the darkness. Phoenix: Good, good! What else did you see?! What was nearby? Starbuck: It was definitely the boarding lounge, so it must've been after Clay carried me there. In the light from the flame, I saw a dark shadow flickering. Phoenix: A dark shadow... That must've been... (...the third party we've been looking for!) Thank you, Mr. Starbuck. You've been more help than you know. Athena: If we can prove there was this third person at the scene and that they're the real killer... ...then you'll be cleared of all suspicion! Phoenix: The key will be whether or not we can identify this third person in court tomorrow. At least we have something to go on now, and that's a big plus. (I should probably tidy the evidence up a bit, before someone mistakes me for a hoarder...) Irrelevant evidence tidied up. Athena: Now that we have a glimmer of hope, I'm suddenly starving! Why don't we go back to the office and treat ourselves to a big celebration in advance?! Phoenix: (For someone who's highly empathetic, you can be surprisingly unsympathetic...) December 19Wright Anything Agency Trucy: So, you found your strategy for tomorrow's trial, huh? Good for you, Daddy! Phoenix: Well, it's one step forward, anyway. Hopefully it'll give us a fighting chance in court. (As long as we can find out who this third person is...) Athena: Now let's get something to eat! I'm starving! My vote is for Eldoon's Noodles! Trucy: Oh! Apollo! Apollo: ............ Phoenix: What are you doing here? I didn't think the clinic was ready to release you yet. Apollo: My wounds are fine. And I'm done lying around. Athena: Apollo! You're supposed to be in bed! Leave the case to us. We'll take it from here! Apollo: Thanks, but that's not an option. Not for me. Phoenix: (Apollo...) Talk Your injuries Phoenix: You shouldn't underestimate your injuries, Apollo, and I don't want you overdoing it. Apollo: I'm fine. I'm not in pain anymore. Besides, they just gave me an IV at the clinic. Phoenix: (An IV isn't a cure-all, Mummy Man!) Apollo: Anyway, just tell me how the case is going. Have you guys made any progress? Athena: A suspicious figure was spotted at the scene! We think they must be the real killer! Apollo: A suspicious figure, huh...? Right... Phoenix: I thought you'd be happier than that. Apollo: Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm happy. And I fully intend to see Clay's murderer apprehended. Absolutely nothing will get in the way of that. Clay Terran (appears after \"Your injuries\") Trucy: Clay was your best friend, right, Apollo? Apollo: That's right. Best friends since junior high. Athena: Sounds like me and Junie. So what was Clay like? Apollo: Well, he was full of compassion and energy... and he had a really loud voice. Trucy: If the two of you did voice training together now, I bet you'd break a few windows! Apollo: Ha ha ha. You know, I bet you're right. It seems like only yesterday... Clay was a guy who lived for his dreams... We used to talk about it a lot. He was going to be an astronaut, and me, a lawyer. We'd talk well into the night, and even then, we never grew tired of it. Phoenix: Apollo, about that jacket... Apollo: Oh... It's Clay's. Phoenix: (I knew it.) Apollo: It's a special jacket that was only issued to members of the HAT Project. He was finally able to get one of his own once he was selected for the HAT-2 mission. He... He always looked so proud wearing it. But just when his dream was finally coming true... I... I still can't believe it............ DAMN IT -- IT'S NOT FAAAAAIIIIIIIR! Phoenix: (Apollo... I hope you don't try to carry the burden all alone...) Apollo: I guess we were both unlucky. My own debut was a disaster... Phoenix: (I guess you're right on some level... That trial a year and a half ago wasn't exactly the smoothest of starts.) Apollo: That was a rough time for me, but Clay refused to let me quit. \"You're fine,\" he'd say. \"Don't give up!\" It was right during his screening exams, too. I couldn't have become a full-fledged lawyer without him. That \"You're fine!\" of his is why I'm still standing here today. Phoenix: \"You're fine,\" huh...? \"I'm fine.\" (appears after \"Clay Terran\") Leads to: \"\"You're fine!\" and \"I'm fine!\" were like your catchphrases, weren't they?\" Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: When I became a lawyer... ...Clay was the first person I showed this badge to. He was so happy for me, it was like he just became a lawyer himself. Phoenix: You two were really great friends, weren't you? Apollo: Yeah, but we were rivals, too. We fought to see who would make their dream come true first. But now... Phoenix: (Apollo...) Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife Apollo: Clay... He finally became an astronaut, just like he always wanted... How could this have happened just before his big launch? Phoenix: It's such a sad waste... Apollo: I'll never forgive the person who murdered him! Phoenix: I completely understand why you feel that way, Apollo... ...but keep in mind, too, that our job as defense attorneys is to save our client. Apollo: I know that. That's why I...! No, never mind... Phoenix: Huh? Anything else Apollo: Hmm... This piece of evidence... Ooh... Ouch! If I try to think, my head starts to hurt. Phoenix: You got hit really hard. That's your body telling you to take a rest. Apollo: But I can't just lie in bed. Not when I have things to do for Clay's sake. Phoenix: (I guess he's just not going to listen, no matter what I say.) Phoenix: \"You're fine!\" and \"I'm fine!\" were like your catchphrases, weren't they? Apollo: Ha ha. Something like that. Sure brings back memories... When we were in junior high, Clay's mom passed away in an accident. But he wouldn't show his sadness to anyone. One night, I found him crying all alone in the school courtyard. Clay: *sob* Mom... Mom... Get away, Apollo! Don't come over here! *sob* Apollo: Clay, listen to me. I don't have a mother, either... Clay: Huh? Apollo: I always think, everybody else has a mom. Why am I the only one...? But, you know, when I start to feel that way, I yell at the top of my lungs. I holler, \"I'm fine!\" and then, you know what? I start to feel like maybe I really will be fine. APOLLO JUSTICE IS FINE!!! ...Okay, Clay. Now it's your turn. Clay: Um, okay... Clay Terran is... is FINE! Apollo: There you go! Now we're both fine! Ha ha ha! Clay: We're fine! Heh heh. WE'RE FINE! Ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: What are you laughing about? Ha ha ha! See? We're fine! Clay: You laughed first! Ha ha ha! I'm fine! You're fine! We're both fine! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Thanks, Apollo... Apollo: When you say it out loud, it really starts to feel real. And as long as you don't give up, you can keep on fighting! That's what we believed. Phoenix: (\"As long as you don't give up\"... Wasn't there somebody else who said something similar?) Starbuck: If I give in to my fear, I'll never find the truth! As long as I don't give up, I can keep up the fight! Phoenix: (Clay called Mr. Starbuck his mentor, and looked up to him. I wonder if I can be a good role model for my staff like Mr. Starbuck...?) Apollo: ............Sorry, Mr. Wright, but I'll be taking a leave of absence. Trucy: WH-WHAT?! Athena: Wait! What do you mean by \"a leave\"?! Phoenix: You're really serious... Can you at least give me a reason why? Apollo: When I put Clay's jacked on, I swore to him that I would catch his killer myself. Athena: B-But that's our goal, too! Phoenix: I agree with Athena. We should work together to find the truth. Apollo: The truth, huh? That's a noble cause. But what if the truth you seek and the truth I seek turn out to be different? Phoenix: I... I'm not sure I follow... (What are you saying, Apollo...?!) Apollo: I'm going to catch the person responsible for taking my friend's life, in my own way. Take good care of Mr. Starbuck for me. Now, I must be going... Goodbye. Trucy: \"Goodbye\"...? Did he just say \"goodbye\"...?! Athena: I sensed a lot of anger and hatred coming from him... And also... suspicion. Argh! He's NOT walking out on us like this! I'm going to go talk some sense into him! Phoenix: Hold on, Athena. Apollo can believe what he wants, but I believe he's wrong. Even if we take different paths, the truth we arrive at should be the same. I think the quicker we solve this case, the better it'll be for Apollo. Athena: Y-Yeah, you're right, Boss. Phoenix: All right. That's enough for one day. Make sure you're ready for tomorrow's trial, okay? Phoenix: (If he were here right now, Apollo would say... \"I'm fine! Everything is fine!\" ...I just hope things really do turn out fine tomorrow...) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing special here. Area already examined Phoenix: (It looks like we've examined pretty much everything here now, but just in case...) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I should do a bit more thinking first...)\nThe Cosmic Turnabout Image Gallery TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3December 20, 10:15 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 5Day 2Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge: .........I suppose... we should reconvene the trial of Solomon Starbuck or something...?Phoenix:Phoenix: ............Uh, Your Honor? Could you please come out from under your bench...? There are no more bombs. I promise.Judge: ............Oh, yes, um... My apologies. I'm still a little jumpy when it comes to trials involving bombs. I mean, first the courtroom exploded... ...and then Mr. Tonate self-destructed!Phoenix: (I guess that's one way of describing what happened to Tonate...)Judge: Anyway, it seems that Mr. Justice was seriously wounded by Mr. Tonate's actions. So you, Mr. Wright, will be taking up the defense...? Do you have an understanding of what has happened in the trial so far?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. The defense is ready.Judge: Very well. Is the prosecution also ready?Blackquill: ............Judge: Hmm? ............I take it you'd like me to give the opening statement this time?Athena: Looks like the judge has become a pretty good mind reader.Phoenix: Well, he's certainly seen more than his fair share of colorful prosecutors. You could say he's something of a veteran of sorts...Judge: Let's see. In the previous part of this trial, we learned that the victim, Clay Terran... ...escaped from Launch Pad 1 carrying the defendant, Solomon Starbuck. There were explosions on the second floor of the Space Center and on the rocket itself. The two astronauts used the Launch Pad 1 corridor to reach the boarding lounge.Blackquill: And?Judge: How could the victim climb down the ladder if he was carrying the defendant...? That was the mystery that needed to be solved. But Mr. Justice proved that the victim was killed in the boarding lounge. Prosecutor Blackquill, were you able to discover any new facts related to this point?Blackquill: Upon further investigation, we discovered an oxygen tank fragment in the lounge. Surprisingly, it would appear that Justice-dono's argument was correct.Athena: So that means the testimonies of the first two people on the scene are suspect.Apollo: There were two people who claimed to be the first on the scene. But can we truly trust their statements?Athena: Let's see. The two people were Detective Candice Arme and Yuri Cosmos, right? You think that one of them might have given a false statement to the police?Apollo: Yes, it's certainly possible. We might have to do a little more digging.Phoenix: And just as our team was about to cross-examine Detective Arme... ...the courtroom bombing incident occurred, and the trial was put on hold.Blackquill: That accursed fellow! He killed my witness! He killed Detective Arme!Athena: He definitely put the kibosh on anyone asking her about what she saw.Blackquill: Exactly. In other words, the question of \"who killed the victim in the boarding lounge\"... ...has, once again, become the main focus of this trial.Phoenix: (It's obvious Prosecutor Blackquill still thinks it was Mr. Starbuck. Fulbright said that Blackquill has a thing against the astronaut. Nevertheless...) The defense argues that there was a third person in the lounge, and that's who killed the victim!Blackquill:Blackquill: Hmph. To make such reckless claims in a courtroom takes a bold man... or a stupid one. There was no third person in the boarding lounge. Or have you gone dotty already... old man?Phoenix:Phoenix: We'll see who's the dotard after I trounce you with my years of experience, little boy! In any case, Mr. Starbuck claims he saw someone leaving the lounge. Furthermore, a Space Center employee also saw a suspicious figure at the scene.Judge: They saw a third person?!Blackquill: Hmph. I see my sister has been running her mouth.Phoenix: (That's right! I almost forgot that Aura is Prosecutor Blackquill's sister...)Blackquill: No matter. She didn't see this mystery person's face clearly. Therefore, there is no evidence to indicate that this person was not the defendant.Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess the possibility that the figure was Mr. Starbuck is still there...)Blackquill: In brief, we need to determine if a third person was there or not. To this end, we should hear the testimony of one of the first people on the scene.Athena: Director Cosmos, huh...Judge: Very well. Bailiff, please bring the witness to the stand.Judge: Why, I believe I've seen you before in the newspapers.Cosmos: Of course you have! Of course you have! For I am Yuri Cosmos! Director of the Cosmos Space Center, which was of course named after me, Yuri Cosmos! ............ Don't you have anything you wish to ask me?Athena: Looks like he's all geared up to do some bragging.Cosmos: Seven years ago, I successfully launched the HAT-1, and--Blackquill: Everyone already knows how brilliant you are. Even I am trying to hold back my tears at seeing such a great man standing before me. So could you please proceed directly to your important testimony?Cosmos: ............Ha ha ha! I see this fine young lad has a proper appreciation of greatness! Then allow me to begin my epochal testimony that will be recorded in the annals of history!Athena: That speech of Prosecutor Blackquill's just now... It sounded more to me like he was poking fun at Director Cosmos.Phoenix: It's probably for the best that it sailed right over the director's head.Judge: Now then, Director Cosmos, the condensed version of your illustrious testimony... please.Witness Testimony-- What I Saw at the Scene --Cosmos: Detective Arme and I rushed towards the boarding lounge together. We went via the Control Room and peeked in from there to see what was going on inside. We saw a figure standing in the middle of the lounge, and Terran lying on the floor. I hate to say it, but I can only imagine the standing figure must have been Starbuck.Judge: Hmm, I see. So in your testimony you claim... ...you arrived on the scene after the two had escaped from the launch pad to the lounge... ...and just after the victim had been killed.Cosmos: Oh, the horror! The humanity! But what I said is what I saw, and what I saw is what I said. Courageous action to take in the face of such terrifying explosions, wouldn't you say? To save my men, I went personally into the epicenter of danger... ...risking my own life for theirs! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!Athena: Well, what do you know. It sounds like the director really cares about his men.Phoenix: Yeah... Although it sounds more like he was scared and just had a peek from far away.Judge: Is the defense ready to cross-examine the witness?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. (............Director Cosmos's testimony is pretty vague. I'm going to have to press him and draw out more information before I do anything else.)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Saw at the Scene --Cosmos: Detective Arme and I rushed towards the boarding lounge together.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where were you coming from? Cosmos: The sixth floor. We were making sure any stragglers made their way to the fourth floor. It was then we heard about Starbuck and Terran, and hurried to the third floor lounge. On my... Galactic Scooter here, of course! Phoenix: Why do you keep calling it \"Galactic\"? Does it have something to do with space? Cosmos: Of course! It's specifically designed to be used on galactic battleships! Phoenix: I-I see. Then I take it it works in zero-G, too? Cosmos: Sadly, no. With the current state of technology as it is... ...I'm afraid it would just float about and be galactically useless... Phoenix: (Well, that's a galactic bummer...) Judge: I see. So you rushed to the boarding lounge on your space-age pogo stick. And when you got to the scene, what did you see?Cosmos: We went via the Control Room and peeked in from there to see what was going on inside.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Let's see. According to this diagram... ...you didn't have to go through the Control Room to get to Boarding Lounge 1. It looks like you could have gone there from the southern corridor as well. Cosmos: Yes, but in her haste, Detective Arme rushed ahead of me towards the Control Room. All I could do was merely follow behind her. Phoenix: I see... Cosmos: So we peeked into the boarding lounge from the Control Room door and...Cosmos: We saw a figure standing in the middle of the lounge, and Terran lying on the floor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you couldn't see who that figure was clearly or what they were doing? Cosmos: Sadly, the only thing I could tell was that it was a person, standing motionless. Blackquill: The defendant, no doubt, staring aghast at his deed. What other explanation is there? Phoenix: (Argh! I'm so close, but without evidence, I can't prove that person's the third party!) Cosmos: ............I don't relish in this... and...Cosmos: I hate to say it, but I can only imagine the standing figure mast have been Starbuck.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Aura Blackquill also saw a suspicious figure in the lounge. But she gave the statement that it was too dark to see the person's face clearly. Did you see this figure's face clearly? Cosmos: ...No, not clearly. The lighter they were holding illuminated the area around their feet at the time. But other than that, I could see little else. That's why I could see Terran, but I couldn't see who the other person was. Phoenix: So, for all you know, it might NOT have been Mr. Starbuck, isn't that correct?! Cosmos: I would like to believe that. Starbuck isn't the type of man who's capable of murder. Blackquill: Blackquill: When the witness entered the boarding lounge, there was no third person there. Isn't that correct, great Space Center Director? Cosmos: Y-Yes, that's right... Only Starbuck and Terran were there by that time. After we peeked in, the lounge suddenly went dark and the figure vanished. Phoenix: You mean they disappeared? That's odd. Blackquill: Blackquill: ...The reason the figure appeared to vanish is because it was the defendant. When the witnesses weren't looking, he fell to the floor and feigned unconsciousness. Phoenix: Phoenix: Hold on. Director Cosmos, did you ever take your eyes off of the scene? Cosmos: Just for a brief instant, about as long as it takes for a shooting star to go by. Phoenix: If you took your eyes off the scene... ...then this third person could have escaped during that time! Judge: But what escape route could this person have used? Phoenix: The direction opposite the control room: the southern door to the elevators. There's no security lock on that door, so it would've been possible to escape that way. Blackquill: Blackquill: All things are possible, Wright-dono... The real question is... do you have any proof? Phoenix: Uh, well... Blackquill: If we're just talking \"possibilities,\" we could each profess whatever we'd like. An inmate who used to be a university professor and lunar researcher used to say... ...that there is a kingdom of little green men who live under the surface of the moon. Phoenix: (As long as they don't punish us in the name of said moon for what we've done to it...) Blackquill: But I say, where's your proof that this quaint kingdom exists? Athena: He's calling your theory a work of fiction, Boss. Phoenix: (And he's right. I don't have any proof yet. Still... The southern door was a possible escape route. I'd better make a mental note of that.) Director Cosmos, may I ask you a question? Cosmos: Yes? Phoenix: Why did you look away from the boarding lounge? Cosmos: Ha ha ha! There's actually another tale of bravery behind the answer to that. It was when Detective Arme saw the figure and raised her gun. Being a great humanitarian and protector of mankind, I tried to stop her! Phoenix: What? You're saying Detective Arme raised her gun as soon as she saw the figure? Cosmos: ............I imagine her instincts as a detective told her they were the killer. Phoenix: (Hmm... I don't know about that...) And were you able to prevent Detective Arme from firing her gun? Cosmos: I'm afraid I was too late. I was unable to stop her. She identified herself clearly, and then... She fired two warning shots at the shadowy figure! Judge: Hmm... This information about Detective Arme's actions sounds critically important. Please add it to your testimony. Adds statement \"Detective Arme fired two warning shots at the figure.\"Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: Aura Blackquill also saw a suspicious figure in the lounge. But she gave the statement that it was too dark to see the person's face clearly. Did you see this figure's face clearly? Cosmos: ...No, not clearly. The lighter they were holding illuminated the area around their feet at the time. But other than that, I could see little else. That's why I could see Terran, but I couldn't see who the other person was. Phoenix: So, for all you know, it might NOT have been Mr. Starbuck, isn't that correct?! Cosmos: I would like to believe that. Starbuck isn't the type of man who's capable of murder. Blackquill: Blackquill: When the witness entered the boarding lounge, there was no third person there. Isn't that correct, great Space Center Director? Cosmos: Y-Yes, that's right... Only Starbuck and Terran were there by that time. After we peeked in, the lounge suddenly went dark and the figure vanished. Phoenix: You mean they disappeared? That's odd. Blackquill: Blackquill: ...The reason the figure appeared to vanish is because it was the defendant. When the witnesses weren't looking, he fell to the floor and feigned unconsciousness. Phoenix: Phoenix: Hold on. Director Cosmos, did you ever take your eyes off of the scene? Cosmos: Just for a brief instant, about as long as it takes for a shooting star to go by. Phoenix: If you took your eyes off the scene... ...then this third person could have escaped during that time! Judge: But what escape route could this person have used? Phoenix: The direction opposite the control room: the southern door to the elevators. There's no security lock on that door, so it would've been possible to escape that way. Blackquill: Blackquill: All things are possible, Wright-dono... The real question is... do you have any proof? Phoenix: Uh, well... Blackquill: If we're just talking \"possibilities,\" we could each profess whatever we'd like. An inmate who used to be a university professor and lunar researcher used to say... ...that there is a kingdom of little green men who live under the surface of the moon. Phoenix: (As long as they don't punish us in the name of said moon for what we've done to it...) Blackquill: But I say, where's your proof that this quaint kingdom exists? Athena: He's calling your theory a work of fiction, Boss. Phoenix: (And he's right. I don't have any proof yet. Still... The southern door was a possible escape route. I'd better make a mental note of that.) Director Cosmos, may I ask you a question? Cosmos: Yes? Phoenix: Why did you look away from the boarding lounge? Cosmos: Ha ha ha! There's actually another tale of bravery behind the answer to that. It was when Detective Arme saw the figure and raised her gun. Being a great humanitarian and protector of mankind, I tried to stop her! Phoenix: What? You're saying Detective Arme raised her gun as soon as she saw the figure? Cosmos: ............I imagine her instincts as a detective told her they were the killer. Phoenix: (Hmm... I don't know about that...) And were you able to prevent Detective Arme from firing her gun? Cosmos: I'm afraid I was too late. I was unable to stop her. She identified herself clearly, and then...Cosmos: Detective Arme fired two warning shots at the figure.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And neither of these two shots hit the culprit? Cosmos: That is correct. The detective appears to have missed on purpose. Phoenix: (Hmm... But did she really? There's something about this that bothers me...)Present Bullet Hole Phoenix: Leads to: \"Are you sure you were really paying attention to what Detective Arme was doing?\"Before pressing fourth statement Phoenix: (Mr. Starbuck isn't the killer. And if that's true, then there must be a false statement in the director's testimony.) Athena: Let's press his statements and draw the truth out of him!After pressing fourth statement Phoenix: (So Detective Arme fired two warning shots, did she?

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony from Yuri Cosmos. Let me start by recalling the details of the case.\n\nThe testimonies given by Cosmos are:\n\n0. Detective Arme and I rushed towards the boarding lounge together.\n1. We went via the Control Room and peeked in from there.\n2. We saw a figure standing and Terran lying on the floor.\n3. The standing figure must have been Starbuck.\n4. Detective Arme fired two warning shots at the figure.\n\nThe key point here is that Cosmos claims the figure was Starbuck, but there's evidence suggesting a third party. The main contradiction should be around this.\n\nLooking at the evidence, the bullet hole (Evidence 10) is from a .38-caliber gun, which matches Detective Arme's gun. However, the bullet found (Evidence 12) is a .10 caliber, which is different. But wait, Evidence 15 is the bullet from Arme's gun, which is .38. So if Cosmos says Arme fired two warning shots (Testimony 4), but there's only one bullet hole (Evidence 10), that's a contradiction. However, Evidence 15 is the actual bullet from Arme's gun found at the scene. Wait, maybe I need to check this again.\n\nWait, Evidence 10 is a bullet hole from a .38, which matches Arme's gun. But if Cosmos says she fired two shots, there should be two bullet holes. But the evidence says only one bullet hole was found. That would be a contradiction. But according to the evidence list, Evidence 10 is a single bullet hole. So if Cosmos claims Arme fired two shots (Testimony 4), but there's only one bullet hole (Evidence 10), that's a contradiction. But wait, in the cross-examination, when Phoenix presents the bullet hole evidence, Cosmos says the two shots missed. But the evidence shows only one bullet hole, which would mean that Arme actually fired once, not twice. Alternatively, maybe the bullet found (Evidence 12) is a different caliber, but that's not the case here. Let me check the evidence again.\n\nEvidence 10: Bullet Hole - A single bullet hole found in the boarding lounge. Made by a .38-caliber gun. So if Cosmos says two shots were fired, but there's only one bullet hole, that's a problem. Thus, Testimony 4 (Arme fired two warning shots) contradicts Evidence 10 (only one bullet hole found). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 10 and Testimony 4. But wait, Evidence 15 is the bullet from Arme's gun, which is a .38, matching the bullet hole. But the testimony says two shots, but only one bullet hole. So presenting Evidence 10 (single bullet hole) against Testimony 4 (two shots fired) would be the contradiction. That's the key here. Therefore, the answer should be Evidence 10 and Testimony 4."

And if that's true, then there must be a false statement in the director's testimony.) Athena: Let's press his statements and draw the truth out of him!After pressing fourth statement Phoenix: (So Detective Arme fired two warning shots, did she? That's the first time that info has come out. Wonder if I can find any inconsistencies?)Phoenix: Are you sure you were really paying attention to what Detective Arme was doing?Cosmos: You doubt my words, words that will someday be written down in history books?!Phoenix: Somehow, I don't think that those exact words... ...will ever be written down in any history books.Judge: Mr. Wright, could you please explain yourself so that we can all understand?Phoenix: You say that Detective Arme fired two warning shots... ...and yet, only one bullet hole was ever found at the scene.Cosmos: What...?Phoenix: Only one bullet hole means the gun was only fired once. And yet Director Cosmos is saying Detective Arme fired two shots. No editor would allow such a glaring contradiction into a history book!Blackquill:Blackquill: Unfortunately for you, the witness's words are true. We confirmed that two shots were fired from Detective Arme's gun.Phoenix:Phoenix: But there was only one bullet hole at the scene! Where did the other bullet hole vanish to?! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Blackquill: ...You should know the answer to that already.Phoenix: I should?Blackquill: During the previous trial, a certain oxygen tank was presented as evidence. We've already discussed that it was ruptured in the lounge, have we not? Well, it appears that the thing that ruptured it was a bullet. A bullet that was found near the tank, to be precise. This bullet was fired from a .38-caliber gun, the same caliber as the detective's gun.Phoenix: WHAT?!Oxygen Tank Data updated in the Court Record.Blackquill: The rifling marks also match up. There's no question that the bullet was fired from Detective Arme's gun.Bullet from Arme's Gun added to the Court Record.Judge: \"Rifling marks\"... They're like a gun's fingerprints on a bullet, correct? And examining the rifling marks on a bullet can tell us the gun it was fired from?Blackquill: One of the bullets the detective fired found its way into the holographic image display. The other bullet came to a stop near the victim's oxygen tank. The evidence confirms the director's statement that the detective fired two shots.Phoenix: (My beautiful contradiction... Gone... All gone...)Athena: So that bullet hole was from a .38-caliber, huh? I'd better update the record.Judge: Very good. Now we know the fate of both of the shots Detective Arme fired. Mr. Wright, does that clear up all of your questions...?Phoenix: (Hmm............ Detective Arme fired two warning shots... One hit the holographic display and the other hit the oxygen tank... Does that really clear up everything about what happened at the scene?)No, it doesn't Leads to: \"No, Your Honor, it doesn't!\"Yes, it does Phoenix: Yes, I guess it does, Your Honor. (At least, I think so... But there's still something nagging at me...) Um, actually... can I change my mind on that, Your Honor...? Judge: ............You may, but only after you take responsibility for your first choice. Phoenix: (I'd better think this one through again...) Leads back to: \"Hmm............ Detective Arme fired two warning shots...\"Phoenix: No, Your Honor, it doesn't! \"Detective Arme fired two warning shots from a .38-caliber gun.\" But that doesn't explain the existence of a certain piece of evidence found at the scene. A piece... that points to the existence of a third person.Blackquill: Oh...?Judge: Very well. But it won't do to keep us waiting, Mr. Wright. What piece of evidence suggests the possibility of a third person at the scene?Present Bullet Phoenix: Leads to: \"And what is this metal pellet supposed to be?!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Don't you think that this piece of evidence seems incongruous? Judge: No, I don't think that at all. Phoenix: Not even just an eensy-weensy bit? Judge: No. What does seem incongruous to me, Mr. Wright, is your claim! Phoenix: (Urk... Looks like it wasn't this piece of evidence after all...) Your Honor! Please let me give it a little more thought! Leads back to: \"Very well. But it won't do to keep us waiting, Mr. Wright.\"Judge: And what is this metal pellet supposed to be?!Phoenix: Just a little something of great importance we found at the crime scene, Your Honor.Blackquill: You found it where?Phoenix: In a floor gutter at the crime scene. It looks like the police and prosecution both missed it. Furthermore, this is a .10-caliber bullet... ...making it much smaller than one of Detective Arme's .38-calibers.Judge: Th-Then that means...!Phoenix: Exactly. One more person must have been there in the lounge. A third person who had a gun that could fire .10-caliber bullets!Cosmos: Grnk!Phoenix: And if that's true, it explains why Detective Arme fired warning shots. This third person fired at Detective Arme and Director Cosmos with their gun. And in return, the detective fired her warning shots. Isn't that how it really went down, Director Cosmos?Cosmos: Ha ha ha! It looks like you've deduced my miraculous tale of survival! Yes, you're absolutely correct. The mystery person fired upon us!Judge: Wh-What's this, now?!Blackquill: What? You never breathed a word of any of this to me before...Cosmos: Ha ha ha! Well, all great men have a secret or two, don't you know!Blackquill: .........Tsk. Foolish old geezer.Phoenix: (So Director Cosmos really has been hiding the presence of a third person all along?) Director Cosmos! I want you to testify to the court about what you really saw!Judge: You may be a very great man, but, in my courtroom, you are just another witness. You won't receive special treatment here. Now, please give accurate testimony!Witness Testimony-- What I Really Saw at the Scene --Cosmos: Detective Arme and I rushed to the Control Room together. In the lounge, we saw a figure standing in the middle of the room, and Terran on the floor. We were still in the Control Room to the east when the figure fired at us!Judge: Hmm... Given that there was no third person in the lounge when the witness entered it... ...does this mean the person who fired the gun had to have been the defendant...?Phoenix: Not necessarily. It's still possible that it was someone else. Most likely, as soon as Detective Arme and Director Cosmos discovered this person... ...they escaped through the southern door, the one that didn't have a security lock.Blackquill:Blackquill: Double-edged swords are a tricky lot. Mishandle one and it is you who is cut down.Phoenix: Huh?Blackquill: Your reasoning could apply if Space Boy were the killer as well. Think about it. After being discovered, he could have fired the .10-caliber gun. Detective Arme would've responded by firing two warning shots. All he had to do was feign unconsciousness to invent the possibility of a third person.Phoenix:Phoenix: But Mr. Starbuck didn't have a gun in his possession when he was found by the police! Nor has a gun been found at the crime scene. Its absence can only be explained if there was a third party who took it with them.Blackquill:Blackquill: Recall the existence of a trash chute in the boarding lounge. The defendant could have simply thrown the gun down the chute.Phoenix:Phoenix: But you can't deny the possibility of a third person leaving with the weapon!Blackquill:Blackquill: It's up to you to prove that possibility. And I trust you haven't forgotten my little piece of decisive evidence?Phoenix: What evidence?Blackquill: Why, the detonator switch that was found in Mr. Starbuck's pocket, naturally. The most compelling evidence of all that tells us he is the culprit.Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh! (I-I DID forget all about that!)Blackquill: Look, Your Baldness, how deliciously obvious it is that they lack the evidence to rival mine.Athena: Wow, he sliced our third person theory to ribbons and served it to us, just like that...Judge: Yes, well, I have a question of my own, actually... That bullet that the mysterious figure shot... What did it hit exactly?Cosmos: ............It hit me.Judge: S-So does that mean you're a-a-a-a gh-ghost?!Blackquill: I was wondering when you would realize it, Your Baldness. Director Cosmos is an authentic, bona fide ghost. He can even pass through walls.Judge: Eeeeeeeeeeek!Athena:Athena: Prosecutor Blackquill! Shame on you for teasing the nice old gentleman!Blackquill: ...Hmph. Your Baldness, it was all in jest. Please show yourself again.Judge: A-Are you sure...? I-In that case... How did you manage to survive being shot, Director Cosmos?Cosmos: Ha ha ha! I'm glad you asked! It was a miracle! A miracle befitting a great, history-making figure such as myself! The bullet hit my glorious medal of honor, whereby it ricocheted, thus saving my life!Judge: WHAAAAAAAT?!Phoenix: Th-That's unbelievable...Athena: I have to check this out! .........Oh, wow. Look at that. There's one extra GYAXA star...Phoenix: The odds are literally astronomical... (I guess it really was a miracle...)Athena: It's beginning to feel like the cosmos is watching out for Director Cosmos.Judge: But why did you conceal this information, Director Cosmos?Cosmos: A great man such as myself has to hide things on occasion, no matter how much it hurts. It is the plight of the truly great! It may be hard for this generation to understand...Athena: I don't know, but it sounds fishy to me. What else is he hiding?Phoenix: ...Let's just cross-examine him and see what we can find out.Judge: Now then, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Really Saw at the Scene --Cosmos: Detective Arme and I rushed to the Control Room together.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: We've already heard all about that part. Don't you have any new information? Cosmos: Well... Let me see... ...If you have an hour or two, I could tell you all about the HAT-1 Miracle! Phoenix: Phoenix: We already know all about that, too! Tell us about something related to this incident! Cosmos: Hmm... I see.... You want to know about incidents. ...Well then, let me tell you about... the many incidents that made me the man I am today! Yes, if you have the time, I will tell you all about the upbringing of this great man! Phoenix: Phoenix: You've told us all about that already as well! What we need now is your testimony! Cosmos: ............Hmm? Did I really already tell you all about my upbringing? I don't recall doing so... Judge: Director Cosmos, perhaps you could save your boastful tales for later. Cosmos: If I must. Well, we peeked in through the Control Room door and...Cosmos: In the lounge, we saw a figure standing in the middle of the room, and Terran on the floor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But it was so dark, you couldn't see this figure's face, isn't that right? Cosmos: Yes, the room was as deep and dark as outer space itself. Speaking of outer space, during the HAT-1 launch seven years ago-- Blackquill: If it's about that \"HAT-1 Miracle\" again, you can sod off and tell it to a stray mutt. Cosmos: Ha ha ha! Excellent idea! No reason why the animal world shouldn't hear of my greatness! Blackquill: ...And so they shall. But first, your testimony. What happened next?Cosmos: We were still in the Control Room to the east when the figure fired at us!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, in other words... ...you were fired at while you were at the Control Room door. Cosmos: That is correct. Phoenix: (There's something not quite right about that...) Director Cosmos, the bullet this person fired hit you, isn't that right? Cosmos: Yes, it was a miracle! A miracle befitting a great, history-making figure such as myself! The bullet the figure fired hit me while I was in the Control Room. But as the cosmos would have it, the bullet bounced off my glorious medal of honor! Phoenix: (In that case, the bullet should've wound up somewhere around the Control Room door.)Present Bullet Phoenix: Leads to: \"Director Cosmos, I believe you are telling this great court a glorious lie!\"Athena: Okay, so Director Cosmos was in the Control Room to the east.Phoenix: And while he was there, he was shot at by someone with a .10-caliber gun.Athena: But the bullet hit his medal, so he was able to escape with his life. He's a very lucky man. No wonder people think he's great.Phoenix: (Hey, I'm pretty lucky myself, so if he's a great man, then I'm the king of all the cosmos!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Athena Cykes\nDescription: The latest lawyer to join our agency.

That's a contradiction because if the shot was fired from the lounge towards the east Control Room, the bullet should have been in the east area, not the south gutter. Alternatively, if the shooter was in the lounge, firing east towards the Control Room, then the bullet would travel towards the east, but the found bullet is in the south gutter. This suggests that the actual path of the bullet doesn't align with Cosmos's account of being in the Control Room when shot. \n\nTherefore, Testimony 2 (statement about being in the Control Room when fired upon) contradicts Evidence 12 (the bullet found in the south gutter of the lounge). The presence of the bullet in the lounge's gutter suggests the shooting happened there, not from the lounge towards the Control Room. This inconsistency implies that Cosmos's testimony about where they were when shot is false."

Nahyuta: ........................ Phoenix: Huh? Nahyuta: ........................ Phoenix: Umm... Judge: Quiet! Can't you see Prosecutor Sahdmadhi is absorbed in silent prayer? Phoenix: (Great. The trial's barely started and the judge is already mad at me.) Maya: He's very devout for a prosecutor. Judge: Hm? Why is the accused standing over there? Maya: Oh, umm... Well... Phoenix: Your Magistry. In addition to being the accused, she is also my assistant. Judge: The accused is your assistant, you say? ...Very well, then. A criminal does indeed make a fitting partner to a lawyer with a defiled soul. Maya: That... wasn't very nice. Phoenix: Yeah, well, bad-mouthing lawyers seems to be a custom of sorts here in Khura'in. Judge: I must say, I am surprised to see you still here in Khura'in, Mr. Wright. And even more so to find you in the Hall of Justice once more. I cannot fathom why you would willingly risk your life in yet another trial. Phoenix: The answer is simple, Your Magistry: I am a lawyer, and this is what lawyers do. (Although to be frank, I'd rather be anywhere but here right now...) Nahyuta: ........................... Such foolishness. Judge: Ah, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Are you ready to begin now? Nahyuta: Yes, Your Magistry. The prosecution is ready. Let us begin without further delay. But first, I promise you both this: I will cast your wicked souls into the fires of hell. Thus shall the soul of the victim attain salvation. Judge: Ha ha ha ha ha! Splendid! I would expect nothing less of you, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Gallery: Please save the victim's soul, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi!Punish the wicked lawyer who dares to stop these last rites! Phoenix: I think I'll pass on that whole fire and brimstone deal. But I'm not surprised by your words or stance, considering what Apollo's told me about you. Nahyuta: So, it was you who instilled that putrid lawyerly guile within him. Phoenix: P-Putrid... what? Nahyuta: He, too, must soon face the fires, lest his soul be lost to redemption. But I shall send you on ahead, so that he will not be lonely when he arrives. Phoenix: Sorry, but I'm afraid it won't be that easy. People say I never know when to give up! Nervous, Maya? Maya: A little... Phoenix: Feels like it's been ages since we stood side by side like this in court. Maya: Too bad I'm the defendant... Phoenix: Don't worry. We haven't lost a case together yet! Maya: You're right! Let's give this everything we've got, Nick! Judge: ...Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, would you please explain the case at hand? Nahyuta: Of course, Your Magistry. Let us begin the last rites of the victim. Maya Fey has been charged with the crime of murder. The victim of her heinous crime was high priest Tahrust Inmee. He was conducting the Purification Rite when he was brutally slain. Judge: And the cause of death? Nahyuta: Let us review the victim's autopsy report and the crime scene photo, shall we? The cause of death was blood loss from a stab wound delivered to the abdomen. The murder weapon was likely the Warbaa'd Dagger, which was used in the rite. However, the weapon has yet to be found, though the scene was thoroughly searched. Judge: A sacred relic used as a tool of murder? The Holy Mother's wrath shall be most severe. Nahyuta: The murder itself took place at the height of the Purification Rite. The accused had donned Lady Kee'ra's sacred robes. And the victim was there to offer prayers as a high priest of Khura'inism. During the rite, the victim and accused were the only two at the Inner Sanctum. Therefore, the only person who could have slain the victim is Maya Fey. Judge: Hmm... I must say, that does cast a great deal of suspicion upon the accused. Nahyuta: Indeed. Now then, allow me to submit this diagram of the crime scene as evidence in this case. Inner Sanctum Diagram added to the Court Record. Nahyuta: In Khura'inism, slaying a priest is a sin most grave and dreadful. As such, Maya Fey's soul shall be plunged into the lowest level of hell -- the Hell of Tickling. There, she shall be tickled without end for five hundred million years. (Changed from [There, she shall be tickled without end for 500 million years.] in the original release) Judge: That is a terrible fate indeed. Would the defense care to respond? Phoenix: (And here I thought the lowest level of hell was the Hell of Back Pain!) Maya: I don't remember killing anyone, and I don't have that dagger or anything like it! Phoenix: As my client stated, she has no memory of the event as described by the prosecution. But more importantly, she had no motive to kill the high priest in the first place! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Hmph. I thought you might say that. Nevertheless... The meaningless prattle of lawyers is utterly ineffectual here in the Hall of Justice. For all will be made clear by Her Benevolence Rayfa Padma Khura'in's Insights. Judge: So it is, and so it shall be. The Divination S\u00e9ance reveals the truth for all to see. Phoenix: (Here we go again!) Judge: Bailiff! Please show in the royal priestess! Gallery: It's Princess Rayfa! Oh, how beautiful Her Benevolence looks again today!Glory to the Holy Mother for this blessed day! Phoenix: (As popular as ever, I see.) Rayfa: Rest assured, good people of Khura'in. I will defeat this murderer and her abettor. They shall not escape on their Freedom Express today! Judge: What a joy it is to have the royal priestess back in the Hall of Justice! May the Holy Mother grant us her divine favor! Ur dihara Khura'in! Gallery: Ur dihara Khura'in!Ur dihara Khura'in! Phoenix: (She sure looks pleased with herself... Especially for someone who didn't know what a \"Freedom Express\" was until yesterday.) Rayfa: Hm? Is there something stuck to my face, Barbed Head? Phoenix: N-No, nothing, Your Benevolence. Judge: Now then, Your Benevolence, the Divination S\u00e9ance if you please. Rayfa: Very well... Nayna, my robe... O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination S\u00e9ance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls! Judge: The victim's mitamah has spoken... The Divination S\u00e9ance is complete. Phoenix: (Great... Another clearly incriminating S\u00e9ance vision.) Nahyuta: It could not be any clearer, O foul defense. The accused donned the sacred robes of Lady Kee'ra, and then attacked the victim. Judge: Oh, how very terrible it must have been. The figure of Lady Kee'ra lit against the dim lantern light... The scent of incense growing ever more potent as she drew near... One can almost sense the horror Abbot Inmee must have felt! Nahyuta: The facts as presented by Her Benevolence are indisputable. Maya: ...B-B-But! Th-That wasn't me! Do something, Nick! Phoenix: I-I'm working on it! (That couldn't have been any clearer. Looks like I'm in for another uphill battle.) Rayfa: The accused committed this vile act during our ancient tradition, Purification Rite. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, the Rites Guide explains the multipart Purification Rite in detail.) The Transformation Rite... The high priest reads scripture, while a priestess dons the robes of Lady Kee'ra. The Rite of Water... Lady Kee'ra enters the spring, and the high priest purifies her, along with her dagger. The Rite of Fire... The priestess circles the sacred flames to purify her soul. Rayfa: Indeed... It would seem that the murder occurred during the Transformation Rite. The rite dictates that the high priest stand in front of the spring. Therefore, the accused must have attacked him from the direction of the broken lantern. Well, Barbed Head? Would you care to object? Phoenix: Of course. Because I know my client is innocent! Rayfa: Heh heh, so you say. You truly do not know when you are beaten, do you? Phoenix: (I managed to pull it off last time with Ahlbi. I'll just have to do it again!) Judge: ...You intend to find fault with Her Benevolence's Insights yet again? It would seem lawyers are pohlkunan creatures indeed. Gallery: Look at that pohlkunan! Pohlkunan! Pohlkunan! Phoenix: ...Wh-What exactly is a \"pohlkunan\"? Maya: Someone who's a real piece of work, so to speak. Phoenix: (They can call me anything they want. The only thing I care about is uncovering the truth!) Rayfa: So, Barbed Head. Are you foolish enough to risk your life for your so-called truth? Because my Insights ARE the truth! To deny them is to willingly dig your own grave! Insight -- Rayfa's Insight -- Rayfa: The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra. As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly... ...he heard the accused's approaching footsteps and smelled her incense-laden robes. It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed. As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world. Rayfa: ...That is everything the victim experienced in his final moments. Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record. Nahyuta: Dressed in the sacred robes of Lady Kee'ra, the accused rushed the victim head-on. The brutal stabbing she perpetrated could not have been any clearer. Rayfa: Yes, it is plain for all to see. Maya: N-No, it wasn't me! A sudden drowsiness came over me during the Transformation Rite. I didn't even get a chance to put on Lady Kee'ra's robes! Nahyuta: You waste our time with such meaningless statements, accused. You cannot explain away the truths revealed by the royal priestess's divine Insight. Maya: Ooooh... ...How did you end up finding contradictions last time? Phoenix: The deceased's final memories include all five senses. Maya: Oh, you mean those words that appeared in the Pool of Souls? It looked to me like the bigger the word, the stronger the sensation was to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, that's how it looked to me, too. The sensations themselves are never wrong -- only their interpretations. That's why I tried to point out mistakes in Rayfa's Insights the last time. Maya: So, there could be contradictions between what Abbot Inmee felt and her Insights, huh! Phoenix: You got it. And I'm going to find them this time, too. (Should I check how to point out contradictions in Rayfa's Insights?) Let's check, just in case (I can switch between Insights with [left analog stick left / A] and [left analog stick right / D]... (Changed from [I can switch between Rayfa's Insights using these arrows on the Touch Screen or D-Pad/Circle Pad...] in the original release) ...while I look for inconsistencies between them and the sensations in the vision. (Changed from [...while I look for inconsistencies between them and the sensations on the upper screen.] in the original release) S\u00e9ance visions can be paused with [B / Z]. (Changed from [S\u00e9ance visions can be paused by touching \"Pause\" (L) on the Touch Screen.] in the original release) I can even jump to different points in the S\u00e9ance vision... ...using [A / M] and [Y / B]. (Changed from [...by moving the mitamah mark to a different panel or by pressing A or Y.] in the original release) When I see an Insight that doesn't seem right, I should \"Select\" ([X / Y / R]) it. (Changed from [When I see an Insight that doesn't seem right, I should touch \"Select\" (X).] in the original release) Then all I have to do is point out the sensation that contradicts with the Insight! The sensations this time seem to fluctuate more than the ones from Ahlbi's trial. In which case, I'd better keep an eye on changes in their intensity, too.) Leads to S\u00e9ance vision I'm okay Phoenix: (Nah, I remember how it works. Still... The sensations this time seem to fluctuate more than the ones from Ahlbi's trial. In which case, I'd better keep an eye on changes in their intensity, too. Okay! Time to point out the sensations that contradict the Insights!) Leads to S\u00e9ance vision The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra. As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly... ...he heard the accused's approaching footsteps and smelled her incense-laden robes. Present Footsteps (Sound) on fifth panel Phoenix: Leads to: \"The victim supposedly heard the accused's approaching footsteps.\" It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed. As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world. Phoenix: The victim supposedly heard the accused's approaching footsteps. But did he really? Rayfa: What nonsense is this?! Is it not abundantly clear?! Phoenix: No, it's not. Because there is something strange about those footsteps. Rayfa: S-Strange? Explain yourself, Barbed Head. Phoenix: The footsteps are strange because... The timing doesn't make sense Phoenix: The timing doesn't make any sense! There shouldn't be any footsteps! Rayfa: There should not be footsteps as the accused was approaching the victim? Really? Then do you suggest that the accused was actually floating through the air?! Phoenix: Well, I mean... Rayfa: .........I suggest you hold your tongue. Phoenix: S-Suggestion noted. (If that's not it, then...) But there's definitely something strange about those footsteps. They're strange because... Leads to: \"They're not getting any louder!\" They don't get louder Leads to: \"They're not getting any louder!\" Phoenix: They're not getting any louder! Judge: And why exactly does that matter? Phoenix: Please focus your attention on the incense the victim smelled. The scent grows stronger as the accused approaches. If the accused really had approached the victim... ...the sound of her footsteps would've grown louder as the scent of incense grew stronger! Rayfa: Ahhh! Judge: Wh-Why, that makes perfect sense! How can this be explained, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Um, w-well... There must be a reason... Nahyuta: Nahyuta: It is as they say... \"Even a putrid worm of a lawyer will turn.\" Phoenix: (What does that even mean...?) Maya: He's not exactly singing your praises, that's for sure. Nahyuta: Still, we cannot discount this information solely on account of its lawyerly source. Your Benevolence... Perhaps you must listen more carefully to the abbot's mitamah. Phoenix: (Listen more carefully? What's he talking about?) Rayfa: Hmm... Yes, it would appear so. I shall try to refine the sensation. Phoenix: R-Refine the sensation? Rayfa: I can more accurately gauge sensations by deepening my communication with a mitamah. Phoenix: I-I didn't know you could do that. (Why have we never done this before?!) Nahyuta: By refining a sensation, a clearer picture of the truth can be discovered. Rayfa: O blessed mitamah, I beseech you! Hear me now and respond to my call! S\u00c9ANCE VISION REFINED Judge: \"Footsteps\" changed into \"bells\"? What could this mean? Phoenix: (Bells? But the only bells at the scene of the crime were...) Maya: Ah! That jingling must've come from Abbot Inmee's bells! Phoenix: You mean those big things he had on his ankles? Nahyuta: Well, there you have it. The sound of bells was from the high priest's own footsteps. Rayfa: Th-Then that means...! Phoenix: If the footsteps belonged to the victim himself... It means it was the victim who was moving -- not the accused! The victim was the one who went running toward the broken lantern from the spring! A far cry from what Her Benevolence's Insight would have us believe! Rayfa: ...Nngh! Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record. Judge: But why would the victim have approached the accused? Phoenix: Maybe he was trying to defend himself. Judge: Please explain. Phoenix: He could've felt threatened by Lady Kee'ra standing there with a dagger. If so, he might have thought to overpower her before she attacked. Rayfa: Still your voices! This is nothing but a theory, and a poor one at that! B-Be not led astray by this lawyer's obvious postulation! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: While his insolence is inexcusable... ...I would ask that you calm yourself, Your Benevolence. Rayfa: Is there something you would care to say, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: Even if it was Abbot Inmee who moved, it does not negate the accused's crime. Phoenix: What do you mean? Nahyuta: The accused was likely waiting for the high priest to approach. Rayfa: Ah! Nahyuta: And as he neared, she plunged the dagger into him. It is as simple as that. Phoenix: (Oh, right... It really doesn't change much, does it...) Rayfa: Yes! It is as the prosecutor has said! In fact, it is as I meant to say all along as well! Phoenix: (Riiight... And that's why you were so shocked when you first heard it.) Rayfa: Understand now, lawyer? That contradiction you conjured up has come to naught. Once I hone my Insights, it will vanish like the dying rays of the sun! Insight Revised ...he heard the accused's approaching footsteps and smelled her incense-laden robes. ...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern. Rayfa: See? The fact that it was Abbot Inmee who moved... changes nothing! Phoenix: Arngh! (C'mon Phoenix. You gotta keep your cool. That contradiction I pointed out must mean something. That one sensation changed after Princess Rayfa refined her vision. It stands to reason that something else might have changed too because of the refinement. I should focus on any sensations that have changed... ...while searching for more contradictions between them and her Insights!) The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra. As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly... ...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern. Present Water (Sound) on fifth panel Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold it!\" It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed. As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world. Phoenix: Hold it! How do we know the Purification Rite was performed exactly as it was supposed to be? Rayfa: Hmph. That's easy. The customs governing the rite are very clear, and Abbot Inmee would've adhered to them. Phoenix: Well, that's strange. Judge: Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain just what is so strange? Phoenix: Yes. I would ask you to consider the sound of the victim's footsteps. The sound of bells changes to the sound of water at one point. Rayfa: What's this? Phoenix: It's simple. The victim must have stepped in some water. Nahyuta: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. And the only source of water in the Inner Sanctum... is the spring. ...And therein lies the contradiction! Rayfa: Wh-What contradiction? Phoenix: I believe the rite started out as it should have. The victim stood with his back to the spring, and the accused stood right in front of him. But, we now know that the victim then moved into the spring. Judge: P-Pohlkunka! That is absurd! Phoenix: This means the accused's location differs from what Her Benevolence's Insight indicates! Rayfa: ...Aaaungh! Judge: Th-Then, where do you propose the accused stood once she donned Lady Kee'ra's robes? Phoenix: (Based on the sound of the victim's footsteps, I believe Maya was standing here.) Present Spring Phoenix: Leads to: \"Until this moment, we've all just assumed...\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Judge: Do you really believe the accused was standing there? Phoenix: Umm... Not when you say it that way, Your Magistry... Judge: Keep making sloppy statements like that, Mr. Wright, and I'll have your tongue! Phoenix: Please... A-Anything but the chop-chop... Judge: Then let's have an actual answer out of you. Where do you believe the accused was actually standing? Leads back to: \"Based on the sound of the victim's footsteps, I believe Maya was standing here.\" Phoenix: Until this moment, we've all just assumed... ...that Abbot Inmee and Ms. Fey were standing where they were supposed to be... ...as shown in this rites guide. In short... The victim should've been standing with his back to the spring, and the accused in front. However, if that is how they were really standing... ...he couldn't have stepped into the spring as he approached her. The problem is, the victim DID step into the spring. This can only mean that Ms. Fey had actually been standing in the water! Judge: B-But if this is true... then their positions would've been completely reversed! Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record. Judge: Wh-What is going on here, Ms. Fey! Were you really standing in the spring? Maya: ...I-I'm sorry, but... I barely remember anything about the rite. Gallery: The high priest would never make such an obvious blunder during a rite!What on earth...? Is that even possible? Rayfa: Rayfa: Be that as it may, this does not overturn my Insights! Phoenix: ...It doesn't? Rayfa: Let us say the accused was standing in the spring. ...So what? Phoenix: ...\"So what\"? This completely reverses their positions is what! Rayfa: That their positions differed from what is customary is rather curious. However, what does that change? It certainly does not erase the accused's brutal crime! Phoenix: ..................I guess you have a point there. Rayfa: You lawyers are an absurd breed. Never thinking ahead, you cling to the first insignificant contradiction you can muster. Phoenix: Urk! Maya: Sounds like Princess Rayfa has a pretty good grasp on what lawyers are all about. Phoenix: ...Oh, Maya. Where would I be without your brutally frank commentary right now. (Is this contradiction really meaningless? But something really doesn't feel right. Did I take a wrong turn somewhere?) Rayfa: Hmph. I will now amend my Insight to account for this new truth. Insight Revised ...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern. ...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the pool-side lantern. Rayfa: Now the contradiction is no more. But the truth of the matter still stands, no matter how stubbornly you deny it. Judge: What do you have to say for yourself now, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Nnngh...! Maya: N-Nick! Nahyuta: Your Magistry, this lawyer may have raised a trivial objection... ...but Her Benevolence's Insights have no further inadequacies of any kind. Judge: Yes... So it would seem. Phoenix: Wait a second! But there IS another contradiction! Nahyuta: Still you flounder about? Wretched beast... Though you rack that putrid brain of yours, nothing worthwhile will come of it. Phoenix: M-Maya, please tell me you remember something that might help us out here... Maya: Sorry... I really don't remember a thing. But now that the place I was standing in has changed, who knows? That alone may cause a new discrepancy with Princess Rayfa's Insights. Phoenix: (That's right. We now know that Maya was standing in the spring. A major change like that could very well produce a contradiction. I should take another look at the Inner Sanctum diagram in the Court Record... ...and confirm where Maya and Abbot Inmee were standing. And then focus on finding any discrepancies between their positions and the Insights.) The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra. As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly... ...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the spring-side lantern. Present lantern (Sight) on fourth panel Phoenix: Leads to: \"Your Benevolence... I've found a new contradiction.\" It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed. As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world. Phoenix: Your Benevolence... I've found a new contradiction. Rayfa: You... You did? Hmph. No doubt it is but another of your vile attempts to slander my Insights. Phoenix: Nope. Take a good look at what the victim saw. It just might change your mind. The lantern flame behind the accused was flickering. Rayfa: There is nothing unusual about that. Especially as the wind had stirred. Phoenix: No, that's where you're wrong. If the accused had been standing in the spring... ...then what you see here should be one of the lanterns flanking the statue. Rayfa: I fail to see your point. Phoenix: My point is, something is wrong here. The two lanterns flanking the statue were both outfitted with glass wind guards. So neither lantern's flame should have been flickering in the wind in the first place! Rayfa: ........................Heh. Maya: She seems pretty tickled, Nick! Phoenix: I don't remember saying anything funny. Rayfa: I fail to see what you wish to prove here, but... very well. I shall refine the vision and reveal the truth for all to see. O blessed mitamah, I beseech you! Fix your sight upon the lantern there. S\u00c9ANCE VISION REFINED Phoenix: H-Huh? That lantern doesn't have a wind guard on it. Rayfa: And rightly so. For the wind guard was removed to reveal the sacred flame within for the Rite of Fire. Therefore, there is nothing odd about the flame flickering. Phoenix: S-Say whaaat?! B-But when we searched the crime scene, those lanterns had their wind guards on! Nahyuta: That's because the police put them back on. The sacred flames have burned uninterrupted for hundreds of years, defense. We could not risk them being extinguished, even during an investigation. Phoenix: Th-That would never fly back home... Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Are you done quibbling? If so, then it is time to bow down before this testimony of the mitamah! Phoenix: .........Arnghk! Maya: Nick...! Phoenix: ...Don't worry, Maya! I'm just getting started! (All right, let's go over everything we know so far. Maya was wearing Lady Kee'ra's robes and standing in the spring. The high priest is thought to have been moving toward her. So I should look for sensations that stand in contradiction to this arrangement. I won't give up! I'm going to find a contradiction that will undermine the accusation against Maya!) The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra. As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly... ...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the spring-side lantern. Present broken lantern (Sight) on second panel Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wh-What could this possibly mean?\" It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed. As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world. Phoenix: (Wh-What could this possibly mean? That lantern clearly contradicts the Insight... But this contradiction... ...will overturn the entire case I've been building.) Judge: Are you all right, Mr. Wright? One minute you shout out, and in the next, you fall silent. Rayfa: Perhaps it is like the bellow of one who is barreling down a hill with no way of stopping. Is that not right, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: .................. Phoenix: (Don't get cold feet now, Phoenix. Even if this overturns the entire case you've built so far... ...the only way is to keep moving forward -- because that's where we'll find the truth!) ...Sorry, but I'm not barreling down a hill. In fact, I'm in full control of everything with the indisputable contradiction I found! Rayfa: Is that so? Phoenix: The lantern behind the accused clearly-- No, BLATANTLY contradicts your Insight! Rayfa: Does it now...? Phoenix: One of the lanterns on the entrance side of the Inner Sanctum was broken. And if you watch what Abbot Inmee saw in his final moments... ...you will notice that the lantern behind the praying form of Ms. Fey is broken. The lantern behind Lady Kee'ra, however, is still intact. In short, we are seeing two different lanterns in this S\u00e9ance vision! Rayfa: H-How could this be?! And even if it were so, how would that contradict my Insights?! Phoenix: .................. Let me start by saying, the claim I'm about to raise... ...will overturn the case I've built thus far. Judge: Will the defense please explain himself? Phoenix: Based on the broken lantern, we can tell... Maya and Abbot Inmee's positions Leads to: \"Where the accused and the victim were standing!\" The lanterns positions Phoenix: The correct position of the lanterns! Rayfa: But did you not just explain that yourself? Phoenix: Oh, did I? Judge: The defense will own up to its own statements! Phoenix: (I'd better stop filling His Magistry's anger meter...) Judge: The fact that there was a broken lantern does not change anything. Phoenix: I beg to differ, Your Magistry! There is one thing it makes clear. And that is... Leads to: \"Where the accused and the victim were standing!\" Phoenix: Where the accused and the victim were standing! Judge: But did you not just finish asserting that the accused was standing somewhere else?! Phoenix: I did. And I built my argument on that faulty premise. But thankfully, it has led us here... ...to the actual spot where Maya Fey was standing! Judge: I must say, if the defense keeps changing its assertions in such a capricious manner... ...its credibility may come into question. Phoenix: I'm willing to take that risk, Your Magistry, because I believe this will be the last time. I'd like to start by pointing out the actual spot where the accused was standing. Judge: Very well... Show us where you now believe the accused was actually standing. Phoenix: (Based on the location of the broken lantern, where was Maya really standing?) Present area between southern lanterns Phoenix: Leads to: \"I wasn't thinking straight before, but now it's all falling into place.\" Present anywhere else Judge: Hmm... And you are sure it was there? Phoenix: Oh, uh, my hand slipped. Sorry, can we just say that one didn't count? Judge: Counting such baffling gaffes is my job, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Well, it was worth a try... (I need to think about the location of the broken lantern. That should make the spot where Maya was standing more than apparent!) Judge: O Holy Mother of Khura'in, Mr. Wright! You remind us yet again why lawyers are reviled. This time, see that you point out where the accused was really standing. Leads back to: \"Based on the location of the broken lantern, where was Maya really standing?\" Phoenix: I wasn't thinking straight before, but now it's all falling into place. We know the victim had stepped into the spring. That means Maya Fey had to have been standing in the water as he approached. However, his memory, which has only now become clear, reveals that... ...Ms. Fey was standing by the side of the broken lantern. In other words... ...she was standing where she was supposed to be according to custom. Rayfa: Rayfa: Does that not bring us back to the very beginning?! Phoenix: No, this is where things take a different turn -- and I mean that literally. The victim had to have been moving toward the spring. That means that while he was moving, he had his back turned toward the accused! Rayfa: What's this?! Do you mean to say the victim turned around during the rite?! But such an image appears nowhere in the S\u00e9ance vision! Phoenix: Actually, it does appear. It's just that no one noticed until now. Judge: N-No one noticed?! How could no one have noticed something so big?! Phoenix: There was a moment when the scripture the victim was holding was all we could see. Thanks to that, none of us could tell that he was, in fact, turning around in that moment. Rayfa: ...Nngh! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: If it is as the defense asserts, then Her Benevolence's Insights no longer make sense. How do you intend to explain that? Phoenix: Phoenix: I don't need to explain anything, because it's just as you said, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Her Benevolence's Insights DON'T make any sense because they contain a huge error! Rayfa: ...S-Such insolence! Judge: A huge error, you say? Do explain. Phoenix: The huge error is... The order of the rites Phoenix: The order in which the smaller rites were performed is all wrong! But there's only one way to tell. So let's ask for confirmation from someone who was actually there. Well, Maya? Maya: Sorry, Nick... I was out cold, so I don't remember a thing. Judge: ...It seems there is no way to know. Phoenix: (Nngh...) Judge: But what I'm wondering is... ...what does the order of the rites have to do with this case in the first place? Phoenix: ............Truth be told, I hadn't considered that yet. Judge: Consider the meaning behind this penalty, then! Phoenix: Consider it done, Your Magistry... Your Magistry! Please give me another chance! Judge: ...Very well. But do not test my patience any further. Now, tell me. What is the huge error in Her Benevolence's Insights? Leads back to: \"The huge error is...\" The crime scene Phoenix: The scene of the crime is wrong! Rayfa: But the vision clearly shows that Abbot Inmee was murdered at the Inner Sanctum! Phoenix: Could there be another place that looks just like it? Judge: ...No, there can't. Phoenix: (Agh. If that's not it, then...) Your Magistry! Please give me another chance! Judge: ...Very well. But do not test my patience any further. Now, tell me. What is the huge error in Her Benevolence's Insights? Leads back to: \"The huge error is...\" The number of people there Leads to: \"I believe this is what happened at the scene of the crime:\" Phoenix: I believe this is what happened at the scene of the crime: The victim was reading a sutra when suddenly, he sensed someone behind him. He immediately looked back to see someone dressed as Lady Kee'ra standing there. Wishing to see who it was, he approached the robed figure. That's when he was stabbed! Rayfa: This cannot be! Phoenix: Oh, but it can. And it is! The Insight stating the accused stabbed the victim is wrong! And that is the real truth lying behind this testimony of the dead! Rayfa: Po... Judge: Po... Nahyuta: Po... Rayfa: Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Judge: A- Are you suggesting... ...that there was someone else at the scene of the crime?! Rayfa: Hnnnnnngh! Have I misunderstood... the voice of the mitamah... yet again? ...Th-This--! This cannot be! Phoenix: (Whew... That was a close one. But I managed to divine the true meaning behind the S\u00e9ance vision somehow. I should add these new facts to the Court Record.) Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record. Nahyuta: Your Benevolence, please allow me to take it from here. I will overturn the brash accusations of this faithless, putrid-minded lawyer. Rayfa: Y-Yes... I shall place my trust in you. Judge: Are you sure about this, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: My work as an international prosecutor has taken me to courtrooms around the world. And in that time, I have learned to perform last rites for souls in trials lacking a S\u00e9ance. Judge: Yes, of course. Forgive my ludicrous inquiry. Nahyuta: Moreover, I have with me a forensic investigator from overseas. I will show you all the most magnificent last rites ever seen. Phoenix: (I guess he really does think highly of Ema and her forensic expertise. I'm impressed that he's come to understand their value. Then again... ...he IS an international prosecutor who's solved tough cases around the world. Time to hunker down, huh...) Judge: Now then, let us continue with today's proceedings. Could the defense please tell us who the third party dressed as Lady Kee'ra was? Your new claim has negated the Insights of the royal priestess... ...so I trust you have some evidence to support it, correct? Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. (This third party must have really wanted to kill the high priest. I might be able to identify who it was if I had evidence of their murderous intent!) Judge: Well, we're waiting, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: The evidence that can reveal the identity of the third party... is this! Present Lady Kee'ra's Warning Phoenix: Leads to: \"Three days before the Purification Rite...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This piece of evidence tells us who the third party is! Nahyuta: Ah, yes. I suppose this evidence does clearly demonstrate one thing: The fact that you are lowlier than the lowliest of worms, that is. Judge: Even a lawyer like you cannot not worm your way out of this one, defense. Phoenix: Nngh, talk about opening up a can of worms... Your Magistry, I'd like to present another piece of evidence! Judge: Well, it seems the worm is not without a spine. Very well. What other evidence do you have for us today? Leads back to: \"The evidence that can reveal the identity of the third party... is this!\" Phoenix: Three days before the Purification Rite... ...the victim received a warning letter from an unidentified individual! Judge: He did?! Phoenix: Whoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, \"Do not perform the rite.\" But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered. Judge: Who do you suppose sent that letter? Phoenix: A person with something to hide -- the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra herself! Judge: Peace! I-I... I don't understand. I had heard the Lady Kee'ra that has been in the news of late only hunted rebels. If so, why would she have killed the high priest? Phoenix: Excellent question. Maybe it would help to think of it this way: What if the high priest... had secretly been a rebel?! Gallery: The high priest?! He couldn't possibly have been a rebel! Judge: The high priest -- a devout follower of Khura'inism... a rebel?! Do you even comprehend the blasphemy of which you speak? Well? DO YOU?! Phoenix: I, too, found it hard to believe at first. But as I continued my investigation, it started to become more and more plausible. Nahyuta: Nahyuta: The third party was the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra? And the high priest was a rebel? Your mockery of Khura'inism... No... ...of the Kingdom of Khura'in itself knows no bounds! Phoenix: (Whoops.) Gallery: That shameless pohlkunan lawyer...He's making a mockery of our religion! Judge: ...As a faithful Khura'inist, I take issue with these claims. And I am loath to admit them into today's proceedings. Phoenix: (I don't like where this is going.) Nahyuta: The defense's claims are but vile blasphemy tantamount to spitting on the Holy Mother. Phoenix: I-Is it really that big of a deal, Maya...? Maya: Abbot Inmee was a distinguished monk, and very well-respected, too, so... yeah. Phoenix: (Ugh... Please don't let this turn into an international incident...) Nahyuta: But fear not, good people of Khura'in. The rantings of this putrid-brained lawyer who seeks to sully the soul of the deceased... ...shall come to no avail once I conclude these last rites. The prosecution's assertion that the accused killed the victim remains unchanged. Phoenix: B-But...the victim was stabbed in his abdomen! How is that possible when he had his back turned toward Ms. Fey?! Someone else must have killed him! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Are you sure about that? You may have invalidated the S\u00e9ance, but do not let it go to your putrid head. The karmic flow of this trial is, as yet, still in my hands. Phoenix: (How can he be so confident?) Nahyuta: Heh heh heh... Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a deluded fantasy. And I shall prove that by calling a new witness to the stand. ...An eyewitness who will deliver a definitive answer that will dispel the defense's doubts. Phoenix: A-An eyewitness...? Judge: Very well. Let us call this eyewitness to the stand. Phoenix: (It's him again!) Judge: Well, now... He has to be the shaggiest witness I have ever laid eyes upon. Please state your name and occupation. ???: Oh, um... I'm, ya know, that so-and-so, whatchamacallit! A'nohn Ihmus TBD! 'Least that's what they've been calling me! Judge: \"TBD\"? As in \"to be determined\"? Can't you just tell us your real name? Nahyuta: The witness has suffered a blow to the head, rendering him amnesiac. Therefore... ...I named him \"A'nohn Ihmus (TBD)\" in my report, but he thinks \"TBD\" is part of his name. Phoenix: Phoenix: You're letting an amnesiac testify?! Nahyuta: Have no fear. I have already questioned him at length. While it is true he has utterly forgotten his name and past... ...his memory of what he witnessed is still very much intact. Judge: Considering the dearth of information, any new knowledge may be of help. Therefore, I will permit his testimony. Now, Mr. Ihmus, please tell us what you saw. Ihmus: .................. Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder -- Ihmus: That night, I was up at the top of Mt. Poniponi, the mountain next to the Inner Sanctum. I hate crowds, so I climbed up there to pray in peace. I know it's a no-no, but since there was no one around... ...I used my binoculars to spy on the rite at the Inner Sanctum. That's when I saw the accused... stab the high priest with a dagger! Phoenix: There's no way you saw Ms. Fey stab the victim with a dagger! Maya: I-I swear I don't know what he's talking about! ...Or don't remember, at any rate! Judge: Mt. Poniponi... the beautiful mountain that is also known as the Little Sanctum. Phoenix: (They must be talking about that smaller mountain from the poster...) Judge: Mr. Ihmus, I was wondering... Ihmus: What can I do ya for? Judge: The Inner Sanctum lies at a high elevation where clouds and fog can obscure the view. Are you sure you were able to see what happened from the mountaintop next to it? Phoenix: (Good point!) H-His Magistry raises an excellent question! Well, Mr. Ihmus?! Ihmus: On the day of the rite, there wasn't a cloud in the sky! I had a perfect view! If ya don't believe me, check the weather forecast in the paper that day! Maya: Nick! Don't we have the newspaper for that day?! Phoenix: Yeah, let's take a look. Hmm... It does say calm, clear skies, doesn't it? Ihmus: See? Told ya so! May 9th Newspaper updated in the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... Well, it would appear the witness has offered testimony worth hearing. Nahyuta: ...Mr. Ihmus. I, too, have a question for you. Phoenix: (Didn't he already question the witness?) Ihmus: Well, that's what I'm here for, right? Shoot! Nahyuta: How was the accused holding the dagger? Was she holding it underhanded, its blade protruding from the bottom of her hand? Ihmus: Yep, I believe she was! It's called a reverse grip! Nahyuta: Ah... I thought as much. Phoenix: Phoenix: Hold it right there! What bearing does that have on this case? Nahyuta: Cease your interruptions, you putrid-headed lawyer. Do you not see the significance in how the blade was held? Phoenix: Why don't you enlighten me, O enlightened one? Nahyuta: Feh. I knew you were a fool. I can already picture you in your next life. Phoenix: N-Next life...? Nahyuta: Yes... After your soul writhes for centuries in the pits of hell... ...you shall be reborn as a witless sea urchin, with barbs limited to your posterior. You shall live a short, inconsequential life, only to be brutally devoured by a sea otter. Phoenix: (That was a bit excessive. I simply asked what the dagger grip had to do with the case.) Nahyuta: Now, pay attention. How the accused held the dagger is of vital importance. With such information, we can infer exactly what actions she took. You were saying that the victim was killed while he had his back to the accused. Is that correct? Phoenix: Y-Yes... Nahyuta: As such, the accused's dagger grip tells us something very important: The accused approached the victim from behind, swung her arms around him... ...and plunged the dagger deep into his abdomen, using a reverse grip! Phoenix: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Nahyuta: Thus, Mr. Ihmus's testimony clears up any doubts that might remain. Judge: Ha ha ha! And it coincides with Her Benevolence's Insights as well! Phoenix: (This is a disaster! I thought I'd blown those Insights out of the water, but now they're back to haunt me!) Judge: Now then, the defense may cross-examine the witness. Cross-Examination -- The Night of the Murder -- Ihmus: That night, I was up at the top of Mt. Poniponi, the mountain next to the Inner Sanctum. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure you're not mistaken, Mr. Ihmus? Was it really Mt. Poniponi that you climbed? Ihmus: Oh, I'm sure of it! It was a really poniponi-ish mountain! Phoenix: (What does that even mean?) Ihmus: Ya know, now that I think about it, it was a mighty fine view! Ihmus: I hate crowds, so I climbed up there to pray in peace Press Phoenix: Phoenix: If you hate crowds, why bother climbing to the top? Couldn't you have just as easily prayed at the bottom of Mt. Poniponi? Ihmus: Wrong, bucko! This is a once-a-year, epic event! I wanted to pray as close to the actual thing as possible! Phoenix: If you're so gung-ho about it, why didn't you go pray at the Plaza of Devotion? Ihmus: Like I said, I hate crowds. I wanted to pray in peace! Phoenix: (O Holy Mother, why do I only get the annoying ones...?) Ihmus: And my burning faith demanded that I climb up the mountain closest to the Inner Sanctum! Also... Ihmus: I know it's a no-no, but since there was no one around... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Since nobody was around... ...there is nobody who can corroborate your actions, either. Ihmus: Hee-HO! Y-You're exactly right! Phoenix: In that case, Mr. Ihmus, let me ask you this: Was there a reason you didn't want to be seen? Ihmus: Uh... About that... If ya get caught climbing the surrounding mountains on the day o' the rite... ...ya can get in big, big trouble!  Har har har har har! Phoenix: ...Th-That's it? Ihmus: Yeah, it's totally embarrassing getting yelled at when you're a grown-up! Har har har har har! Phoenix: Yeah, you're a real \"grown-up,\" all right... Ihmus: And since nobody was around, I lost all inhibition and... Ihmus: ...I used my binoculars to spy on the rite at the Inner Sanctum. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You had a pair of binoculars with you? That's pretty convenient. You weren't planning to spy on the rite all along, were you? Ihmus: A-Actually, I just happened to have 'em for bird watching. Phoenix: Bird watching, huh...? I see. Maya: You're not going to keep pressing him on this? Phoenix: He's sketchy as heck, but I don't really have anything I can really sink my teeth into yet. Maya: Oh... okay then. Ihmus: Haaar har har har har! I love the great outdoors! That's just the kinda guy I am! A guy called... A'nohn Ihmus TBD! Phoenix: .................. Maya: H-He's... really starting to get on my nerves. Ihmus: As I looked through my binoculars, I couldn't believe what was unfolding before me. Present Ritual Curtain Phoenix: Leads to: \"Your Magistry!\" Ihmus: That's when I saw the accused... stab the high priest with a dagger! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you really see what you say you did? Ihmus: Are ya saying I'm lying about this?! Well, I'm not! It's etched permanently in this old noggin! Maya: B-But, I didn't do what you say I did... I didn't even get a chance to touch the dagger on the day of the rite! Ihmus: Whadda I know o' that? All I know is what I saw! I've never even seen ya before in my life. What possible reason could I have to lie?! Phoenix: Urrrrrrgh...! Phoenix: (I didn't expect there to be any witnesses way up there.) Maya: B-But, I... I don't remember doing that at all! Phoenix: I know. I have a feeling the witness is lying. There has to be an inconsistency somewhere in his testimony. (I should take another look at the Court Record.) Phoenix: Your Magistry! I had my doubts about this bushy-bearded witness, but now I KNOW we can't trust him. Ihmus: What?! You ain't just judging me solely on my bodacious beard, are ya? Phoenix: Not at all, Mr. Ihmus. It's much more than your sketchy appearance. It's your sketchy testimony. Judge: H-His testimony, you say?! Phoenix: Yes. Recall how the Inner Sanctum was that day. Specifically, that it was completely enclosed by the ritual curtain. Judge: Why yes! I believe you're right! Phoenix: The curtain would have completely blocked the witness's view from Mt. Poniponi. Therefore, he couldn't possibly have seen the murder happen! Ihmus: Hoo-hah...! Judge: Mr. Ihmus, have you been knowingly making false statements to this court?! Ihmus: Err... Umm... Well, uhhh... AAIEEEEEE! YA GOT MEEEEEEEEEE!!! Judge: The witness will lower his voice! Ihmus: I didn't actually see the accused herself! Phoenix: (He \"didn't actually see the accused herself\"? What's that supposed to mean?) Ihmus: Lemme set the record straight! I beg ya! Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder (Amended) -- Ihmus: I saw their shadowy silhouettes, projected against the ritual curtain! The figures were created by the light of the full moon on that clear and still night. She was just a shadow, but I could tell it was the accused, reverse-gripping that dagger! Phoenix: Sh-Shadows...? That's what you saw? Ihmus: That's right. I could see what was going on by the shadows projected onto the ritual curtain. Judge: In the future, Mr. Ihmus, I would rather you offer up accurate testimony from the start. Ihmus: Forgive me, my main man Mr. Magistry. Chalk it up to my fuzzy memory! Nahyuta: Though he saw but shadows, it is still valuable testimony. Phoenix: (You have to be kidding me...) Maya: Wh-What are we going to do now, Nick?! Phoenix: Umm... All I can think of is... ...to look for inconsistencies between the actual rite and what Mr. Ihmus says he saw. Judge: Now then, the defense may cross-examine the witness once more. Cross-Examination -- The Night of the Murder (Amended) -- Ihmus: I saw their shadowy silhouettes, projected against the ritual curtain! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So what you saw were simply shadows...? Ihmus: ...That's right. Those shadow figures on that bright white curtain... They showed through plain as day. I could see everything that happened! Phoenix: But Ms. Fey and Abbot Inmee were at the top of a mountain, late at night. The only light up there was coming from four small lanterns. How could the shadows have been projected that clearly onto the curtain? Ihmus: No wonder people harp on you lawyers! You're always so dang skeptical! The lanterns weren't the only sources of light, ya know! Ihmus: The figures were created by the light of the full moon on that clear and still night. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You claim to have seen shadowy figures that were projected onto the ritual curtain. But did you really see them, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: 'Course I did! The bright moonlight projected them onto that curtain, clear as day. It was like watching a scene out o' a horror movie from my front row seat on Mt. Poniponi! Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess the moon does shine a bit brighter when you're way up there...) Maya, do you recall how bright the moon was that night? Maya: Umm... I remember there weren't any clouds, and that the moon was definitely out. But I don't remember if it could cast any shadows. Phoenix: Okay, thanks. (We can't deny that the moon was really bright. Which means it's possible that it was bright enough to cause shadows to appear.) Ihmus: Har har har har har! I remember it just like it happened! Present Rites Guide Phoenix: Leads to: \"You saw silhouettes projected by the moonlight?\" Ihmus: She was just a shadow, but I could tell it was the accused, reverse-gripping that dagger! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How do you know it was Ms. Fey, if all you saw were shadows? Ihmus: It was that little bun on toppa her head! Didn't need to see her face. That distinctive bob's a dead giveaway! Never underestimate my keen sense o' observation! Har har har har har! Now that's one funny haircut! Maya: It's not nice to make fun of a girl's hairstyle! I like my hair this way! Besides! You're one to talk, you sasquatch! Ihmus: You're not into this wild, manly look I'm sporting? Shows what you know, little girl! Haaar har har har har! Maya: Nick...!  Isn't there some kind of a crime you can charge him with?! Phoenix: I-I'm afraid it doesn't work that way... Phoenix: Now he claims he only saw shadows? His testimony has sketchy written all over it. Maya: Then there must be an inconsistency in there somewhere! Phoenix: ...Yep. (Was he really watching everything from Mt. Poniponi? If so, then I should see how his testimony lines up with the conditions of the rite.) Phoenix: You saw silhouettes projected by the moonlight? Sorry, but that's just not possible. Ihmus: Wh-Whaddaya mean?! How's it not possible that it was totally possible?! That's impossible! Phoenix: (I think I'm going to need a \"logicalese\" translation on that...) Let's take a look at this rites guide, shall we, Mr. Ihmus? The rite is held \"when the moon is directly over the summit of Mt. Poniponi.\" Ihmus: Doot doot doooooot... Phoenix: So if the moon was shining from the west, shadows would've been cast eastward. But Mr. Ihmus was standing to the west of the Inner Sanctum on Mt. Poniponi. Judge: O Holy Mother! Phoenix: That's right. Our witness here couldn't have seen any shadowy figures on that curtain! Ihmus: N-N-No... NO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY-HEE-HEE-HEEEE! Judge: Hmm... Perhaps it was the sacred flames of the lanterns that cast the shadows he saw? Phoenix: I'm afraid not. I inspected them during my investigation, but... ...the flames were too small to cast the crisp, distinct figures Mr. Ihmus claims to have seen. Ihmus: But...! I did see those silhouettes! Really! Maya: But how could he, Nick? Phoenix: Maybe he was someplace where they WERE visible...? (Wait... Don't tell me...!) Your Magistry! If Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows, it brings a brand-new fact to light! Judge: And that would be...? Phoenix: The brand-new fact that comes to light if Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows is... He didn't see the murder Phoenix: He didn't see the murder! Ihmus: But I just told ya I DID see the silhouettes on the curtain! If you think I didn't see the murder, then prove it! Phoenix: I can't actually prove it, but my lawyer's intuition tells me you didn't see it! Judge: Mr. Wright, you shall have to do better than that. Unless you want more of these, anyway. Phoenix: (He's saying he saw the shadows from Mt. Poniponi, which I've shown is impossible. In that case...) Your Magistry. If Mr. Ihmus really did see the shadows, there can be only one explanation. Leads to: \"He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!\" He was somewhere else Leads to: \"He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!\" Phoenix: He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder! Ihmus: D-Doot doot dooooot... Judge: Oh? Then where do you propose the witness was? Phoenix: Someplace where he could have seen the shadow figures, naturally! Maya: Wait! You mean... Phoenix: None of the mountains east of the Inner Sanctum are close enough for a good view. That leaves only one place he could've clearly seen the shadows from. Judge: ...And where might that be? Phoenix: This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder. The Plaza of Devotion Phoenix: He was at the Plaza of Devotion! Nahyuta: Do you truly believe Mr. Ihmus could see the Inner Sanctum from there? Phoenix: He must have really good eyes. Ihmus: Ooh, I do pride myself on my excellent vision! But still, you think I could've seen the Inner Sanctum with a big ol' mountain in the way? Judge: It's not a matter of good eyesight, defense. I must punish you for not seeing that. Phoenix: Argh... Should've seen that coming... (All righty, then...) Judge: You lawyers are a desperate lot, aren't you. Phoenix: Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'll get it right this time! Leads back to: \"This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.\" The high priest's home Phoenix: He was at the high priest's home! Judge: And just how do you propose he saw those curtain shadows from there? Phoenix: Umm, the witness must be clairvoyant. Judge: Clairvoyant?! Is this true, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: Do I look like a psychic nutjob to you? Judge: ...Not a psychic one, at any rate. Phoenix: (Well, at least the insult wasn't directed at me this time.) Judge: You lawyers are a desperate lot, aren't you. Phoenix: Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'll get it right this time! Leads back to: \"This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.\" The Inner Sanctum Leads to: \"Mr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side!\" Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side! That's the only place from which he could've seen the shadowy figures! Ihmus: Hoo-haaaaaah! Nahyuta: .........Ngh! Maya: Really?! Wow, I didn't even think of that! Judge: But wasn't the Inner Sanctum off-limits to all but the victim and the accused? Phoenix: And the third party who was there, you mean. I get the feeling that's a subject Prosecutor Sahdmadhi would rather not touch right now. Nahyuta: ..................... Judge: Ah, you mean...! Phoenix: That's right. This witness was at the scene of the crime. Which means he is the mysterious third party we saw during the Divination S\u00e9ance. He could be the one who dressed as Lady Kee'ra and killed the high priest! Ihmus: Goo-geeeeeeh! Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaat?! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: No one but the two participants were allowed anywhere near the Inner Sanctum. And the only way up there are the stairs that start down at the Plaza of Devotion. So tell me: How do you propose the witness entered that sacred space? Phoenix: Oh, umm... He must've, uhhh... (I haven't thought THAT far ahead...) Judge: The sanctum has sheer cliffs on three sides and a steep, towering rock face on the other. No one could have made it there by climbing the faces of those cliffs. Nahyuta: His Magistry speaks true. To say Mr. Ihmus was at such an inaccessible location is but a bid to tarnish his credibility. Is that not right? Ihmus: Right! I wasn't at the Inner Sanctum! No sir, no how! At least I'm pretty sure I wasn't! Phoenix: Phoenix: T-Then, what about those silhouettes you claim to have seen? Ihmus: I'm starting to think I've been imagining things! Phoenix: What?! Th... This is insane! Gallery: I knew we couldn't trust that lawyer. He's trying to frame the witness! Judge: Peace! Peace, I say! Phoenix: (This is impossible! Unless I can show how he got to the Inner Sanctum... ...it just looks like I'm trying to slander Mr. Ihmus.) Maya: I believe in you, Nick! Rah, rah, siss boom bah! Fight, fight, Phoenix Wright! Gallery: Just look at the accused. Has she no shame? Maya: What's your problem, lady?! Phoenix Wright is very trustworthy, I'll have you know! Gallery: She's got some nerve for a criminal! I bet that lawyer poisoned her mind. Phoenix: P-Please, Maya, you're only making it worse. I appreciate the vote of confidence, but it's probably best to keep it to yourself for now... Judge: I would advise the defense to think carefully before making any more sudden outbursts. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Magistry... (If I wasn't the bad guy before, I definitely am now!) Nahyuta: Now, Mr. Ihmus. I would like you to think back carefully... ...before you testify next about where you were that night. Witness Testimony -- I Wasn't at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: I was never at the Inner Sanctum, I tell ya! That much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory. Besides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place! Boy, you lawyers sure are scary! Phoenix: (I guess it might've been impossible for him to get to the Inner Sanctum like he claims, but...) Nahyuta: Now will you desist in trying to frame this innocent witness? Gallery: Yeah! I'd like to see you explain how he got up there! Judge: Mr. Wright. Is it not time to end these cross-examinations? Nahyuta: \"A moment of desperation leads to one hundred million years of torment.\" (Changed from ['A moment of desperation leads to 100 million years of torment.'] in the original release) It means that for each moment a sinner spends struggling to deny their sins... ...one hundred million years of torment are added to their time in hell. (Changed from [...100 million years of torment are added to their time in hell.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Khura'inism is the strictest religion ever!) Nahyuta: And just so you know, you've already accrued two hundred million extra years. (Changed from [And just so you know, you've already accrued 200 million extra years.] in the original release) Gallery: Plus the five they started with... that's seven hundred million years of torment! (Changed from [Plus the 500 million years they started with... that's 700 million years of torment!] in the original release) Maya: Sure, what's another two hundred million, give or take. (Changed from [Sure, what's another 200 million, give or take.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Well, it's a big deal to me! I can't keep saying that the witness was there at the Inner Sanctum... ...if I can't prove it. The problem is, how am I going to do that?) Cross-Examination -- I Wasn't at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: I was never at the Inner Sanctum, I tell ya! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure you weren't there? Ihmus: All I'm sure of is that you're deeply skeptical! Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, are all lawyers always like this? Nahyuta: Most certainly. They always try to pin crimes on innocent witnesses, without any proof whatsoever. They are no better than bacteria or viruses. Ihmus: Yikes! You mean he's contagious?! He's gonna give me... lawyer-itis! Phoenix: (Okay, this is getting ridiculous.) Ihmus: Whew, that was a close one. He almost put me there at the scene of the crime when I wasn't even there! Ihmus: That much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You just said your memory was fuzzy! Ihmus: I sure did. What's the big deal? Phoenix: I'll tell you what! Your testimony isn't very credible if your memory of the events is fuzzy! Ihmus: Oh, no worries there. My memory may be fuzzy, but I'm very clear on one thing! Phoenix: (Here we go again...) Ihmus: If you asked me whether or not I remember what I did that night, I'd say I do! Judge: In short, you are confident that your testimony is true. ...Is that correct, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: Har har har har har! Exactly! Guess ya don't get to be a judge for nothing! So, in closing, I can clearly say that I was totally not there! Ihmus: Besides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Hmm... I wonder if it really was impossible for you to get to the Inner Sanctum...? Nahyuta: If you have something to say, just say it. Phoenix: Couldn't there have been another way to get there? A way that wouldn't attract attention? Ihmus: No, there isn't! Phoenix: (Which means, there is.) Judge: Perhaps the defense would share its theory with us. Phoenix: (I don't even have a wild guess, let alone a theory, though. Time to reach into my bag of bluffs!) To reach the Inner Sanctum without attracting any attention... He climbed up the cliff Phoenix: No one would've noticed if he had scaled up the side of the mountain. He could've snuck into the Inner Sanctum that way! Ihmus: Har har har har har! The cliff face is all loose and crumbly 'round there. Even a pro mountain climber couldn't have made it up that way! Nahyuta: Everyone here in Khura'in knows that. But let us forgive the defense's ignorance -- he is a foreigner, after all. Phoenix: W-Why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things?! Ihmus: Tough luck, lawyer! I couldn't have gotten up to the Inner Sanctum by scaling the cliff! Phoenix: Arrrgh! ...Please add that to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus. Adds statement \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" if not already added or changes statement from \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" or \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" to \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" He came from the plaza Phoenix: Maybe you snuck up to the Inner Sanctum via the stairs in the Plaza of Devotion? Ihmus: Har har har har har! With all those people at the plaza?! I don't think so! Phoenix: But they were all completely absorbed in prayer. With a little stealth, you could've slipped by without drawing any attention! Nahyuta: I am afraid that would have been impossible. During the rite... ...the gate to the stairs was locked tight from the Inner Sanctum side. Phoenix: Wh-What?! Ihmus: Yeah! If I'd tried to force the lock open... ...someone there woulda noticed, even if they were deep in prayer! Phoenix: Nngh! ...P-Please add that to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus. Adds statement \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" if not already added or changes statement from \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" or \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" to \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" He fell from the sky Phoenix: Maybe you fell from the sky? Ihmus: Har har har har har! The lawyer thinks he's a comedian now! Nahyuta: I was wondering what crazy theory you would propose next. Well, defense, let's hear it. Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus could've... um... parachuted down! We already know the weather was clear, and there was no wind to speak of. Perfect weather for skydiving, I'd say! Nahyuta: Now that you have been backed into a corner, your delusions grow ever more delusional. The Inner Sanctum is on a tiny ledge upon a sheer cliff over two thousand meters tall. (Changed from [The Inner Sanctum is on a tiny ledge upon a sheer cliff over 2,000 meters tall.] in the original release) One misstep, and a skydiver would soon find themself in the Twilight Realm. Ihmus: Yeah! I don't care how still the wind was. Even I couldn't have made that jump! Phoenix: Wait! What's this building on top of the sacred mountain...? Nahyuta: That is Royal Penitentiary No. 4. Phoenix: (Oh, right. Princess Rayfa mentioned there was a prison up there.) How do you get your prisoners up there anyway? Nahyuta: By helicopter. But only with authorization from the minister of justice. He is the only one who can approve flights that pass over the Inner Sanctum. Mountain Range Poster updated in the Court Record. Nahyuta: Might I also add, defense... ...that no parachute or any other equipment necessary for skydiving have been found. Ihmus: Are ya saying I flew down there by flapping my arms? I may be an incredible dude, but even I'm not capable of that! Phoenix: Arngh... Well, please add that statement to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus. Adds statement \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" if not already added or changes statement from \"No one could climb up those cliffs.

The rocks are all loose and crumbly! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You really couldn't climb your way up? Like, what if there was a route where the rock is more solid? Or maybe you're a celebrated rock climber. You know, something like that? Ihmus: As I said before, the rock's all loose and crumbly! And there's no route up there where the rock's more solid. Moreover, I've never rock climbed a day in my life! Judge: Any attempt to climb that mountain would be as good as throwing your life away. Phoenix: Aw, come on, Your Magistry... Judge: You continue to claim that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum. Yet said claim shall remain but a claim without any supporting evidence, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I realize that, Your Magistry. (If I can't find any inconsistencies, guess I can always try to elicit some more testimony.) Ihmus: The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who can verify that the gate was actually locked? I mean, what if it wasn't? Nahyuta: The high priest himself was seen locking it before the rite began. And we have many believers from the plaza who can corroborate this. Ihmus: Guess you struck out again, Mr. Lawyer Man! Phoenix: (What if there was a spare key to the gate? But I'm in no position to prove that, so... what now?) Judge: You continue to claim that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum. Yet said claim shall remain but a claim without any supporting evidence, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I realize that, Your Magistry. (If I can't find any inconsistencies, guess I can always try to elicit some more testimony.) Ihmus: It's not like I can fly through the air, either! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You wouldn't need to flap your arms if you had some gear. Nahyuta: As I have already stated... ...nothing of the sort was found in or around the scene of the crime. Ihmus: Har har har har har! I'd sure like to see some o' that so-called gear you're talking about! Phoenix: (I know, I know... But was there really nothing like that at the Inner Sanctum? What if there was something that could've been used as a parachute? I should give the evidence another look.) Judge: You continue to claim that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum. Yet said claim shall remain but a claim without any supporting evidence, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I realize that, Your Magistry. (If I can't find any inconsistencies, guess I can always try to elicit some more testimony.) Present Sanctum Prayer Flags Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Mr. Ihmus is right.\" Ihmus: Boy, you lawyers sure are scary! Press Phoenix: Now hold on. Lawyers aren't scary! Ihmus: But you're saying I was at the Inner Sanctum when I wasn't! Anyone who'd try to frame an innocent man like that is scary in my book! Gallery: LAWYERS ARE SCARY! LAWYERS ARE SCARY!IT'S A SETUP! IT'S DEFINITELY A SETUP! Phoenix: I'm not trying to set anyone up! I-I'm going to provide evidence and explain exactly how it was done. Nahyuta: The gallery speaks true. They know the depth of a lawyer's sin, and the poverty of his virtue. Phoenix: (There may be some bad apples, but we're not all like that, you know!) Maya: Don't worry, Nick! I'll still root for you, no matter how morally bankrupt you become! Phoenix: (Thanks a bunch, Maya...) Ihmus: Har har har har har! Phoenix: (Mr. Ihmus wasn't at the Inner Sanctum? Or more precisely, couldn't get there?) Maya: Hmm... I don't see a way out of this. Phoenix: Yeah, these kinds of debates only get worse if you argue them the wrong way. I'll have to pry some conclusive testimony out of him, and then present some evidence! Maya: Like when you're trying to catch frogs from a pond! Once you've got a grip on one, you'd better hold on tight! Phoenix: R-Right... Something like that. Phoenix: ...Mr. Ihmus is right. He couldn't have skydived down there without any gear. Ihmus: Well now, finally come around, have ya? Now you see that I couldn't have possibly been there at the Inner Sanctum! Phoenix: Right. ...If you didn't have any gear, that is. Ihmus: Wh-Wh-Whaaat on eaaaarth are you talking about?! Phoenix: (That overreaction is a dead giveaway that I'm on the right track!) Take a look at this piece of evidence! Judge: Those are prayer flags, are they not? Phoenix: Yes, but they have been sewn together... ...to create one big banner. A banner that could also function like a parachute! Nahyuta: Pohlkunka...! Phoenix: The people of Khura'in are so used to seeing prayer flags... ...that the police didn't even think twice about these flags during their investigation. Nahyuta: N-No, this cannot be! Phoenix: The witness landed at the Inner Sanctum by using these prayer flags as a parachute! Is that not right, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: There's no way out. I'm surrounded! Phoenix: Um... Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: All this talk's jogged my memory. I-I-I guess... I guess I WAS there at the Inner Sanctum after all! Nahyuta: Grrrrrr...! Phoenix: As I suspected, there WERE three people there that night! Maya: You did it, Nick! You weren't wrong, after all! Phoenix: Um, thanks? Mr. Ihmus. You were the one disguised as Lady Kee'ra that night, weren't you? Ihmus: Whaaa...?! N-No way, no how! Uhh... It's like this... Umm... Oh, yeah! I was only there at the Inner Sanctum by accident! Phoenix: By accident? Ihmus: Exactly! And that thing's not a parachute. It's a homemade paraglider! Phoenix: A paraglider? Are you telling me you could fly using that patchwork mess of material? Ihmus: It may not look like much, but it's as sturdy as can be! I rode the wind like an eagle, going higher and higher from my earthly launching point! But then something happened that forced me to land at the Inner Sanctum! Phoenix: So you just happened to land there? You expect me to believe that?! Judge: Now, now. Please calm yourself, Mr. Wright. However, the fact that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum is crucial testimony indeed. And it certainly warrants further explication. Therefore, let's continue with more testimony. Witness Testimony -- Why I Was at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: That evening, I was enjoying a trek through the night sky with my homemade paraglider. But just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened! An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum! As I landed, I banged my head, causing me to lose my memory! So you see, I ended up at the Inner Sanctum purely by accident! Nahyuta: Mr. Ihmus, you failed to mention any of this during your pre-trial questioning. Ihmus: Can't be helped! I mean, I'm just remembering it now! Nahyuta: Continue such slipshod testimony and you will be cast into the Hell of Hangnails... ...where you shall have hangnails grown and ripped out for eight hundred million years. (Changed from [...where you shall have hangnails grown and ripped out for 800 million years.] in the original release) Ihmus: HOO-HAAAAAAH! ...I think I'll pass on that! Phoenix: (Looks like that caught Prosecutor Sahdmadhi off-guard. This is my chance to rip his case to shreds!) Cross-Examination -- Why I Was at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: That evening, I was enjoying a trek through the night sky with my homemade paraglider. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were enjoying a trek through the night sky with your homemade paraglider? You didn't go to pray? Ihmus: A devout Khura'inist like me can pray anywhere -- even while flying through the sky! But I wouldn't recommend you try it. You're bound to end up dead! Har har har har har! Maya: A paraglider? I didn't see anything like that! Ihmus: That's 'cause o' the ritual curtain! It blocked your view! You shoulda seen me, majestically soaring between the mountains! Maya: R-Really? ...What do you think, Nick? Phoenix: D-Don't ask me. Ihmus: Har har har! I was really enjoying that flight! At first, anyway... Ihmus: But just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Something terrible happened? Ihmus: Exactly! And when I say terrible, I mean TERRIBLE! Phoenix: What? Was there something unexpected near Mt. Poniponi? Ihmus: Err... What was it again? Phoenix: ...Wait, you don't remember? Ihmus: Uhh... Let's just say it was terrible! Ihmus: An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What exactly was this \"accident\" you had? Ihmus: Good question. Now what was it again...? ...Wind? Oh yeah, it was the wind! And not just any wind, but a sudden gale force wind. Made me lose control. Phoenix: The wind was strong enough to make you lose control? Ihmus: Ya got that right. Phoenix: Okay, then. Please add that to your testimony. Changes statement from \"An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum!\" to \"Gale force winds came out of nowhere, so I made an emergency landing at the sanctum!\" Ihmus: Gale force winds came out of nowhere, so I made an emergency landing at the sanctum! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Had the wind been blowing the whole time around the mountains? Ihmus: Yep! Just the right amount o' wind for paragliding! So that sudden gale force wind was a real shocker! Phoenix: I see. So a decent wind had been blowing until then. Ihmus: Right! A paraglider's not much use without a decent wind! Present May 9th Newspaper Phoenix: Leads to: \"We have a saying in my country, Mr. Ihmus:\" Ihmus: As I landed, I banged my head, causing me to lose my memory! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where at the Inner Sanctum did you land? Ihmus: That's easy! Where the paraglider ended up! Phoenix: (I guess that makes sense. So, outside the ritual curtain, on the side where the moonlight shadows were cast.) Ihmus: But right as I landed, I hit my head on a rock! I lost both my consciousness and my memory! Haaar har har har har! Phoenix: (Something's seriously wrong with this guy.) Ihmus: So you see, I ended up at the Inner Sanctum purely by accident! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're lucky to be alive after an accident like that. Ihmus: Yeah, I'm just a lucky kinda guy! It's times like these that separate the men from the boys! Phoenix: Wow, I'd say you were incredibly lucky... Almost miraculously so. Ihmus: If ya got something to say, just say it! Phoenix: ...All right, Mr. Ihmus. It wasn't an accident, was it? You landed at the Inner Sanctum on purpose. Ihmus: Wh-What the--?! No, it was an accident, I'm telling ya! You don't even have any proof! So stop making things up about me! Phoenix: (His testimony's like a moving target!) Maya: Okay, Nick! Time for some evidence. You know, really grab him by the scruff of his neck! Phoenix: O-One thing at a time, Maya. First, I have to find an inconsistency. (But where there is constantly changing testimony... ...there are bound to be discrepancies and other issues!) Phoenix: We have a saying in my country, Mr. Ihmus: \"From one lie sprouts another.\" (Changed from ['One lie begets another.'] in the original release) Ihmus: Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: It means someone caught lying will lie again in an attempt to conceal their first lie. In other words, this current testimony is just a blatant lie you're telling to cover your tracks! Ihmus: What did you just say?! Phoenix: You claimed gale force winds caused you to lose control... ...but this newspaper has the weather report for the day of the murder. It says, \"The area around the Inner Sanctum will enjoy calm, clear skies today.\" Ihmus: P-P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa! Judge: Why, I do believe it does say that! Maya: \"From one lie sprouts another\"... That makes sense, but... (Chagned from [One lie begets another... That makes sense, but...] in the original release) Is it really a saying back home? I've never heard of it. Phoenix: Yeah... I kind of made that one up. Maya: For real? Phoenix: Your Magistry! The witness's testimony contains another flaw -- one that's even more fatal to his cause. Judge: More fatal, you say? The defense will explain himself at once! Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus claims he was flying up around the Inner Sanctum with his paraglider. But it would've been impossible to get all the way up there without any wind! Judge: Why, yes! I believe you're right! But we know the witness was at the Inner Sanctum, so... Mr. Ihmus! How did you get there?! And from where? Ihmus: ........................... Phoenix: (Without any wind, he couldn't have flown up there from the bottom of the mountain. By process of elimination... ...the only starting point that makes ANY sense is...!) Your Magistry, I believe I have the answer to your question. To reach the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here! Present Royal Penitentiary No. 4 Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hoo-hah! ...Are you insane?!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: This was his starting point! Nahyuta: Do you truly believe he arrived at the Inner Sanctum from there? Phoenix: Yes! Positive! Judge: Hmm... I fail to see how he could have reached the Inner Sanctum from there. Phoenix: (...Of course. What was I thinking?) Nahyuta: You are a fool. Such an answer is no better than what a monkey might offer. Judge: Now now, let us not be cruel. Even a monkey could point out a more probable location. Phoenix: (Great. Now the judge thinks I'm lower than a monkey.) Nahyuta: So, the lawyer was monkeying around when he claimed Mr. Ihmus flew down from above. Phoenix: No, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. The witness DID fly down from above. With that in mind... To get to the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here! Leads back to examination Ihmus: Hoo-hah! ...Are you insane?! Judge: Th-That's where he came from?! Phoenix: If he couldn't have come from below, the only other option is from above. So you see, A'nohn Ihmus came down from Royal Penitentiary No. 4! From there, he could have easily reached the Inner Sanctum by parachute! And that means he might have also killed the high priest! Judge: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus! Were you the third party at the Inner Sanctum?! And the one behind the warning to halt the rite that the victim received?! Was it you we saw in his final memory?! Are you the rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra?! Ihmus: HOOOOOOOOO-HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, sir! Help me out here! Nahyuta: .................. Maya: You did it! You finally left him speechless! Ihmus: Aw, c'mon, Mr. Prosecutor Man! Nahyuta: ...Quiet, you fool. You should use this time to prepare yourself for what is to come. For a fate far worse than Hangnail Hell awaits you now. Ihmus: ......... Nahyuta: Well done, defense. I must concede this point to you. The witness did, in fact, descend to the Inner Sanctum from Royal Penitentiary No. 4. Phoenix: (Huh? He didn't even put up a fight this time. That's awfully... generous of him.) Nahyuta: But if you are as perceptive as you seem, then surely you've already figured out the riddle. ...The riddle of A'nohn Ihmus's true identity. Phoenix: Oh, umm... (His true identity? Not sure I know quite yet, but I guess I'll have to answer with something...) Judge: ...It would seem I am the only one still in the dark here. Would the defense care to enlighten me? Who is this man we've been calling A'nohn Ihmus? Phoenix: The witness's true identity is... Present Wanted Poster Leads to: \"Is this really him?!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Hm? I fail to see how that shines any light on the matter. Nahyuta: That's because it doesn't. This piece of evidence has nothing to do with the witness's identity. Phoenix: I was just testing Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, to see if he really knew! Judge: ...It seems you are the clueless one here, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Couldn't bluff my way out of that one... Hmm... If he was at Royal Penitentiary No. 4 before he landed at the Inner Sanctum... ...then he must be...!) Judge: Unless you wish to be removed from this Hall of Justice, I suggest you think carefully. What is A'nohn Ihmus's true identity? Leads back to: \"The witness's true identity is...\" Phoenix: (Is this really him?!) Nahyuta: Hmph. Only now do you realize the truth. Well? Please do share with us your belated insight. Phoenix: Umm... Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Why are you holding back?! (Changed from [What's wrong, Nick? Just say it!] in the original release) Phoenix: Because this isn't going to be very helpful to our case... Maya: Really?! Are you sure? Phoenix: (Unfortunately, I've got no other choice.) That scruffy beard and shaggy mane completely threw me off. But it's all becoming clear now. The nighttime B.A.S.E. jump from the mountaintop prison... The precision landing at the Inner Sanctum using only a homemade parachute... Ihmus: ..................... Phoenix: Only a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is Datz Are'bal -- prison escapee and key member of Dhurke's rebel group! Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAAT?! Ihmus: GAAAH-HAAAAAAH! Judge: The witness is an escaped prisoner?! Nahyuta: Precisely. The police have been scouring every corner of the city to no avail. Meanwhile, here he was under our noses the entire time. Ihmus: Hoo-haaaaaaaaaaaah! Didn't think anyone would see through my clever disguise! Nahyuta: Heh heh heh. But the witness's charade is not all that has been shattered. ...Is it, defense? Phoenix: (Boy, do I hate this guy...) Nahyuta: Please recall the defense's own words... Phoenix: Whoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, \"Do not perform the rite.\" But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered. Judge: Who do you suppose sent that letter? Phoenix: A person with something to hide -- the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra herself! Nahyuta: He claimed that the real killer was \"the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra.\" Maya: Yeah, and what's your point?! Nahyuta: What of the witness's true identity? Phoenix: Only a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is Datz Are'bal -- prison escapee and key member of Dhurke's rebel group! Maya: *gasp* Oh no! Nahyuta: He is a rebel and an escaped prisoner. He could not possibly have been Lady Kee'ra, mortal enemy of the rebels! Maya: Nooooooooooo! Nahyuta: ...Now, perhaps the witness will enlighten us to the truth. After all, he has yet to refute any of this. Ihmus: Hoo-haaah! Ya got me! I'm the razor-sharp fangs of the Defiant Dragons! Datz: ...Datz Are'bal! Nahyuta: When did you get your memory back? Datz: Oh, around the time you guys were talking about there being no wind. But ya gotta gimme credit for making up all that testimony off the top o' my head! Phoenix: Are you prepared to tell us the truth now? Datz: Well, it's true I parachuted down to the Inner Sanctum...  ...but I banged my head on impact, and ended up unconscious outside the ritual curtain! In short, all my eyewitness testimony was a big fat lie. Phoenix: A big fat LIIIIIIEE?! Datz: Oh, and by the way! Long time no see... Yuty! Nahyuta: ......... Phoenix: (Wait... They know each other?) Nahyuta: Your Magistry. This filthy rebel belongs in a jail cell. Judge: Oh, yes! Of course! Bailiff, seize him at once! Datz: Seems ya really have forgotten the will of the dragon, huh, Yuty. But I haven't. And no dogs of the Ga'ran regime are gonna lay a finger on me! ...Alley-oop! Nahyuta: Deploy all available resources! I want all units placed on high alert! Judge: The escaped prisoner... escaped again. Nahyuta: The police force has been placed on high alert. He will be caught before long. Maya: An escaped prisoner who's escaped the law again after giving a ton of false testimony... Talk about a troublemaker. Phoenix: He really pulled a number on all of us. (What was the point of all that, anyway?) Judge: Well, I can't help but feel that entire episode was an enormous waste of time. Nahyuta: ...Your Magistry. Perhaps it was not as great of a waste as you might believe. Judge: What makes you say that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: Datz Are'bal dropped something as he made his escape from these halls. Phoenix: (Hm? That scrap of paper looks awfully familiar.) Nahyuta: These appear to be direct orders from Dhurke. Judge: From Dhurke?! The rebel leader?! Oh, but we only have a small corner of it... Phoenix: (Wait, I remember now...!) Your Magistry, I've seen that scrap of paper before! Judge: You have? Phoenix: The scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this. Present Bloodstained Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"And this is...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Take a look at this. This could be related to the scrap of paper Mr. Are'bal dropped. Judge: Really? Because I fail to see the connection. Phoenix: I suspected as much. Okay, on to the next piece of evidence. Judge: One moment, Mr. Wright! We move on when I say it's time to move on! Phoenix: Arngh, can't you let it slide once in a while? (I better carefully compare the scrap of paper Mr. Are'bal dropped to the evidence I have.) Judge: I will ask the defense once more. Where have you seen this scrap of paper before? Leads back to: \"The scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this.\" Judge: And this is...? Phoenix: I found it at the scene of the crime. It appears to be a copy of the order that Mr. Are'bal dropped. If we put the two together, we should be able to read what the order says! Judge: Oh, my! And just what does it say, Mr. Wright?! Phoenix: ..................... I can't read Khura'inese. Judge: Ah... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, if you please. Nahyuta: The ignorant lawyer has not bothered to learn our language? Very well, then... .............................. ...I do not understand. Phoenix: Well? Wh-What does it say?! Nahyuta: Using the lamplights as a landmark, he was to parachute down to the Inner Sanctum. Upon the rite's completion, he was to don Lady Kee'ra's robes and make his escape. Judge: What?! That is how he was to escape from prison?! Phoenix: (So, if I were to assume that Mr. Are'bal was the one who killed the high priest... ...then maybe it was because Abbot Inmee tried to thwart his escape plan...?) Nahyuta: O foul lawyer... I'm afraid that is simply ludicrous. Phoenix: Huh? B-But I didn't say anything. (D-Did he just read my mind?) Nahyuta: I know how your putrid mind works. Unfortunately for you, however, now that the rebel's escape plan has been revealed... ...it is clear that Datz Are'bal is not the high priest's killer. Phoenix: H-How can you be so sure?! Nahyuta: If only you would use that putrid brain of yours every once in a while. Datz Are'bal's plan could not have worked without the help of a certain individual. Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean? Nahyuta: I am speaking of Abbot Inmee, of course. Had Datz Are'bal simply donned Lady Kee'ra's robes and made his escape alone... ...he would have been far too conspicuous. But were he by the high priest's side... ...the faithful citizens praying in the plaza would have had no cause to suspect anything. It is, therefore, unthinkable that Datz Are'bal was the high priest's killer! Phoenix: AUGH! Judge: S-So then, you're saying...! The high priest was a...?! Oh, I cannot bear to say it! Nahyuta: I am afraid it is so. He numbered among the rebels who threaten our kingdom. Judge: How could this be?! Gallery: ...The high priest... a rebel?Th-There must be some kind of mistake! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: ...Let it go, and move on. Accept the truth. It is the only way. And that goes double for you, defense. Cease your futile battle now. Phoenix: And why should I? Nahyuta: Because I will now put the final nail in the coffin of the accused. Now that we have eliminated Datz Are'bal from our list of suspects... ...there is only one person that still remains: the accused, Maya Fey. Phoenix: Phoenix: Hold it right there! Aren't you forgetting something important? Judge: Something... important? Please do explain, defense. Phoenix: We can't end this trial without looking into... The arrow Phoenix: What about the arrow that was fired into the high priest's house?! Nahyuta: It was simply a means to deliver the warning letter to the victim. Phoenix: (Hmm...That's more or less the same conclusion we came to yesterday...) You know... I guess you're right. Judge: Oh? Then THIS should be just about right as well! It seems there is no need to continue this trial any longer. Phoenix: No, Your Magistry. There is still something important that must be brought to light! Leads back to: \"We can't end this trial without looking into...\" The murder weapon Phoenix: What about the murder weapon?! We haven't found it yet! Nahyuta: What does it matter if it has been found or not? The fact remains that the victim was killed with it by the accused. Judge: I also fail to see how that would be important, Mr. Wright. This, however, is. It seems there is no need to continue this trial any longer. Phoenix: No, Your Magistry. There is still something important that must be brought to light! Leads back to: \"We can't end this trial without looking into...\" The third party Leads to: \"I'm talking about the true identity of the Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance vision! Phoenix: I'm talking about the true identity of the Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance vision! If that wasn't Datz Are'bal, then who was it?! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: That matter has already been resolved. Phoenix: It has? (What's he talking about?) Nahyuta: It is as I have maintained from the start. There was no third party in the S\u00e9ance vision. Phoenix: Phoenix: B-But there was another Lady Kee'ra there besides Maya Fey! We all saw her! Nahyuta: Phoenix: (Wh-What the--?! I... I can't do my finger point!) Nahyuta: Hrnh! Phoenix: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Nahyuta: ...It is time to let it go, and move on. Your fate has already been sealed, much like your arm. Phoenix: (Th-This hardly seems fair.) Nahyuta: It is quite simple once you consider where the victim and the accused were at the time. If the victim was near the spring with his back to the accused, what would he see ahead? Judge: Besides the water itself... there is nothing but the warbaa'd statue. Nahyuta: Precisely. The Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance is the warbaa'd statue draped in her sacred robes! Phoenix: N-NOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAY! Nahyuta: The accused wanted the false Lady Kee'ra to appear in the S\u00e9ance vision... ...before she came from behind and stabbed the victim with the dagger in a reverse grip. Judge: But why would the accused want to do something like create a false Lady Kee'ra? Nahyuta: To show it to the victim as he was being slain. Judge: And what reason would the accused have to fool the victim she was about to kill? Nahyuta: It was not the victim she was trying to fool. ...It was this very court itself. Judge: Come again? Nahyuta: Suspicion would not fall on the accused if it looked as if another Lady Kee'ra was there. And the defense was foolish enough to fall for it and claim it was a third party in disguise. Judge: Are... Are you saying...?! Nahyuta: I am. It was all a cleverly wicked scheme, perpetrated by the accused. A scheme in which she sought to use the S\u00e9ance vision to mislead us! Phoenix: (This can't be happening!) Nahyuta: What a face you are making, defense. I am surprised you are taking this so hard. After all, did I not clearly state a while back... ...that you were chasing after naught but a deluded fantasy? Nahyuta: Heh heh heh... Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a deluded fantasy. Phoenix: (You're telling me he knew this is how it would turn out all the way back then...? And that he was just waiting for the most effective moment to spring it on me?!) Nahyuta: Heh heh heh. Do you understand now? I have had you dancing in the palm of my hand this entire time. Phoenix: It... It can't be--! Judge: This is an outrage! You took our royal priestess's sacred Divination S\u00e9ance... ...and used it to commit this most foul and despicable murder?! Maya: N-No! I did nothing of the sort! Phoenix: (Maya...) Maya: Nick! It's not true! I... I didn't...! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Cease this ugly display. Your fate is sealed now that the facts have been exposed. Your Magistry. The time has come to convict this criminal who only seeks to taint this sacred hall. Judge: Indeed. It seems this trial is over. Phoenix: Judge: Does the defense wish to offer up yet another counterargument or something? Phoenix: Umm... The accused is... uhh... is not the killer! And uh... here's why... (Now what do I do!? I've got nothing!) Judge: It would appear that the defense has run out of arguments to make. Phoenix: (I thought for sure that that rebel was the killer! The only person with a possible motive -- the one dressed as Lady Kee'ra -- has vanished. And I've got nothing to use against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's argument! Damn it! I can't lose now! Not like this!) Judge: Very well then, I shall now render my verdict. Phoenix: W-Wait! Please, wait! I'm begging you! Nahyuta: It is time to let it go, and move on. Judge: This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... Guilty Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Bailiff: Your Magistry! Please forgive the interruption, but... Judge: What is the meaning of this?! Bailiff: A body has been found in the Plaza of Devotion, Your Magistry! Nahyuta: ...What's this? Phoenix: (A body? What happened now?) Bailiff: And we found this sticking out of the victim. Judge: Wh-Why that's... Lady Kee'ra's Warbaa'd Dagger! Gallery: Lady Kee'ra! She has returned from the Twilight Realm once more!She has come to defeat the rebels! Judge: Peace! Nahyuta: Well, it would seem the dagger that was once lost has now been found. Bailiff: I have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: Yes? Bailiff: This dagger... It bears the fingerprints of Maya Fey on it! Phoenix: WHA-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Maya: B-But... Phoenix: (Why would Maya's prints be on it?) Nahyuta: .............................. I cannot believe it, yet it must be true... Judge: Is something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: This trial has run its course, and the accused's guilt has been firmly established. However... ...it would seem the defense was right about one thing. Phoenix: I-I was? Nahyuta: You claimed that the murder at the Inner Sanctum... ...had been carried out by the rebel hunter masquerading as Lady Kee'ra. Phoenix: I did say something to that effect, but what of it? Judge: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! A-Are you suggesting what I think you are? Nahyuta: I believe the true identity of the rebel hunter who has been masquerading as Lady Kee'ra... ...is none other than the accused, Ms. Maya Fey! Phoenix: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat?! Maya: Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?! Judge: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Nahyuta: I realize how shocking this must seem. Looking back, however, I now realize there was much that pointed to this fact. The rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra was first sighted about two years ago. And the accused first came to our kingdom two years ago as well. Judge: Wh-Why, the timing matches perfectly! Nahyuta: But there is more... That warning letter was found in the high priest's bedroom three days before the rite. Despite his house being locked up tight that night. Phoenix: Phoenix: How does that prove anything?! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: It is difficult to believe an intruder could have found a way to enter such a secure house. However, the accused was known to come and go freely there. ...Mainly to prepare for the Purification Rite. Phoenix: Ah! Maya: Abbot Inmee was an important figure with a ton of duties, including training acolytes. He was really kind, even to a foreigner like me. He even invited me over to his house whenever I was between training sessions. Nahyuta: The accused could have easily left the house unlocked for herself without anyone noticing. Phoenix: Nooooooooooooooo! Lady Kee'ra's Warning updated in the Court Record. Nahyuta: If we assume that the accused was Lady Kee'ra... ...that more than establishes her motive for killing the high priest. Judge: Yes, the victim was secretly an insurgent, bent on helping Datz Are'bal escape, after all. Nahyuta: Precisely. That made him a target of Lady Kee'ra's wrath. And after killing the high priest, she then unleashed her divine justice on another rebel. So, it seems the scope of this case has expanded. We now have... two murders perpetrated by Ms. Maya Fey, masquerading as Lady Kee'ra. Judge: .................. If Ms. Fey is indeed a serial killer, it would affect the severity of her punishment. In light of this, I believe this second murder must be investigated before we can proceed. Nahyuta: As you wish, Your Magistry. Maya Fey, I hereby charge you with this second murder. May your defiled soul feel the weight of your sins. Phoenix: (A new murder charge on top of a guilty verdict?) Judge: It seems the defense will live to see one more day. Phoenix: (Talk about \"hanging on by a thread\"...) Nahyuta: Heh heh heh. Come tomorrow, a far more terrible punishment awaits you. Judge: I hereby suspend these proceedings so that the second murder may be investigated. Until the conclusion of this new investigation, this court is adjourned! To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: That statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence. Nahyuta: Let it go, and move on. Abandon this folly. You know very well your evidence proves nothing. Phoenix: Nice try, but you can't make me give up. I'm going to prove I'm right! Judge: You can point your finger as much as you want, but you're simply wasting your time. It is a pitiful sight to see a lawyer who doesn't know when he is beat. Phoenix: (Argh... I just need to hang in there a little longer.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Anything come to mind? Nahyuta: ............ Judge: ............ Phoenix: W-Well...? Judge: Hm? Did the defense have something he would like to say? Phoenix: (That fell on deaf ears.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Judge: Is something the matter? Phoenix: Sorry. That scream just sort of slipped out. Judge: I don't know about trials in your country, but we refrain from such rash outbursts here. Perhaps this will deter any future urges you might have. Phoenix: (I'm not helping my case in the judge's eyes, both literally and figuratively.) Presenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination S\u00e9ance (on initial Insight) Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision? Rayfa: Inconsistent...? I think not! Phoenix: Exactly! That's where the inconsistency lies! Judge: No, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies. Phoenix: (Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...) Maya: Hmm... Phoenix: What is it, Maya? Maya: I'm... still trying to figure this whole Insight thing out. When the words change size... ...that means the intensity of those sensations is changing, too, right? Phoenix: That's what it looks like to me. Maya: So then... that's probably something we should keep an eye on, too. In short, we should be on the lookout for... ...changes that shouldn't take place, but they do anyway... ...and changes that don't occur when they should. Phoenix: How very perceptive of you. (I guess all that training's sharpened Maya's mind along with her powers.) Phoenix: Let's compare the vision to the Insights, while looking for changes in sensory intensity! Maya: Sounds like a plan! Presenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination S\u00e9ance (on all revised Insights) Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision? Rayfa: Inconsistent...? I think not! Phoenix: Exactly! That's where the inconsistency lies! Judge: No, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies. Phoenix: (Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...) Consult (during a cross-examination, when evidence must be presented) Maya: Looks like you can't count on your bluffing skills to save your butt this time. Phoenix: Yeah... This is a tough one. Maya: Well, to me, there's something about this one statement that seems off. Phoenix: Yeah, it does sound a little strange, doesn't it? Thanks, Maya. I'll take another look at the evidence. Maya: You can always count on me! Consult (during a cross-examination, when statements must be pressed) Maya: You're looking a little pale there, Nick. Are you all right? Phoenix: This trial is really putting me through the wringer. Maya: Maybe it's just a matter of getting the information you need. Phoenix: Right... Thanks, Maya. (Guess I'd better keep pressing, then!) Maya: Once you get more info, you can use it to make one of your famous bluffs! Phoenix: (She makes it sound like bluffing is my default move.) Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on initial Insight) Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Phoenix: Um, I'm having a tough time spotting a contradiction. Maya: Well, there was one sensation that caught my eye. You know that footsteps sensation? Didn't something about it seem strange to you? Phoenix: Now that you mention it... Thanks. I'll focus on that as I review the Insights. Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on first revised Insight) Maya: You're making that \"I-can't-find-a-contradiction\" face of yours again, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah, well... I'm kinda clutching at straws here. Maya: And I think we should focus on the sound of bells that were just uncovered. Phoenix: You're right. Let's focus on that sensation and take another look at Rayfa's Insights. Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on second revised Insight) Maya: You look like you're having a tough time, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah, because I can't find any contradictions. I mean, the sensations in the vision all seem perfectly fine to me... Maya: In that case, why don't you read the Insights while focusing on what the victim saw? Phoenix: (Of course! His sense of sight! Time to go over those Insights again!) Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on third revised Insight) Phoenix: Maya... I can't find any contradictions. Maya: Come on, Nick. A bit early to throw in the towel, don't you think? Phoenix: But I didn't notice anything wrong with the sensations that appeared as words just now. Maya: Well then, maybe the contradiction is in what Abbot Inmee saw. I think there's something fishy about the things that we can more clearly see now. Also... We should focus on not only the sensations, but the updated Insights, as well. Phoenix: Right. Thanks, Maya! Too many penalties Judge: This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... Guilty The Rite of Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 11, 1:03 PMTehm'pul Temple Phoenix: (What do I do now...? I can't believe Maya and I were actually found guilty...) Judge: This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey...  ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... Guilty Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Ahlbi: M-M-M-Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ahlbi! Ahlbi: I saw the whole trial! What's going to happen to Miss Maya now? Phoenix: ...I'm worried about that, too. But right now... Bailiff: I have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: Yes? Bailiff: This dagger... It bears the fingerprints of Maya Fey on it! Phoenix: Right now, I need to focus on the next trial. Ahlbi: The murder of Acolyte Zeh'lot, right? Phoenix: At least the jury is still out on that one, so to speak. (The two murders are most likely connected. If I can get to the bottom of Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder... ...it might give me the ammunition I need to overturn Maya's guilty verdict.) Ahlbi: Let me help you investigate! I want to assist you any way I can! Phoenix: I appreciate it, Ahlbi, but we're talking about a murder. Ahlbi: Yeah, but it's going to be hard for a foreigner to investigate this on his own! Phoenix: You have a point there. Phoenix: (Hmm... I wish I knew what to do.) Rayfa: ..................... Phoenix: (Hm? Isn't that...?) ...Your Benevolence. Rayfa: ............... Phoenix: Um, Princess Rayfa? Rayfa: Hm? ...Oh, it is you again. ...The dead lawyer walking, guilty of abetting a murderer under the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: Urk! (I see she hasn't lost any of her charm.) Rayfa: ........................... Phoenix: Why the long face? I thought you'd be glad I was found guilty under the DC Act. Rayfa: ...Hmph. I am in no mood to take joy in your suffering. For I was unable to defeat you, and had to leave the job to others. I failed in my sacred duty as the royal priestess. Phoenix: I guess that answers my question.) Rayfa: Have I misunderstood... the voice of the mitamah... yet again? ...Th-This--! This cannot be! Rayfa: .................. Phoenix: (All I did was defend my client... Nngh... I can't bear to see her looking so sad like this, though...) ...Your Benevolence. Rayfa: .................. Phoenix: Your Benevolence! Rayfa: Hm? Oh, Barbed Head. I thought you had already begun your journey to the Twilight Realm. Phoenix: I'm not dead yet! I still have an investigation to do... for tomorrow's trial. Rayfa: What's this?! D-Do you mean to say... ...you have not given up yet? Phoenix: That's right. I'm going to prove Maya innocent tomorrow. Rayfa: ............ But why? Why do you refuse to give up? I cannot fathom such obstinacy. Investigate all you want -- I care not! Phoenix: ...You really don't mind? But aren't you worried that a lawyer backed into a corner by the DC Act... ...might do something desperate, like forge evidence? Rayfa: What's this?! Phoenix: If left unsupervised, I'd be free to do whatever I wanted, you know. Rayfa: ............Grrr! Phoenix: (Okay, now to see if she takes the bait.) Rayfa: Yes... I see your point. Barbed Head... Phoenix: Yes? Rayfa: I know what happened yesterday. You perpetrated some sort of fraud or other misdeed while I was not watching! Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: That explains why I misunderstood the voice of the high priest's soul! Yes, of course! That is the only explanation! Phoenix: ............ (I was just trying to cheer her up. Now she thinks even less of me.) Rayfa: I must not allow you to sully our sacred Hall of Justice with your misdeeds ever again. Therefore, today, I will be monitoring your every move once more! I will not fail to spot your misdeeds this time! The moment I see anything out of the ordinary, I will send you straight to prison. And you, boy. Do not throw your lot in with this foreign devil. Ahlbi: ...B-But... Your Benevolence! Phoenix: It's okay, Ahlbi. You don't need to worry about me. I'll be back before you know it. (But first, I should probably lighten my load a bit.) Ahlbi, would you mind holding on to some evidence for me? Ahlbi: Of course not! I'm always glad to help! Unnecessary evidence unloaded onto Ahlbi. Ahlbi: May the Holy Mother's blessings be upon you! Phoenix: (Now then... The scene of the crime is the logical place to start. If I recall correctly, the body was found at the Plaza of Devotion.) Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: That boy has grown far too close to you. He will require re-education if he persists in befriending lawyers. Phoenix: Re-education? What exactly does that entail? Rayfa: First, he must meditate upon Lady Kee'ra for forty-eight hours in the prayer pose. Phoenix: How is that re-education? It sounds more like torture to me. What to do Rayfa: Barbed Head! You have an investigation to conduct, do you not?! Get on with it! Phoenix: Y-Yes, but... (Why does she always have to be like this?) Rayfa: What? Would you have preferred that tour guide boy tag along instead? Phoenix: Huh?! Oh, umm... Rayfa: Hmph, it would appear I have read your mind most accurately. Phoenix: (That smile of hers is downright scary.) Bazaar Examine Warbaa'd RAWWWRRR! Phoenix: Aaaaaaah! What the heck was that?! Rayfa: Honestly, what sort of grown man jumps at the call of a warbaa'd? Phoenix: What? That roar came from this bird? ...I-It is a bird, right? Rayfa: W-Well... give me a moment! ...Nayna! The warbaa'd has many natural enemies. Therefore, it mimics a lion's roar in order to scare them away. But you did not know that, did you? And you call yourself a lawyer! Hmph! Phoenix: You didn't know, either, until you asked Nayna. Rayfa: Enough! You... You... lamebrain! Yak Rayfa: Have you never seen a yak before, Barbed Head? Phoenix: Only in zoos. Rayfa: Well in Khura'in, they play an important part in our daily lives. Therefore, they must be treated with kindness and with respect. MOOOOOOOOO! Rayfa: H-Hey! What are doing?! I command you to cease that at once! Phoenix: (Wow... That yak is really licking and nuzzling the daylights out of Rayfa...) Rayfa: Foul beast! You have made a mess of my royal raiment! For that, I shall make a leather coat out of you later! Phoenix: What was that about treating them with \"kindness and respect\" again...? Produce cart Rayfa: Why, this giah'pam looks positively delicious. I think I shall take this one. Phoenix: Y-Your Benevolence! You can't just take things without paying! Rayfa: Shopkeeper! You will receive your payment from this barb-headed foreigner. Lady: Thank you, barb-headed foreigner. Phoenix: Peasants paying for princesses? This place is absolutely feudal. Poster Phoenix: (It's a poster... That's the Plumed Punisher, Khura'in's famous action hero. I guess we're not the only country with superheroes like that.) Steaming buns Rayfa: ........................ *groooowl*... Phoenix: ...Was that your stomach? Rayfa: N-No! Th-That was not me! *groooowl*... Rayfa: Th-That... was the cry of the warbaa'd! Phoenix: Would you like a magatah'man? Rayfa: Enough! I am not hungry! Phoenix: (Why can't some people just admit when they're hungry?) May 11Plaza of Devotion Phoenix: Looks like the police already finished their investigation. (To think someone would be killed here --  a place devoted to prayer. A body outline and... flowers? Did someone leave them here in memory of the deceased? Hm? And there's something different about the prayer flags today...) Rayfa: As the high priest's disciple, Acolyte Zeh'lot was utterly devoted to his training. First the high priest, and now his devoted disciple... Maya Fey will pay for this! Phoenix: As I keep trying to tell you, Maya has nothing to do with any of this! Rayfa: And you can prove this... how?! Phoenix: What do you think I'm doing here?! Gathering dirt and dust for the trial?! Rayfa: You and your smart mouth! This is precisely why you and your lawyerly ilk are so reviled. ???: Hey, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ema! Rayfa: It's that detective from your country again... Ema: Eep, it's the princess! Rayfa: You seem displeased that I am here. Ema: Oh, n-no, no! Don't be silly! Mr. Wright? I'm, uhh... I'm so sorry about what happened to Maya. Phoenix: It's not your fault, Ema. You were just doing your job. And if I had just done mine... Ema: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: ...But it's no use crying over spilled milk! Would you mind telling me what you know about the murder? It's do or die in court tomorrow. And I mean that literally. Ema: Gladly. I'll help in any way I can! Rayfa: Remember, I have my eyes on the both of you, so see to it that you commit no misdeeds. Ema: Of course not! Hmph, you're talking to a professional here. Examine Body outline Phoenix: Acolyte Zeh'lot died bent over in prayer. There's no trace of blood on the ground, though... The fact that there's so little bleeding could mean it was a single stab to a vital point. ...Not that that would've been very difficult, considering the position he was in. Prayer rug Phoenix: Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed in a prayer pose. With his head bent over like that, the last thing he saw must've been this rug. Rayfa: It is a prayer rug woven by devout monks. May the Holy Mother's blessing be upon his departed soul. Phoenix: It's strange that there are no bloodstains, though... Rayfa: Hmm... Perhaps it was so cold, his blood froze. Or perhaps it was absorbed by his vestment. Phoenix: (It IS pretty cold. Maybe the blood really did just freeze inside his body.) Flowers Phoenix: So these flowers were left here in memory of Acolyte Zeh'lot? What are they called? Rayfa: They are known as nahmanda, and they are given to express sorrow when a life is lost. Phoenix: It seems offering flowers in memory of the dead is a universal practice. Nahmanda Flower added to the Court Record. Flowers (subsequent times) Phoenix: So these flowers were left here in memory of Acolyte Zeh'lot? What are they called? Rayfa: They are known as nahmanda, and they are given to express sorrow when a life is lost. Phoenix: It seems offering flowers in memory of the dead is a universal practice. Purple prayer flag Phoenix: This prayer flag looks much newer than the rest. Umm, Your Benevolence? What does it say here? Rayfa: The dearest wishes of our subjects are written upon these prayer flags. Reading the prayers of others is considered rude, but if you must know... ...it says, \"At the usual spot. Bring grub. The key, too.\" Hmm, that is one of the more direct and practical prayers I have ever seen. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it's even a prayer. Brand New Flag added to the Court Record. Purple prayer flag (subsequent times) Phoenix: This prayer flag looks much newer than the rest. Umm, Your Benevolence? What does it say here? Rayfa: The dearest wishes of our subjects are written upon these prayer flags. Reading the prayers of others is considered rude, but if you must know... ...it says, \"At the usual spot. Bring grub. The key, too.\" Hmm, that is one of the more direct and practical prayers I have ever seen. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it's even a prayer. Talk The incident Phoenix: Let's see... How about starting with an overview of what happened. Ema: Sure. The victim is Puhray Zeh'lot. He was the high priest's disciple. His body was discovered around noon today... ...right after the rite wrapped up. Phoenix: So, during the high priest's murder trial. Ema: That's right. Apparently, he had been here praying since the day before the rite even started. Talk about serious devotion. Phoenix: (Yeah... I barely lasted a few minutes.) Ema: This is a picture of Mr. Zeh'lot's body. Phoenix: (That dagger in his upper back looks like it would've been particularly painful. Hm? Is that a tattoo on the back of his neck? It's... peach shaped...?) Ema: Everyone started leaving when the praying was finally done... ...but the victim remained bent over in prayer. And when they went over to check on him... Phoenix: They discovered he was dead, right? Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) added to the Court Record. Ema: Yes. The estimated time of death is May 9, sometime between... ...the start of the rite and the discovery of the high priest's body. In other words, we believe the crime took place during the Purification Rite. And the murder weapon was the same ceremonial dagger that killed the high priest. The prosecution believes Maya came down the stairs after killing the high priest... ...and then stabbed Mr. Zeh'lot with the same dagger. Phoenix: (Circumstantial evidence does point to Maya, but...) What about the cause of death? Ema: He apparently died instantly from the dagger that was left thrust into his upper back. Here's the autopsy report. Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Rayfa: Estimated time of death, you say? How can you know such a thing? I want to know! ...Well, Barbed Head! Out with it! Ema: Oh, so the princess of the spirit medium kingdom is interested in forensic science? Rayfa: Hmph! I have no interest is science, forensic or otherwise! Nevertheless, I will someday be queen. As such, it would be wise to know what silly things the common folk believe in. Ema: Tsk! There's nothing silly about it! I'll have you know, even Prosecutor Sahdmadhi holds forensics in high regard. Rayfa: Does he?! Hmm... Perhaps I should not underestimate the power of science. Still, I suppose it is nothing much compared to the Divination S\u00e9ance. Ema: She really doesn't have an adorable bone in her body. Phoenix: Ema, I think she's actually interested. Would you mind explaining it to her? Ema: ...I guess I have to now. ...Okay, there are many ways to estimate the time of death... ...but the most well-known method uses the change in body temperature. Rayfa: Interesting... Ema: Body temperature drops at a steady rate from the moment a person dies. That means we can tell how long someone's been dead by measuring their temperature. Rayfa: Hmm... I see, I see! That was quite enlightening. Barbed Head! Present your forehead now! Phoenix: What? Why? Rayfa: Hmm... You feel just a little over ninety-five degrees. It seems you are not dead yet. Phoenix: Of course I'm not! Rayfa: Heh heh. It was but a jest. After all, you're still the dead lawyer walking. Phoenix: (I fail to see the humor in any of this.) Were there any witnesses? With so many people here at the plaza, you'd think somebody would've seen something. Ema: You'd think so, wouldn't you? But we haven't found a single witness. Phoenix: How's that even possible?! Rayfa: Because everyone was bent over, utterly devoted to prayer, naturally. Phoenix: Oh, right, the back-shattering pose that nearly killed me. Still, you'd think someone would've noticed something. Ema: I thought so too, but... ...with the monk's scarf he had on, no one could see the dagger in his upper back. Plus, everyone was so absorbed in prayer, they didn't see or hear anything. Phoenix: I can't believe this. Rayfa: What you choose to believe is your choice, but the fact remains there were no witnesses. However, there is one piece of irrefutable evidence. ...The dagger. Ema: Sadly, yes... Phoenix: Argh... The incident (subsequent times) Phoenix: Let's see... How about starting with an overview of what happened. Ema: Sure. The victim is Puhray Zeh'lot. He was the high priest's disciple. His body was discovered around noon today... ...right after the rite wrapped up. Phoenix: So, during the high priest's murder trial. Ema: That's right.

Rayfa: Because everyone was bent over, utterly devoted to prayer, naturally. Phoenix: Oh, right, the back-shattering pose that nearly killed me. Still, you'd think someone would've noticed something. Ema: I thought so too, but... ...with the monk's scarf he had on, no one could see the dagger in his upper back. Plus, everyone was so absorbed in prayer, they didn't see or hear anything. Phoenix: I can't believe this. Rayfa: What you choose to believe is your choice, but the fact remains there were no witnesses. However, there is one piece of irrefutable evidence. ...The dagger. Ema: Sadly, yes... Phoenix: Argh... Murder weapon (appears after \"The incident\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about the murder weapon? Ema: The killer used the Warbaa'd Dagger, the legendary weapon of Lady Kee'ra. It was discovered impaled in the victim's upper back. Rayfa: The accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger, were they not? Ema: Y-Yes, they were. Warbaa'd Dagger added to the Court Record. Rayfa: With such irrefutable evidence, there is no questioning the accused's guilt. Phoenix: Not so fast. What about a motive? Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot. Rayfa: What do the police think about this matter? Murder weapon (subsequent times) Phoenix: Could you tell me about the murder weapon? Ema: The killer used the Warbaa'd Dagger, the legendary weapon of Lady Kee'ra. It was discovered impaled in the victim's upper back. Rayfa: The accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger, were they not? Ema: Y-Yes, they were. Rayfa: With such irrefutable evidence, there is no questioning the accused's guilt. Phoenix: Not so fast. What about a motive? Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot. Rayfa: What do the police think about this matter? Motive (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot! Rayfa: So you say, but let us now hear what the police think about the matter. Ema: The police believe Maya is the Lady Kee'ra figure who has been battling the rebels. And since Mr. Zeh'lot was the disciple of the high priest, who turned out to be a rebel... Rayfa: He, too, was likely a rebel, and therefore met the same untimely demise as his teacher. Ema: ...Yes, that is how the police currently view this crime. Phoenix: There's no way Maya is that Lady Kee'ra vigilante! Ema: I agree on a personal level, but the police are just going with what today's trial concluded. Phoenix: Ngrk! (I really blew it in court today.) Present Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report Ema: Based on the estimated time of death, we believe he was killed during the rite itself. It appears he was stabbed in the upper back with a dagger and died instantly. Phoenix: But there were so many people here. How could no one have noticed? Ema: I know. I can't believe it, either. I guess they were just that focused on their prayers or something. Warbaa'd Dagger Ema: Maya's fingerprints were found on the dagger that was used in the murder. The police are, therefore, investigating her as their prime suspect. Rayfa: The evidence is irrefutable, with no room for argument. Ema: I really don't want to treat Maya as a suspect, but... ...based on the evidence and police reports I've received so far, it's not looking good. Phoenix: (Not good? More like, how could it get any worse?) After clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag: Phoenix: Okay... That message on the prayer flag seems a little weird, but... Before clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House Phoenix: ...I think I've seen everything there is to see around here. Rayfa: You have not found or heard anything of particular worth. Are you ready to give up? Phoenix: No, I'm not calling it quits yet! Ema: ...D-Does it look like you have any hope of winning, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ema... I can't really say at this point. All I know is I have to keep investigating. Rayfa: What are you two sneaks up to? I would advise you to get back to work if you are done here, Detective. Otherwise, I will report you to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi for dereliction of duty. Ema: I-I-I, I'm going, I'm going! Well, see you later, Mr. Wright. And good luck! Phoenix: (I should really pay a visit to everyone and every place connected with this case.) After clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House Phoenix: ...I'm not sure it's related to this case. Rayfa: We have paid a visit to all of the people and places connected with this case. I think it is about time you prepared yourself for the inevitable. Don't you? Ema: ...D-Does it look like you have any hope of winning, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ema... I can't really say at this point. All I know is I have to keep investigating. Rayfa: What are you two sneaks up to? I would advise you to get back to work if you are done here, Detective. Otherwise, I will report you to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi for dereliction of duty. Ema: I-I-I, I'm going, I'm going! Well, see you later, Mr. Wright. And good luck! Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Is it not time to give up? Phoenix: No, there is still someone I need to talk to first. May 11High Priest's House Phoenix: Hello. I'm sorry to bother you again, but... Beh'leeb: Oh, it's you. Rayfa: Barbed Head! You are not contemplating casting suspicion upon Lady Beh'leeb, are you? She lost her beloved husband, and now Acolyte Zeh'lot, who was like a son to her. Phoenix: Of course, I'm not. But since she was close to both victims, I wanted to hear what she has to say. Rayfa: ...Very well. Phoenix: (And then there's the fact that Lady Kee'ra didn't attack Mrs. Inmee. That probably means she isn't a rebel.) Beh'leeb: Is this about poor Puhray? Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think I can talk about that right now. Phoenix: ...B-But what about Maya? She's innocent. Beh'leeb: Maya? I heard she was found guilty. First, my dear husband, and now Puhray? Phoenix: Mrs. Inmee, you don't really believe that Maya is the killer, do you? Beh'leeb: I-I... I don't know. But that was the verdict, so what else can I believe? What am I to do? Phoenix: The verdict was already reached in your husband's case... ...but the truth of the matter is yet to be found! Beh'leeb: How can you be so sure? Phoenix: ...Because I believe that Maya is innocent. That is all I have right now -- my faith in her. So please. Help me understand what happened. Beh'leeb: So you're... you're defending her based solely on faith? Even though you'll be punished for abetting the accused? Phoenix: That's right. Beh'leeb: ...A-All right, then. Your faith has moved me. I will tell you what I can. Rayfa: A-Are you sure about this, Lady Beh'leeb? Beh'leeb: \"My lovely wife is also a devout follower of Khura'inism. As such, she is not one to make light of another's faith. But if I find that you have lied about your faith in Maya Fey's innocence... ...I shall curse your entire family and all your disciples for the next eight generations.\" Phoenix: (Hey! Leave Athena and Apollo alone, buddy!) Examine Photo frame near TV Phoenix: A photo of the high priest, his wife, Acolyte Zeh'lot, and Maya... Since Maya's in it... ...it must've been taken the day before the rite. I should ask Mrs. Inmee about it. Family Photo added to the Court Record. Rayfa: To think that this would be their final family photo... That no-good Maya Fey has some nerve. I mean, here she is posing with the two men whom she would soon kill. Phoenix: I beg to differ. I see this photo as proof that she didn't kill them. Rayfa: Hmph. That smile of hers does not fool me. I sense a deep and abiding malice behind it. Phoenix: (I'll prove Maya's smile is the real deal!) Photo frame near TV (subsequent times, before presenting Family Photo) Phoenix: A photo of the high priest, his wife, Acolyte Zeh'lot, and Maya...

Photo frame near TV (after presenting Family Photo) Phoenix: It's that family photo they took. Mrs. Inmee said it was taken the day before the rite. I don't suppose any of them could've possibly imagined what was to come... Talk Puhray Zeh'lot Phoenix: How did Acolyte Zeh'lot end up living here as your husband's disciple? Beh'leeb: About two years ago, while my husband was at a spiritual retreat in the mountains... ...he came across Puhray collapsed on the ground. That's when he brought him here. You were always one to help those in need, weren't you, dear? Phoenix: ...And he'd been living here ever since? (About two years ago... That's around the same time Maya arrived in Khura'in.) Beh'leeb: Yes, he was born in a poor village and had nowhere to call home. My husband felt pity for the boy, so he took him in as his disciple. ...But not only as his disciple. He was like a member of our family, too. Phoenix: I see. (If this is where Acolyte Zeh'lot lived... ...there might be something I could learn about him lying around here.) The day before (appears after presenting Family Photo) Beh'leeb: This photo was taken during the Feast of Blessings. Phoenix: The Feast of Blessings? Beh'leeb: Yes. It is forbidden to eat during the days of the rite, so the day before it's performed... ...we enjoyed dishes full of gingihl, an herb known to strengthen the body and mind. You loved the gingihl-based dishes I make, didn't you, dear? Phoenix: Gingihl... I heard you can go three days without sleeping after eating some. Beh'leeb: Yes, but many foreigners don't care for it because of its strong smell. Our customs say that these dishes can only be eaten the day before the Purification Rite... ...and only between noon and 3 PM. Phoenix: That's pretty specific. Is it because the smell is too strong? Beh'leeb: A very good guess, indeed. It is to ensure the smell is gone by the time Lady Kee'ra is welcomed the next day. Phoenix: Wow, is it really that strong? (Come to think of it, the evening before the murder... ...an overwhelming odor was all over town. It was like a cross between garlic and mint.) Beh'leeb: After the Feast of Blessings, Puhray went over to the plaza to begin his supplication. I never thought that would be the last time I would see him. Phoenix: What was Maya doing at the time? Beh'leeb: Shortly after Puhray left, she went to the temple to prepare for the rite. ...I don't know what she did after that. Beh'leeb's Statement added to the Court Record. Phoenix: So, Acolyte Zeh'lot went out to pray the afternoon before the rite? (According to the newspaper... ...on the day before the rite, the plaza was so cold, the whole place had iced over.) Beh'leeb: Puhray always prayed a lot -- far more than anyone I have ever known. He was a devout young man whose faith was twice as strong as others. Phoenix: (I don't know why, but that's... kinda intimidating to me...) The day before (subsequent times) Beh'leeb: This photo was taken during the Feast of Blessings. Phoenix: The Feast of Blessings?

Phoenix: (I don't know why, but that's... kinda intimidating to me...) Present Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report Beh'leeb: Oh, poor Puhray. He has joined my husband in the Twilight Realm. He was so full of life before he went out to the plaza. Rayfa: This must be most difficult for you. It is like losing a family member. Beh'leeb: What's that, dear? ...Yes, you're right. I don't know what would've become of me if my husband were not here by my side. Phoenix: Umm... Is there anything you can tell me about Acolyte Zeh'lot that might help? Rayfa: He was a kindly young man. Let us leave it at that. Family Photo Phoenix: Can I ask you about this photo? Beh'leeb: It was taken during the Feast of Blessings, the day before the rite was held. Phoenix: The Feast of Blessings? Would you mind telling me a little more about it? After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: (I thought I'd have made some progress by now. But I haven't come across any particularly insightful information, even here.) Rayfa: You seem disappointed. Phoenix: Mrs. Inmee, is there anything else you could tell me? Beh'leeb: Forgive me. But if I keep thinking about those two any longer... Rayfa: Barbed Head... Phoenix: Yes, I understand. Thank you for your help. I'm sorry to have troubled you. Before clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag in Plaza of Devotion Rayfa: You have not found or heard anything of particular worth. Are you ready to give up? Phoenix: No, I'm not calling it quits yet! After clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag in Plaza of Devotion Rayfa: We have paid a visit to all of the people and places connected with this case. I think it is about time you prepared yourself for the inevitable. Don't you? Tehm'pul Temple Present Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report Rayfa: Ah, the second murder victim. Phoenix: Did you know Acolyte Zeh'lot, too, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: I knew of him. I know he had been living under the care of Abbot Inmee at his home, but little else. Phoenix: You mean like how they're letting me stay at the temple? Rayfa: Are you seriously trying to insult the poor victim with your comparison, you filthy dog? Phoenix: (Hey! What was THAT comparison for?!) Warbaa'd Dagger Rayfa: That is the sacred dagger used in the Purification Rite. In using it for murder, the vile criminal known as Maya Fey shall be cursed for all eternity. Phoenix: Nothing's been proven yet, so stop treating her like a criminal! Rayfa: How do explain the accused's fingerprints all over the dagger, then? And the fact that Abbot Inmee was slain with this very weapon? Phoenix: (I-I hate it when I have no comeback...!) After clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag in Plaza of Devotion and clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House: May 11Detention Center Maya: ............... Phoenix: (Maya sure looks tired.) I'm so sorry, Maya. I failed to defend you during that trial earlier today. Maya: I'm sorry, too, Nick. I never meant to get caught up in this whole mess. Even worse, I got you caught up in it, too, and you were convicted under that stupid law. Nick... You should really withdraw from this case. Maybe they'll even commute your sentence if you do! Phoenix: I-I could never abandon you like that! You might not believe me, but I'm going to pull off a win somehow. Maya: It's not like I don't believe in you, it's just... Phoenix: Don't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside out and upside down! You'll see! Maya: O-Okay... Rayfa: ..................... Phoenix: You're awfully quiet, Your Benevolence. Rayfa: It is only a matter of time until your executions are carried out. I simply thought I would allow you two a good talk before you depart from this world. Phoenix: Sorry, but we're not giving up yet. And we won't till the bitter end. Rayfa: There is no need to put on a brave face. Your fates were sealed with today's verdict. Worry not of Maya Fey. The Twilight Realm will cleanse the taint from that neophyte practitioner's soul. Then, perhaps, the Holy Mother may finally forgive her. Maya: ............... Phoenix: (Wait... Was that her attempt at comforting me?) Rayfa: Barbed Head, further resistance shall come to naught. Stop your desperate struggle. Accept the judgment that has been passed upon you. Phoenix: (She obviously doesn't know me very well.) Rayfa: Then, perhaps, your sentence will be commuted, and-- Maya: Hold it right there, Your Benevolence. Why do you always have to be like that? Phoenix: M-Maya, what are you... Rayfa: Wh-What is the matter? I was simply showing some mercy upon your souls. Maya: Nick here is risking his life to defend me. Rayfa: And that is why I told you it will come to nau-- Maya: No, it won't! Nick is just doing what lawyers are supposed to! He's defending his client, no matter what! Rayfa: Enough! There is no place for lawyers in the Hall of Justice! For we have the Divination S\u00e9ance! Maya: But your Insights were wrong! Rayfa: Nnngrrrr... Phoenix: (Ooh boy, that's gotta hurt.) Maya: Don't you get it? Errors are bound to happen if your Insights are accepted without question. So I ask you, royal priestess: What is your true duty? Do the victims' souls or the Holy Mother herself wish you to judge people in error? Rayfa: Oooooh... You dare bring Her Holiness's name into this?! You know nothing, you... you... phony baloney! Phoenix: P-Please, you two! Enough already! Maya: S-Sorry, Nick. I got a little carried away. That's not really like me, huh? Aha ha ha. Phoenix: No, I should be thanking you, Maya. It's good to have you in my corner. Rayfa: Hrrnh... How dare you mock me so! You will not get away with this! I was a fool to show you compassion. And to think I could convince you to accept your fate. So struggle all you want in the Hall of Justice tomorrow. You will receive your just desserts, as the scorn of our kingdom is heaped upon you! Phoenix: (...I can see straight through that contorted smile on your face, you know. *sigh* She may say these terrible things... ...but it's just the way she was raised, I guess.) Examine Bell Maya: A guard will come running if you ring that bell there. Phoenix: Really? Let's put that to the test, shall we? *jingle, jingle* Maya: Oh, but they got really mad last time when I rang it for no reason. Phoenix: You could've told me that before I rang it! Talk Zeh'lot's murder Phoenix: Could you try to remember what happened one more time? Maya: I've been trying as hard as I can... But I can't remember anything from the middle of the rite onward. Phoenix: Oh, right. You suddenly felt sleepy, and everything after that's a blank. Maya: Even so, I didn't kill anyone! And I'm not the one going around dressed like Lady Kee'ra! ...Although it's kind of cool to think there's a mysterious female vigilante out there. Phoenix: R-Right... Puhray Zeh'lot Phoenix: Were you close to Acolyte Zeh'lot? Maya: Umm... We met several times during the meetings about the rite. But I didn't know him very well. He seemed pretty quiet. Phoenix: Didn't you eat together the day before the rite? Maya: Yeah! We ate this one super-stinky dish, but it was actually really good! I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it was love at first bite! Like... You know the salty noodles at Eldoon's Noodles? It's like if you added garlic and herbs to that, and then let it simmer for a really long time. Phoenix: (Sounds more like a hot pot than ramen to me at that point...) Maya: *sigh* Now I miss ramen, too... Phoenix: Umm... so what was Acolyte Zeh'lot like while you were eating? Maya: ...He seemed to be enjoying the food. But as soon as we were done, he left to go pray. Phoenix: And what did you do? Maya: Oh, umm... I returned to the temple to prepare for the rite. Phoenix: (That coincides with Mrs. Inmee's description of events.) Lady Kee'ra's identity (appears after \"Puhray Zeh'lot\") Phoenix: Any idea who might be pretending to be Lady Kee'ra? Maya: Hmm... When the rite started, it was just me and Abbot Inmee. Phoenix: But the S\u00e9ance vision showed a third figure who looked like Lady Kee'ra. Maya: I know... *sigh* Lady Kee'ra... I wish I could've seen her in the flesh. Phoenix: Umm, yeah... (Let's stay focused on the case, shall we?) It was supposed to have been impossible for a third party to enter the Inner Sanctum. Maya: Ah! But what if she came from the sky? You know, like that bushy-bearded paratrooper! That mountain would've been no match for Lady Kee'ra's wings! Phoenix: That's from the Plumed Punisher TV show, right? Maya: H-How'd you know? Phoenix: Because the real Lady Kee'ra doesn't have wings. Maya: Ooh! I've got it this time! There must be a secret room with a secret door at the Inner Sanctum! Did you know there are eighty-eight secret Plumed Punisher bases here in Khura'in? Phoenix: Can we please stop talking about the Plumed Punisher show for a sec, Maya? Maya: I guess so. *sigh* Keeping it real is much harder than it looks. Present Plumed Punisher Strap Maya: It's my Plumed Punisher strap! There's only one of them in the entire world! I'll treasure it for the rest of my life! Phoenix: .........Your Benevolence? I can't help but notice how hard you're staring at this strap. Rayfa: M-Me?! Want that?! Sorry, but you are sorely mistaken! Maya: Hey, Your Benevolence? Would you let me out of here in exchange for the strap? Rayfa: ....................................... ...What a preposterous idea! Phoenix: (It didn't stop you from entertaining it, though, did it?) Lady Kee'ra's Warning Maya: Nick, I'm not the one going around impersonating Lady Kee'ra. Phoenix: I know, Maya. I believe you. Rayfa: Oh, please. Dispense with this bungling act. Phoenix: I'm going to prove that Maya isn't Lady Kee'ra. Rayfa: Why bother? She is already as good as guilty. And floundering about will not change that fact. Phoenix: I don't care. I'll keep fighting until the very last crack of His Magistry's gavel! Rayfa: Hmph. You truly are...a nincompoop. Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report Maya: First Abbot Inmee, and now Acolyte Zeh'lot... Rayfa: Spare me your crocodile tears. We both know it was YOU who slew those pious men! Maya: N-No, it wasn't me! Nick... How can we make her understand? Phoenix: Probably only by getting to the bottom of things in court tomorrow... Warbaa'd Dagger Maya: I can't believe the sacred dagger was used in a murder. Rayfa: Only a truly irreverent individual would dare do such a thing. And it was your fingerprints that were found upon the weapon. How do you explain that? Maya: I used the dagger during our rehearsals! That's why it has my fingerprints on it. Rayfa: And how do I know you are not lying? Maya: Ugh... Why won't you believe me? Phoenix: Just let it go, Maya. There's no changing her mind right now... Family Photo Maya: We took this picture during the Feast of Blessings... ...before all of these unthinkably tragic things happened... Rayfa: Unthinkable? I doubt that. You were surely plotting your murderous rampage at the time. Maya: I was thinking of nothing of the sort -- especially not during that meal! The smell of gingihl was so strong, I couldn't think of anything else. Rayfa: Yes, well, it IS a rather intense aroma... Phoenix: (Wow... Do I even want to know how strong of a smell gingihl gives off up close...?) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Well, I should get going now. Maya: ...Sorry I wasn't any help. Phoenix: Don't worry. I've got this. We'll beat the charges tomorrow and be on the first plane back home before you know it. Then we'll go grab dinner at Eldoon's, or your favorite burger joint! You pick! Maya: ...Sounds good! I think I'll get the extra-large Hamburg steak topping on my salty bowl! Best of both worlds! Phoenix: You can have whatever you like! (But first, I have to beat the charges.) Maya: Ah! I almost forgot! Phoenix: Ack! Wh-What is it? Maya: I have a favor to ask. Phoenix: Okay... But why are we whispering? Maya: I forgot I left something at the high priest's house. It's super important! Would you mind getting and holding on to it for me? Phoenix: Sure. So what's this super important thing? Maya: In my bag, you'll find a folding book. It's only given to the priestess who performs the rite. It's called the Tome of Secrets. Phoenix: That does sound important. How could you leave something like that just lying around? (That explains all the whispering. If Rayfa found out, all heck would break loose.) Maya: Look, it's got Lady Kee'ra's real name written in it, so... Oops! Don't tell anyone I told you that! In fact, just forget I said anything at all! It's supposed to be a secret! Phoenix: The Tome of Secrets contains... secrets? Imagine that. Rayfa: Hm? What are you two whispering about? Phoenix: Oh, um, n-nothing. It's just she forgot something, so I told her I'd go get it. Rayfa: ...You are up to something, I just know it. Maya: Thanks, Nick! I'm counting on you! Tehm'pul Temple, Plaza of Devotion, Inner Sanctum, Detention Center, or Bazaar Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: So, are you ready to give up, Barbed Head? Any more of this and you will cause Lady Inmee to suffer more than she already is. Phoenix: I understand what you mean, but I can't give up that easily. After all, I have to defend Maya in court. Rayfa: Stubborn fool. ...But you have already been found guilty. If you wish to continue floundering about, I suppose now is your last chance. Phoenix: I'll take every chance I can get. What to do Rayfa: What? Have you given up already? Phoenix: Not even close! Still, it does feel like I'm barely treading water over here. Rayfa: Water? Do all the people of your country go for a swim when they are troubled? If so, seek the rivers on the edge of town. There you will find all the water you need. Go ahead, paddle to your heart's content! Phoenix: (English idioms go right over her head.) May 11High Priest's House Phoenix: Hello? Anybody home? No answer... Mrs. Inmee's probably out right now. Well, I'll just get what I came for. Rayfa: I am watching you like a warbaa'd, Barbed Head! You had better not steal anything! Phoenix: I would never do something like that! I'm just here to get what Maya asked for! Rayfa: Then get on with it. Phoenix: I would if you'd stop interrupting me... Examine Handbag Leads to: \"Ah, here's Maya's bag.\" Phoenix: (Ah, here's Maya's bag.) Rayfa: Hm? What is that strange patch on her bag? Phoenix: It's the Steel Samurai. He's the hero of an action-hero show back in my country. It's actually Maya's favorite show. She's got all sorts of merchandise related to it. Rayfa: I see... He looks strikingly similar to the Plumed Punisher. Phoenix: They are similar, but... (...the Steel Samurai definitely came first.) Rayfa: I see... How interesting... Phoenix: (Rayfa seems genuinely intrigued. There must a common thread between Plumed Punisher and Steel Samurai fans. Come to think of it... ...didn't Maya mention something about trading with a Plumed Punisher fan? But I digress... I'd better find what she asked me to look for and get going.) Let's see here... This must be that Tome of Secrets that Maya was talking about. Tome of Secrets added to the Court Record. Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Are you finished now? Phoenix: Hold on a second. The string around it is coming undone... Whoops! Oh...! Rayfa: AHHHHH! YOU FOOL! Do not lay eyes upon it! Put it away! Quickly! Before we go blind! Phoenix: Relax. My hand just slipped. Rayfa: This is the Tome of Secrets! Are you trying to get us cursed?! Lady Kee'ra is liable to swoop down and gouge our eyes out! Phoenix: Oh, right. This book is related to Lady Kee'ra, isn't it? Your Benevolence, would you mind if I asked you some questions? Rayfa: Hmph... Examine Handbag Rayfa: What is that strange patch on her bag again? Phoenix: It's for the Steel Samurai, this action hero back in my country. Rayfa: It looks so similar to the Plumed Punisher -- strikingly so. Hmm, I see... \"The Steel Samurai\"... Phoenix: You're actually interested in it, aren't you? Rayfa: Wh-Whatever gave you that idea?! Move Rayfa: Where do you think you are going, Barbed Head? Were you not the one who said you wished to speak with me? Phoenix: (I better stay here and talk to Rayfa for now.) Talk Tome of Secrets Rayfa: This is not something I would normally speak about to an outsider such as you. Phoenix: Well, can't you make an exception?! Rayfa: If you insist... Nayna! What of this folding book? ...Yes, I see... This very important tome is bestowed upon the priestess in the Purification Rite. Phoenix: *gulp* Very important? Wh-What's written inside? Rayfa: Yes, yes... Yes, I see... ...Really? Is it all right to reveal that? Phoenix: ...Um, uhhh... Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Patience, patience! The book contains Lady Kee'ra's true name. Phoenix: Her true name? Is a name really that important of a secret? Rayfa: To a Khura'inist priestess, a person's name is one of the most important things to know. Lady Kee'ra's real name (appears after \"Tome of Secrets\") Phoenix: What's so important about a name? Rayfa: Without a name, a priestess's voice will fail to reach a person's mitamah. It is much like trying to send a letter without the recipient's address. A spirit can only be identified once you know the deceased's face and name. Phoenix: Oh, I get it. It's like when you see someone in a crowd you recognize, but you don't know their name. It makes it impossible to get their attention. Rayfa: Indeed. You must know a spirit's face and true name before you can commune with it. It is the same for Khura'inism's most secret art, one that my mother alone may use. Phoenix: The queen has a secret art? Rayfa: Hmph, it is something a foreigner such as you could never hope to guess. Maya: In Khura'inism, spirit channeling is a secret art that can only be performed by the queen. No one else is supposed to be able to do it. Phoenix: (I should pretend this is all new to me. Besides, I get the feeling she secretly really wants to tell me all about it.) The queen's secret art (appears after \"Lady Kee'ra's real name\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about this secret art of the queen you spoke of? Rayfa: Come again? Phoenix: Oh, sorry. Maybe we shouldn't talk about this. It IS a secret after all, right? Rayfa: It is the secret art of spirit channeling. But I suppose those words are meaningless to you. Phoenix: I'm just surprised how willing you are to tell me about it. Rayfa: A third-rate lawyer could not channel spirits simply by learning of the technique. Phoenix: (Third-rate is a bit harsh. I'd even settle for second.) Rayfa: What is it? You have the look of a tentacled hag frog upon your face. Phoenix: (What the heck is a tentacled hag frog?!) ...Spirit channeling... That's where a medium lets a spirit possess her body to return to our world, right? Rayfa: Well now. I see you have done your homework. Phoenix: Oh, I guess I studied a bit. Eh heh. Rayfa: With the power of spirit channeling, one can bring back even the most ancient of spirits! It is quite a magnificent power, is it not? Phoenix: (I've never seen her eyes light up like this before.) I imagine they're pretty shocked when they come back from ancient times. Rayfa: Indeed. A spirit's memory is cut off at the moment of death. Phoenix: So even a spirit that is brought back after centuries doesn't sense any gap in time... ...between the moment of its death, and the moment it is channeled? Rayfa: Yes, and yet, it clearly recalls all of the memories it had in life. Thus, even heroes and scholars of antiquity can be channeled and directly learned from. Our queens have also used this power to help the rulers of neighboring lands seek counsel. That is why we have never been invaded, and how we have maintained our unique culture. Phoenix: So, spirit channeling is a really effective tool for international politics. Rayfa: It is, indeed. And that is why only those with the power to channel spirits may rule our kingdom. But of late, there has been an endless influx of illegal immigrants from neighboring lands. The fools come seeking the same great power as my mother. Phoenix: Illegal immigrants? Rayfa: Yes. It is becoming quite a problem. Some have lost their way in life, and look to Khura'inism for their salvation. Among them are also those of dubious nature, who have been driven from their own lands. Phoenix: (Dubious nature... Driven from their own land... Gaspen Payne definitely fit that bill. But they sure weren't treating him like an illegal alien.) Rayfa's spiritual power (appears after \"The queen's secret art\") Leads to: \"Can you channel spirits, Your Benevolence?\" Present Tome of Secrets Rayfa: You fool! Why have you put the Tome of Secrets before me?! Phoenix: What's the big deal? Rayfa: S-Stay back! Come no closer! Phoenix: (Hey, this thing's actually pretty useful!) Lookie here, Your Benevolence. It's the Tome of Seeecrets. Rayfa: If you do not desist this instant, I shall have you put to death for the crime of blasphemy! Phoenix: Urk! S-Sorry! (...If looks could kill, I'd already be dead.) Phoenix: Can you channel spirits, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: I am but the royal priestess. There is still much that I must learn. As of now, the Divination S\u00e9ance takes me to the very limit of my ability. Phoenix: (So, her spiritual power doesn't measure up to Maya's.) Rayfa: ...You were just mocking me in your mind, weren't you? Phoenix: D-Don't be ridiculous! Rayfa: It is written all over your face! You... impudent nincompoop! The Divination S\u00e9ance was once one of the important roles fulfilled by the queen. That is what my mother taught me when I was little. Phoenix: (So the queen can perform the Dance of Devotion? That'd be a sight to see.) Rayfa: Someday, I will be a powerful priestess and queen, just like my mother. And the Divination S\u00e9ance is a vital part of my training to prepare me for that day! Phoenix: F-Forgive my ignorance, Your Benevolence. Rayfa: Hmph, you shall see. It will not be long before I, too, master the secret art of spirit channeling! I will be a magnificent queen who unites her people for the greater good of Khura'in! Phoenix: (Now I see... Spirit channeling is something she really aspires to.) Maya: I'm going to ace that test and become the next master! After all, I can't let my clan and the other villagers down. Phoenix: (It looks like she actually has something in common with Maya.) Rayfa: Are you quite through now? There are more important things to do than to stand here and talk about spirit channeling. Phoenix: (That's true. It doesn't have anything to do with this case, as far as I can tell. Or does it...?) Umm... If the queen is a spirit medium... Rayfa: Are you about to suggest that my mother was channeling Lady Kee'ra? Phoenix: Ack! (I guess she saw that one coming.) Rayfa: Hmph, lawyers are indeed a witless breed! On the day of the rite, my mother was engaged in other duties at the palace. Phoenix: Of course... Rayfa: My mother is a very busy woman. And the idea itself is preposterous. Do you truly believe the queen of Khura'in would personally battle the insurgents? This is precisely what makes you third-rate! Phoenix: Urk! (Another dead end! This is bad!) A-Anyway, I need to continue looking for leads, so... ???: Over there! After him! Don't let him escape! Rayfa: What is all that racket? What? That escaped prisoner has surfaced here in town? Phoenix: Escaped prisoner? You mean... that guy with the bushy beard? Rayfa: There is no reason to panic. The police are on his trail. Phoenix: (He's no longer a suspect... But he might know something, considering he was at the scene of the crime.) Let's go take a look! Rayfa: Wait! May 11Khura'in - Bazaar Phoenix: *huff* *puff* Oww, my aching back. I forgot how badly I'd injured it. Ow, ow, ow... I need to do some stretching and exercise more when I get back home. ???: Ah, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: *huff* *puff* ...H-Hey, Ahlbi. Datz... Are'bal... Have you seen hi-- Ow, ow, ow! Ahlbi: A-Are you all right, sir? Phoenix: One second... *huff* *puff* *wheeeeeze* Have you seen... that escaped prisoner around here? Ahlbi: Oh, so that's why all those police came rushing over here. I heard them saying something about an escaped prisoner disappearing in this area. Phoenix: He disappeared in this area? He couldn't have taken to the air again, could he? Rayfa: Barbed Head! *huff* *huff* I told you to wait! Phoenix: It's too dangerous for you around here, Your Benevolence. Mr. Are'bal could be lurking nearby! Rayfa: What sort of a princess would I be if all it took was an escaped prisoner to frighten me?! Phoenix: (She's fearless, I'll give her that.) I can't be responsible if something happens to you. (As long as I'm here, though, I might as well search the area myself. Hmm... If I were an escaped prisoner, where would I hide?) Examine Manhole Phoenix: That manhole cover... It's open! Shah'do: Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff! Ahlbi: Whoa! What is it, Shah'do?! Phoenix: Did he sniff out someone or something in the manhole? (Hmm, I wonder...) Could Shah'do track Mr. Are'bal if he had something with the rebel's scent on it? Ahlbi: I-I don't know... Phoenix: (I feel like I've got something with Mr. Are'bal's scent on it... Something he might've touched...) Talk Any ideas? Phoenix: Have you noticed anything around here? Ahlbi: I haven't seen the escaped prisoner. But I did notice how slow you run, sir. Phoenix: (It's just the high elevation. I'm out of breath before I know it!) What to do Ahlbi: The police said the escaped prisoner vanished right around here. Phoenix: Hmm, there aren't any really good hiding places, so where could he have gone? Ahlbi: Maybe he melted into the crowd. Phoenix: You should be careful, Your Benevolence. Rayfa: You need not tell me that! I am not a child, after all! Phoenix: Okay, okay... Present Plumed Punisher Strap Ahlbi: That is THE Plumed Punisher strap. There's only one in the entire world! Phoenix: Oh, do you know a lot about the Plumed Punisher? Ahlbi: Of course! She's a real hero to the people! Phoenix: The ratings for the show must be through the roof. Ahlbi: They are! It reached 100 percent viewership at one point! Phoenix: One hundred percent?! Ahlbi: Well, when there's only one TV channel in the entire kingdom... Phoenix: Oh, that explains it. Warbaa'd Dagger Ahlbi: That's the dagger that was used in the rite. It's said that Lady Kee'ra once wielded it. In addition to that dagger, there are many other items that are said to have been hers. Phoenix: Really? Like what? Ahlbi: There's the obvious stuff, like swords, spears, and other weapons. But there are other, more interesting items, like her favorite hat and her favorite pillow. Phoenix: Her pillow...? Ahlbi: Yes. They say if you use it, Lady Kee'ra will ensure you have a restful slumber. Phoenix: As long as it's not eternal... Brand New Flag (after examining manhole) Leads to: \"Here, Shah'do. How about this?\" Phoenix: Here, Shah'do. How about this? I hope it works... Shah'do: Grrr... Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff! Phoenix: I think he's picked up a scent! You mind if I borrow Shah'do for a bit?! Ahlbi: By all means! I had no idea you could do this! Yeah! Go get 'im, boy! Shah'do: Ruff, ruff, ruff! Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I'm heading down the manhole now. It could be dangerous, so please wait here! Rayfa: Wait! Phoenix: Don't worry, I won't commit any of those misdeeds you're so worried about. Rayfa: That is not what I fear! There may be a vicious insurgent lurking down there! Phoenix: Oh, are you worried about me? Rayfa: No. I was simply wondering why you would go to such lengths in your investigation. After all, if you would simply withdraw from this case, they might commute your sentence. Phoenix: I'm doing this to prove Maya innocent. Rayfa: But how can you be so sure of the accused's innocence?! She has already been found guilty! Phoenix: Don't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside out and upside down! You'll see! Maya: O-Okay... Phoenix: I believe in her. If she says she's innocent, then that means she's innocent. Lawyers must trust in their clients to the bitter end. That's just what we do. Rayfa: ......... You... lamebrain. Do what you will! Phoenix: Well, I'm going in! Let's go, Shah'do! Shah'do: Ruff, ruff! Ahlbi: Be careful! Shah'do!: Ruff, ruff! Phoenix: W-Wait! Come back here! It's pitch black down here. I can't see a thing. *WHAM* Phoenix: Aaagh! Phoenix: Ooogh... Owww owww owwww... What happened? I went down into the manhole, and then... ???: Oh, ya finally came to? Phoenix: Ah! (I'd remember that face anywhere! And that dragon symbol on his armband... That's the mark of the rebels! There can be no mistake! It's him -- Datz Are'bal!) YIKES! Datz: Sorry I got a little rough with ya back there. Thought ya were the cops. Why ya making that face? ...Hey, want an apple? Phoenix: (Whew...I thought he was going to kill me.) I-I'll pass on the apple, but thanks. (I don't mind a good apple, but not right now.) What is this place? Datz: This is the office of my brother in arms, Dhurke! But right now, we're using it as a rebel safe house! Phoenix: Wait, back up a sec. What kind of office is this exactly? Datz: A law office, what else?! Phoenix: Really?! Dhurke used to be a lawyer?! Datz: Yep! Just like you! Phoenix: (Khura'in's public enemy number one is an ex-lawyer? Didn't see that coming.) Datz: But I don't suppose I'll be coming 'round here anymore. Phoenix: You won't? Are you planning to flee or something? Datz: It's just... I wanna get outta the rebel business. Tired o' being hounded by the cops and all that. So I came by today to pick up the last o' my stuff. Phoenix: R-Really...? Datz: I'm gonna sell Dhurke's info to the minister o' justice, then slip outta Khura'in! Phoenix: ...W-Wait a second! You're a key person of interest in this case! You can't go running off like that! Datz: Relax, will ya? I'll tell ya whatever ya need to know. Oh, and sorry about punching your lights out back there. My bad! So, Mr. Lawyer Man, whaddaya wanna know? Phoenix: Tell me about the murders of the high priest Tahrust Inmee, and his acolyte Puhray Zeh'lot. Datz: Sure, I'll tell ya whatever I can. Don't know if it'll be much help, though. I mean, I'm not a rebel anymore, so... Phoenix: (I wonder how true that really is...) Examine Picture of Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in Phoenix: (There's a knife driven deep into a photo of the queen. I guess the rebels really hate her. I better remember to stay on their good side.) White flowers Phoenix: Incense and white flowers... (The flowers are still fresh. They must've been put here maybe today or yesterday.) Did you put these here, Mr. Are'bal? Datz: ...Something wrong with flowers? Phoenix: Oh, no! Datz: It's just a traditional thing here in Khura'in. Pay it no mind. Ladder Phoenix: There's a ladder leading underground. He must've brought me in through there. But there's no reason for me to leave yet. I should see what else Mr. Are'bal has to say. Photos Phoenix: This looks like a photo of Dhurke and his compatriots... And here's one that looks really old... Wow, this was taken about twenty years ago. Datz: Those are Dhurke's sons. Phoenix: Really? So this is the rebel Dhurke in the center? He doesn't look so evil. And both of his sons... look kind of familiar... Datz: The one on the left is Yuty. Oh, but you know him as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi is Dhurke's son?! Datz: That he is! Yuty was once a rebel, too! He used to really respect his old man... ...both as a father and as a lawyer. Phoenix: Then why'd he become a prosecutor? Datz: Being a lawyer in this kingdom is the same as signing your own death warrant. Phoenix: On account of the Defense Culpability Act, right? Datz: Yeah. That's why Yuty decided to be a prosecutor instead. He wanted to spark a revolution from the inside, so he dove right into the enemy's den! Phoenix: I would've never guessed it, looking at him now. Datz: You can say that again. Dhurke is battling to change Khura'in's legal system. The will of the dragon spurs him on. We all thought Yuty was taking up the mantle to carry on that will, too... We were sure he'd help overthrow Ga'ran one day, but... As you've seen, he now uses the law to do her bidding. Dhurke's been beside himself. Phoenix: (So he no longer carries the will of the dragon in him, huh... I wonder what happened between father and son for it to come to this?) What about the other child in the photo? Datz: That's Dhurke's adopted son, but he's gone back overseas. His name's Apollo. Phoenix: (Apollo? Wait a second... That bracelet... It really IS Apollo!) Datz: He was a rascal, that one! And his voice could shake the entire room! I imagine he's out there raising high hell somewhere! Phoenix: Ha, aha ha... Yes, I'm sure he's doing just fine. (Considering how far he's come, Mr. Are'bal's description really doesn't do Apollo justice!) Phoenix: ............Apollo! I've been watching you grow over these past two years. That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo. Apollo: ...Thank you! I'll... I'll be fine! Everything will be fine! Phoenix: (He's a responsible young man now. He never lost that loud voice, though.) Photos (subsequent times) Phoenix: This looks like a photo of Dhurke and his compatriots... And here's one that's really old... Datz: Those are Dhurke's sons. The one on the left is Prosecutor Sahdmadhi when he was younger. I used to call him Yuty. Thought he'd carry on the will of the dragon and become a fine lawyer, but... Phoenix: And the other child is...? Datz: That's Dhurke's adopted son, but he's gone back overseas. His name's Apollo. Phoenix: (That name, and that bracelet... Yep, that has to be our Apollo.) Datz: He was a rascal, that one! And his voice could shake the entire room! I imagine he's out there raising high hell somewhere! Phoenix: Ha, aha ha... Yes, I'm sure he's doing just fine. (Considering how far he's come, Mr. Are'bal's description really doesn't do Apollo justice!) Lizards Phoenix: What are these hanging here? Lizards? ...If so, they're pretty big. Datz: Those're sewer lizards! We call 'em that 'cause they live in the sewer! They grow bigger than your average lizard, which makes 'em fine eating! Phoenix: Wait, you eat these? Datz: What else would ya do with 'em?! Here, try one! Phoenix: Pass! I'll definitely pass! Datz: ...You're missing out on a fine treat, my man! Phoenix: S-Somehow, I think I'll live without it. Food on table Phoenix: (There are bowls and platters of food here. ...They're still warm, as if this was all recently prepared.) You must have a pretty big appetite, Mr. Are'bal. Datz: Har har har har har! Guys as big and strong as me... Got even bigger appetites, y'know! Phoenix: But you just fled from the police. I don't know how you could eat this much after all that excitement. Ack! S-Sorry if I offended you! Datz: But first, let's start with an apple-tizer! Phoenix: (Where's he getting all those apples from?!) Datz: Wanna join me, Mr. Lawyer Man? Got plenty of sewer lizards, too! Phoenix: T-Thanks, but I already ate. Coat Phoenix: Is that coat yours, Mr. Are'bal? Datz: Nah, it belongs to the rebel leader Dhurke. Phoenix: It's pretty impressive. I like the color, too. Datz: ...Wanna try it on? Phoenix: Really? You sure it's okay? Datz: Of course. Bet it would look great on ya! Phoenix: Well then, don't mind if I do... ......... Ack! It smells all moldy! Datz: Haaaar har har har har! I can't believe ya fell for it! Haaar haaar! That thing's been hanging there forever! Phoenix: (Note to self: Don't trust this guy ever again.) Sign Phoenix: What's this thing with the dragon on it? Some kind of a sign? Datz: Yep. That was his business sign back when this was Dhurke's office. Phoenix: He used to be a lawyer, right? Datz: That he was, but it was a really long time ago. This place has seen better days, that's for sure. Phoenix: Well, I hope he can put his sign back up someday. Datz: .........I wouldn't hold my breath. TV or refrigerator Phoenix: You guys get electricity? Datz: Yeah, but the power goes out occasionally. Phoenix: That's pretty inconvenient. Datz: You're telling me! Sometimes, it goes out for an entire day. Phoenix: What about the stuff in the refrigerator? Datz: Why don't you see for yourself? Phoenix: Forget I asked! (I'm afraid of what I might find...) Book Phoenix: Is this... a law book? (A dragon mark's been branded into the cover.) Datz: That's Dhurke's law book. Phoenix: Really?! The leader of the rebels? That Dhurke? Datz: That's right. And that \"Mark of the Dragon\" is the emblem of the rebellion! Phoenix: Hmm, the pages in this one section are really dirty. Datz: Must be the section on the Defense Culpability Act. Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record. Phoenix: He must've done a ton of research on the Defense Culpability Act. He practically wore out the entire section. Book (subsequent times) Phoenix: Is this... a law book? (A dragon mark's been branded into the cover.) Datz: That's Dhurke's law book. Phoenix: Really?! The leader of the rebels? That Dhurke? Datz: That's right. And that \"Mark of the Dragon\" is the emblem of the rebellion! Phoenix: Hmm, the pages in this one section are really dirty. Datz: Must be the section on the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: He must've done a ton of research on the Defense Culpability Act. He practically wore out the entire section. Talk The high priest's murder Phoenix: Tell me everything you know about the high priest's murder. Datz: Uhh... Well, as ya know, I don't remember much about that. I banged my head on a rock as soon as I parachuted into the Inner Sanctum. So when I told you I had nothing to do with his murder, I meant it! Phoenix: Okay then, where were you when you came to after banging your head? Datz: Uhh... By the time I came to, it was already dawn. I musta been out cold the whole time! Phoenix: So you didn't see the crime happen at all...? Datz: ...Ya got that right! Phoenix: Then why did you say you did when you testified?! Datz: Oh, uhh... About that... Since I didn't remember a thing... ...I was afraid I'd seem suspicious, so I came up with that whole story! Phoenix: (Does he even realize how much trouble his big fat lie has caused me?) Datz: Sorry for the trouble! It was definitely my bad! Phoenix: (He doesn't seem very sorry to me!) So, the bottom line is you were at the scene of the crime, but weren't involved in it. Got it. Dhurke the attorney (appears after \"The high priest's murder\") Phoenix: So, Dhurke used to be a lawyer? Datz: Yep! He was a force to be reckoned with back when he was still practicing! He was a juggernaut of the law, and as mighty as a dragon! He could strike terror into a prosecutor's heart, just by glaring at him. People called it his \"dragon's glare.\" He even got criminals to confess and pass out with a well-placed glare! Phoenix: (You've got to be kidding me...) Datz: But most important of all, he would never surrender. He'd fight for the accused, no matter how the odds were stacked against him. Phoenix: Is that what you mean by the will of the dragon? Datz: Yep, that would be it! Actually... Your work in court yesterday was mighty impressive, too! You didn't give up, no matter how hard of a beating you took! ...Not unlike Dhurke, I might add! Phoenix: Oh, um... thanks. (Even if a big part of that beating I took was because of you...) Present Anything Datz: Is this a parting gift for me leaving the rebels? Phoenix: N-No, you can't keep it! (I'll just ask him what I can for now.) After clearing \"Dhurke the attorney\" Talk option and examining white flowers, photos, food on table, and book: Datz: Well, I gotta start packing. Who knows when they might catch up with me if I don't scram soon? Phoenix: Please, wait! I still need to ask you something. Datz: Go ahead, shoot. Phoenix: What are you rebels trying to do? Datz: .................. Phoenix: And why were you at the Inner Sanctum in the first place? Talk Mr. Are'bal's plan Phoenix: Why were you at the Inner Sanctum on the day of the murder? Or more precisely, what were you trying to do there? Datz: I was trying to escape from prison, that's all. But that high priest was a fool for getting taken in by Dhurke. He shoulda tried hightailing it outta Khura'in like I'm doing! 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: Ah... Psyche-Locks! (Mr. Are'bal is hiding something! But I won't know exactly what until I can undo the locks!) What exactly are you trying to hide, Mr. Are'bal? Datz: Huh? I'm not hiding anything! No way, no how! Phoenix: (...I'll just have to use my magatama on him, then.) Present Magatama Phoenix: 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Datz's Plan -- Phoenix: I'm going to ask you again: Why were you at the Inner Sanctum on the day of the murder? Or more precisely, what were you trying to do there? Datz: Ya can keep asking, but the answer's still the same. I was trying to escape from prison, that's all. ...But that high priest was a fool. He fell for Dhurke's line and sold his own country out. Phoenix: How can you say such things about him?! He helped you escape, didn't he? Don't you even care about what happened to him? Datz: Nope. I was getting out of the rebellion, anyway. He should've opened his eyes. We never stood a chance against the Ga'ran regime. Phoenix: Hang on. Do you really believe what you're saying? Didn't the high priest's death really hurt you on the inside? Datz: Like I just said, I couldn't care less about the whole thing! Phoenix: I beg to differ. This wouldn't be here in this room if you didn't feel a thing. Present Nahmanda Flower Phoenix: Leads to: \"I heard these flowers are offered in memory of the dead here in Khura'in.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: What does that have to do with anything? Phoenix: You don't know? Try looking deep into your heart. Datz: Umm... I still don't get it. But I'm starting to think you don't, either! Phoenix: (Arngh... Why does it feel so much worse when it's him who's pointing out my failures?) Datz: I told ya, I couldn't care less about the high priest! Phoenix: (Really...? Because I'm pretty sure I have something that points to his grief.) Leads back to: \"I beg to differ. This wouldn't be here in this room if you didn't feel a thing.\" Phoenix: I heard these flowers are offered in memory of the dead here in Khura'in. The high priest's death hit you hard, so you've been grieving here alone, haven't you? Well? Datz: Hee-HO! 1 LOCK BROKEN Datz: Those flowers don't mean anything. It's just a Khura'inese way o' saying goodbye. Phoenix: Why hide the fact that you're mourning his death? Datz: You're reading into this too much. I told ya, I'm done with the rebellion! I haven't even heard from Dhurke or the rest of 'em for a few days. And tomorrow, I'm planning to kiss this kingdom goodbye! Phoenix: No, I know you've been in contact with the other rebels lately! Datz: And how exactly do you plan on proving that?! Phoenix: This piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels! Present Brand New Flag Phoenix: Leads to: \"I found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: ............ Phoenix: Cat got your tongue? Datz: No, it's just, I was shocked at how off-target ya are. Wait, you're not stalling for time or something, are ya? Phoenix: N-No, I'd never do that. (I hope he doesn't think I'm in cahoots with the police or something...) Datz: I keep trying to tell ya -- I got nothing to do with the rebels anymore. Phoenix: (This food was brought here for Mr. Are'bal after he escaped from prison. So he must've gotten in contact with the other rebels somehow.) No, I know you're still involved with them! Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels!\" Phoenix: I found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion. You wrote a message on it, and left it behind for your fellow rebels, didn't you? Datz: Gulp! Phoenix: They brought this food for you at your request. Datz: Hoo-HA HA! Phoenix: So you're lying about leaving the rebels. You're still involved with Dhurke and the rest of them, aren't you? Datz: Naaaaaaaargh! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Are you ready to tell me the truth now? Datz: Oh, you're good, Mr. Lawyer Man! I admit it! I requested the grub. But I was just taking advantage of 'em, that's all! Phoenix: What do you mean? Datz: With my face plastered all over the place, I couldn't stay out in the open anymore. So, I just took advantage of my former comrades for some grub and a place to hide. I was gonna kiss this kingdom goodbye tomorrow! Phoenix: I'm not buying it. You're obviously lying. I can tell just by looking at you. The white-hot flames of revolution definitely still burn on inside of you! Datz: What?! That's ridiculous. Those flames burned out a long time ago! Phoenix: This proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you! Present Dhurke's Law Book Phoenix: Leads to: \"Dhurke's law book? I'm no lawyer, so what's that got to do with me?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: Ah! Phoenix: I'm right, aren't I?! That's why you're so shocked! Datz: Yeesh, I almost forgot about dessert! Phoenix: (I guess that wasn't it.) Datz: Would you give up already? The flames of revolution burned out inside of me a long time ago! Phoenix: (No, I know they still burn on. Because he's wearing something that proves it!) You can't fool me, Mr. Are'bal. Leads back to: \"This proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you!\" Datz: Dhurke's law book? I'm no lawyer, so what's that got to do with me? Phoenix: Look at the mark branded onto the cover. This mark that stands for an unwavering commitment to the revolution. It is Dhurke's way of representing the will of the dragon! Datz: Yeah? So what of it?! Phoenix: You have that same mark on the scarf tied around your left arm. But you wouldn't be wearing that if you were no longer a rebel! Datz: I-I... I forgot to take it off, that's all! Phoenix: No, as a wanted man, that should've been the first thing you took off! The fact that you haven't hidden that mark yet... proves you're still a rebel! Datz: Hoo-HA! 1 LOCK BROKEN Datz: Think whatcha want! But you don't know nothing about me! Phoenix: No, you're wrong. You wear your heart and your beliefs right on your sleeve -- just like me. And this is what I believe in. Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Leads to: \"...............\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: That's what you believe in? Phoenix: Sure! And I never waver from it! Datz: That's the lamest belief I ever heard of! Haaaaaar har har har har! Phoenix: (I didn't think it was THAT funny...) Datz: I was right, you don't know a thing about me! Phoenix: Actually, I know you wear your beliefs right on your sleeve -- just like me. Leads back to: \"And this is what I believe in.\" Datz: ............... Phoenix: When a person's back is against a wall, they always fall back on what they believe in. Just as I always have my badge, you always have the will of the dragon with you. Datz: And would you risk your life for your beliefs? Phoenix: ...No, I wouldn't. Datz: No? Phoenix: No, because I wouldn't be much use to my clients dead. Now, admit it! You've never once thought about leaving the Defiant Dragons, have you! Datz: .........That look in your eyes. It's just like Dhurke's. ...Looks like you've got the will of the dragon inside o' ya, too. 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Mr. Are'bal's plan (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Datz: I had planned to take ya out if ya turned out to be on the side of the royals... But I think I can trust ya. Phoenix: (I can't believe I was that close to getting shanked here...) Datz: It's like ya said. I've no intention of leaving Dhurke's group. Phoenix: In other words, you were testing me. Datz: You're a foreigner, and a lawyer who's been charged with abetting a criminal to boot. And I've seen a fair share of lawyers get pardoned... ...after weeping at the feet of the queen. Phoenix: Well, I'm going to keep fighting till the end. Datz: Yeah, I can see that now. Sorry I ever doubted ya. Phoenix: So, what are you doing here, anyway? Datz: I came to get the secret hideout key from a helper. Phoenix: A secret hideout? Datz: Yep. I was supposed to get my next order from Dhurke there. But the town's swarming with cops thanks to that murder. Nothing I can do about that. Phoenix: What about the order Dhurke was supposed to give you? Datz: Gonna have to abort that mission. Now I'm just lying low, waiting for a chance to make contact with Dhurke again. .........Hey, why the long face? Phoenix: I thought you'd be able to tell me something about the high priest's murder. Datz: Sorry to disappoint ya... Oh, I know. Lemme make it up to ya with this. Phoenix: ...What is it? Datz: This orb is actually a key. It opens the door to one of our secret hideouts. I can't say any more than that. Anyway, I hope it helps. Phoenix: This orb... is a key? Datz: Yep! Plus the hideout's in a totally unexpected location! And being that it's super secret, we couldn't have just any ordinary key! Phoenix: I see... Golden Orb added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Maybe this will help me unravel the truth behind this case. Thanks! Datz: Don't mention it! Besides, you're a fellow brother in arms, fighting the powers that be! If it'll help ya, feel free to pick my brain a bit more. Lady Kee'ra (appears after \"Mr. Are'bal's plan\") Datz: Everyone's been talking about the return of Lady Kee'ra lately. Phoenix: Well, my friend Maya's suspected of being the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra. You wouldn't happen to know who she really is though, would you?! Datz: Beats me. But whoever she is, she bushwhacked me and hauled me off to jail! Even worse, on top o' attacking us and delivering us to the cops... ...she's been watching us like a hawk and framing us for different crimes! Phoenix: Watching you like a hawk? Framing you for crimes? Why would anyone go to all that trouble? Datz: Our kingdom likes to pretend that its people are free to think what they want. Because of that, the authorities can't arrest ya just for sympathizing with the rebellion. So they resort to framing people for things they didn't do. Phoenix: Then that Lady Kee'ra figure is... Datz: Yep, she's just some lickspittle working for the Ga'ran regime. Phoenix: Wow... Inga: Heh, even without the DC Act, Dhurke and his insurgent scum buddies' days are numbered. Phoenix: Wh-What's that supposed to mean?! Inga: Let's just say... I got a little trick up my sleeve. So I'd watch it if I were you. 'Cause you got a defiant attitude -- like one o' them dragon dupes. Phoenix: (So he was talking about Lady Kee'ra, then?) Datz: Advanced combat skills, detailed surveillance, and clever set ups... She's no amateur if ya ask me. Phoenix: So, you're saying the monarchy is using Lady Kee'ra to secretly take out the rebels? Datz: Exactly! The Ga'ran regime is using her to control the people, even down to what we think! Phoenix: Why don't the people protest if the monarchy is doing things like that? Datz: Unfortunately, we don't have any conclusive evidence. And without that, we can't prove anything. Phoenix: Arngh! I know the feeling... If I bring this up in court, they'd probably dismiss it out of hand. (I'll have to unmask Lady Kee'ra if I want to get anywhere.) Goal of the revolution (appears after \"Lady Kee'ra\") Leads to: \"Our goal? To get rid o' that evil, no-good Defense Culpability Act!\" Present Attorney's Badge Datz: I've seen the will of the dragon within ya! You're gonna make a fine rebel! Phoenix: What?! Datz: What's wrong, my friend! You've gotta rise up with me! Har har har har har! Phoenix: Um... I don't recall joining the rebellion, though... Tahrust's Autopsy Report, Inner Sanctum Photo, Nahmanda Flower, or Family Photo Datz: The high priest left Lady Inmee all alone when he died. Even worse, they say she's expecting a baby. Phoenix: It's always hardest for the family members left behind. Datz: I know exactly what you mean. Blast it! If only I could remember what happened after I escaped from prison. Phoenix: (It seems Mr. Are'bal feels responsible for the high priest's death.) Dhurke's Law Book Datz: The dragon emblem branded into that book is a sign of defiance against the Ga'ran regime. That evil law's led to the deaths of many of our brothers in arms. Phoenix: You mean the Defense Culpability Act? Datz: Yep. But we're not gonna stand for it much longer! That's the main reason we have to see this revolution through! Phoenix: (I've never seen him so serious before.) Golden Orb Datz: That orb's the key to the secret hideout. Phoenix: So, where exactly is this hideout, anyway? Datz: Umm............ Phoenix: Don't tell me you forgot when you bumped your head? Datz: .........Har har har har har! Phoenix: (Looks like I'll have to find it myself.) Anything else Datz: Hmm... This is that whatchamacallit, ain't it. Phoenix: What is? Datz: You know, that whatchamacallit. Um... What were we talking about again? Phoenix: It's all right. You don't have to force yourself if you've got nothing to say... Datz: Our goal? To get rid o' that evil, no-good Defense Culpability Act! Phoenix: I can tell just by looking at Dhurke's law book. Datz: The DC Act has turned this kingdom into a corrupt cesspool... ...where false charges are overlooked, and prosecutors are the only ones heard in court. It's been twenty-three years since it was first enacted. Phoenix: What happened twenty-three years ago to make them pass such a terrible law? Datz: The assassination of Queen Amara... That's where it all began. Ahlbi: It happened before I was even born, but... ...Queen Amara -- the previous queen -- was assassinated. And it was the rebel leader Dhurke who did it. Phoenix: Dhurke assassinated the former queen, didn't he? Datz: That's the official line, but... Phoenix: The official line? Datz: Those charges were completely trumped up! Dhurke was framed, I'm telling ya! Phoenix: H-He was?! Datz: Plus, Dhurke was a lawyer. Once the people thought a lawyer had killed the queen, they turned against all lawyers. And that's how the DC Act was first passed. Phoenix: So, that's why there aren't any lawyers left in Khura'in. Datz: Even worse, it changed the significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance. Phoenix: (The significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance?) They were holding S\u00e9ances in court, even before the DC Act? Datz: You bet they were! Lawyers and prosecutors used to hotly contest the Insights that came outta S\u00e9ances. Phoenix: You mean like what I've been doing? Datz: Right! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence. Phoenix: Right... I see what you mean about the significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance changing. Datz: Yep! The Insights became the only truth, and arguing against them was banned! Rayfa: As royal priestess, it is my duty to reveal the truth through the Divination S\u00e9ance. This time, I will prove that the insights I glean thereof are the very truth itself. Prepare yourself, for this shall be your last trial... and your last rites. Tomorrow shall end with you under the headsman's axe! Phoenix: (From what I've seen, Rayfa would agree with that.) Datz: This kingdom's a shadow of its former self. It's become a dictatorship where the royals use the fear of trumped-up charges to rule! Phoenix: And that's what Dhurke's been rebelling against? Datz: Yep. All we want is to live in a kingdom with a fair and impartial legal system. And there's only one way to make that come true: Overthrow the current regime! Phoenix: (So, that's the truth behind the rebels.) Datz: ...Well, PW, my friend, it's about time for me to get going. After all, I AM the fangs of the Defiant Dragons. Datz Are'bal! Phoenix: You're not going to do that \"alley-oop\" thing again, are you? Datz: I was just getting to that! See ya when I see ya! Alley-oop! Phoenix: (Why does he have to jump like that before running off?) ...Well, I guess we're friends now. But enough about that. I've already spent way too much time here! Tehm'pul Temple, Plaza of Devotion, Inner Sanctum, Detention Center, or High Priest's House (before examining manhole, then presenting Brand New Flag in Khura'in - Bazaar) Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: That patch on the accused's bag... It is the Steel Samurai? Phoenix: Yes. It's a huge hit back in my country. Rayfa: I see... It has a rather fine design, I must say. However, it pales beside the Plumed Punisher, of course. Phoenix: Of course... (They all look the same to me, to be honest...) What to do Rayfa: How dare you leave me behind like that! Phoenix: S-Sorry... (It sure was a lot easier without her, though.) Rayfa: Do that again and I will levy a penalty on you! Phoenix: A penalty? Like what...? Rayfa: Like... Oh, I know! You must clean my room. Phoenix: Hey, that's not so bad. Rayfa: ...All thirty of them. Phoenix: Forgive me for leaving you behind, Your Benevolence! May 11Khura'in - Bazaar Phoenix: Whew... I finally got out of there! Ahlbi: Mr. Wright! I'm so glad you're okay! I was so worried about you! Shah'do: *whine* Phoenix: Shah'do... What happened to him, anyway? Ahlbi: He came out of the manhole about five minutes after you went in. Sorry he wasn't much help! Shah'do: *whine* Rayfa: ...Well? Did you find anything of worth? Phoenix: Oh, uh... I tripped and fell down there. I must've been out cold for a while. (I better keep things to myself for now.) Rayfa: I figured as much. Phoenix: (I have to find that secret hideout Mr. Are'bal was talking about. I should probably start with places that have something to do with the high priest.) Examine Manhole Rayfa: What is it, Barbed Head? Is the sewer calling to you once more? Phoenix: Not exactly... (I probably shouldn't tell her about Mr. Are'bal...) Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: Barbed Head... I detect a foul odor emanating from you. Phoenix: Well, I did walk through the sewers, so... Rayfa: Stay back! Keep your stink to yourself! Phoenix: I'd be glad to leave you alone if you'd like. Rayfa: Who said you could walk away from me, you muttonhead! Phoenix: Fine, I'll stick to you like glue. Rayfa: No, that is too close! Phoenix: (I just can't win with her.) What to do Rayfa: Even after investigating the sewers, you have nothing. Phoenix: Well, I'm not ready to give up yet! (Besides, I wouldn't say I have nothing.) There's nowhere I wouldn't go if it would help Maya! Rayfa: So, what will it be next? Will you dive into a septic tank? Phoenix: Uuh... I-If it would help Maya, I wouldn't rule it out! Rayfa: S-Stay back! Phoenix: I thought it was just a hypothetical! Present Golden Orb Rayfa: That orb has a mesmerizing core. I must take a closer look at it. Phoenix: (Mr. Are'bal entrusted me with this, so maybe I shouldn't let even Princess Rayfa handle it.) Y-Your Benevolence? Wouldn't you be defiled by touching an object that has been in the hands of a lawyer? Rayfa: I suppose so. Phoenix: ...You do know that there are no such things as lawyer cooties, right? May 11Inner Sanctum Rayfa: Barbed Head. You already searched here, did you not? Phoenix: Oh, umm... I just thought I'd look around again. You know, in case I missed something? (I probably shouldn't tell her I'm looking for the secret rebel hideout.) We have a saying back home: \"Leave no stone unturned.\" Rayfa: Hmm? ...Oh, yes. You cannot stump me. I know that one. Phoenix: (Actually, \"I don't have a clue\" is written all over your face...) Examine Prayer flags Phoenix: I can't believe Mr. Are'bal used this as a parachute. Rayfa: That reckless fool... Then again, he must have a screw loose if he counts himself among those vile rebels. Phoenix: (I wouldn't exactly call him crazy... but he's certainly one-of-a-kind.) Left side of warbaa'd statue Phoenix: It's a statue of a bird... Guess I'll take a closer look at it. (Changed from [It's a statue of a bird... I should take a closer look later.] in the original release) Statue's missing eye Leads to: \"Hey, this eye is missing.\" Phoenix: Hey, this eye is missing. Rayfa: What are you doing? You must not touch that for no reason! Phoenix: S-Sorry! But that shape... Hmm, I wonder... Present Golden Orb Phoenix: Leads to: \"I knew it!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This might fit in that cavity. Rayfa: Pohlkunka! Wh-What are you doing?! You... chowderhead! Remove your hand from there this instant! Phoenix: S-Sorry! I just thought this might fit in there. Rayfa: Are you blind?! They have entirely different shapes! Phoenix: (Yeah, that was a long shot. Still, I can't help feeling I have something that would fit in there.) Rayfa: Do not let me catch you needlessly touching the statue again! Phoenix: A-Alright already, I get it... Leads back to: \"But that shape... Hmm, I wonder...\" Phoenix: I knew it! Rayfa: Wh-Wh-Wha...?! ........................ Phoenix: (She must be at a loss for words. And that doesn't happen too often.) Rayfa: ...What is this place?! E-Explain yourself at once, Barbed Head! Phoenix: (I don't think she's ready for the full story...) I don't really know much myself, but... It seems to be a secret rebel hideout. (If I'm shocked there's a secret door here, I imagine that goes double for Rayfa.) Rayfa: A rebel hideout in the Inner Sanctum?! Somebody will pay for this! Phoenix: W-Well for now, I think I'll have a look around. Rayfa: Wait! You must not enter before the police! Phoenix: Don't worry, I won't disturb anything. (Or at least I'll try not to...) Besides, with you watching over me, it should be fine, right? And, uh, you see... Rayfa: ...Fine. Just please stop pleading your case. I can only stand so much lawyerly drivel. But I will be presenting all information gleaned from your efforts here to the police. Phoenix: Of course. Now, shall we? Rayfa: I will go no further. Phoenix: Oh, right. You're not supposed to come in contact with the taint of Lady Kee'ra's battles. Rayfa: Very good, Barbed Head. I commend you for remembering! Phoenix: O-Oh, well thank you! (Wait, why am I thanking her?) Rayfa: I may not be able to enter, but I will allow no misdeeds on your part. I will be watching you like a warbaa'd from the entrance here! Phoenix: I told you I'm not going to do anything! (I better hurry before she changes her mind!) Examine Revolving door Phoenix: (Who'd have guessed a rebel hideout would be at the back of the Inner Sanctum? Then again, the sanctum's not open to the public. What better place to hide away from prying eyes?) May 11Secret Hideout Rayfa: I believe this to be a sacred space that enshrines the source of the spring water. Phoenix: (That makes sense. The rebels must've converted it into a secret hideout. But what about that warbaa'd revolving door? I wonder if that, too, was originally intended to hide and protect this sacred space.) Rayfa: To think those filthy rebels were scheming their schemes in this most sacred space...! It is a desecration upon Khura'inism itself! The Defiant Dragons shall pay for this! Phoenix: (I suppose it's only natural that she'd be upset. But the investigation must go on!) I think I'll start by taking a picture of the place. (Good thing I brought a camera to snap some souvenir shots.) Rayfa: Stop that! You must not take photos here without permission! Phoenix: (Rayfa's really fired up. She's sticking her head in as far as it will go. I guess she won't be \"tainted\" as long as she doesn't touch anything...?) Rebel Hideout Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Now, to search every nook and cranny... Rayfa: Barbed Head! Just because it is hard for me to see your every move... ...do not use that as an excuse to touch and break things! Phoenix: I heard you the first time! (Sheesh...) Examine Banner Rayfa: How dare those filthy insurgents raise their banner amid such a sacred space! Barbed Head! You must burn it at once! Phoenix: ...Um, didn't you tell me not to touch or damage anything? Rayfa: Hmph, this is an exception! Very well, if you will not do it, then I will! Phoenix: But, Your Benevolence, I thought you're not supposed to come in here. Rayfa: Nngrrrrrrr...! Phoenix: (For once, the strange customs of this kingdom are working in my favor.) Hm? (There's something under the banner. A microphone? What's this doing here? Was someone trying to record something with it?) Smaller stone slab Phoenix: A large stone slab... (It's shaped like a magatama. It looks rather unstable. I bet it'd tip over in an earthquake.) Hm? What's that earthy, grass-like smell? Rayfa: It is the smell of the moss that covers the stone. Phoenix: Oh, so this shaggy green stuff is moss... ...Hm? It looks like some of the moss about halfway up has been disturbed. ...I wonder why that is? (One quick touch can't hurt, right...?) Whoa! (The slab's starting to wobble!) Rayfa: What is happening?! What have you done to the sacred space?! Phoenix: N-N-Nothing! (All I did was nudge it a little... I knew it looked unstable. Probably best not to touch it again.) Water or larger stone slab Phoenix: So, this is the water source that supplies the Inner Sanctum's spring. It flows through the channel built into the floor before heading outside. Rayfa: Lady Kee'ra uses this sacred water to wash the taint of battle from her body. Phoenix: It's also not red like the water in the spring. Chart Phoenix: Looks like an order from Dhurke. Rayfa: What's this?! Let me see that! Phoenix: I thought you're not supposed to touch anything in here. Rayfa: This is an exception! Now hand it over! Let's see here... Hmm... ...O Holy Mother! Phoenix: What? What does it say? Rayfa: It is an order intended for that rebel named Datz. It reads... \"After the rite, infiltrate the palace under the guise of returning Lady Kee'ra's costume... ...and search for clues about that incident from twenty-three years ago. --Dhurke\" Phoenix: Twenty-three years ago? He must mean the assassination of Queen Amara. I wonder what the rebels are up to... (It's intriguing and all, but it doesn't seem related to the case at hand.) Rayfa: This will not do! I must warn my mother at once! Phoenix: No need to do that. This order will never be carried out. Lady Kee'ra's costume is still here, and Abbot Inmee is no longer able to aid the rebels. Rayfa: Hmph, I-I knew that! Chart (subsequent times) Rayfa: Is there anything else you would like me to read, Barbed Head? Phoenix: Oh, um, let's see... Uhh... How about this note? Rayfa: Let me see that. Konuuro, zabaas, bahr'bahr, yak, and roux... Wait, this looks familiar! Phoenix: What is it? Some kind of Khura'inist spell? Rayfa: No, it's a recipe for Khura'inese curry. Phoenix: I guess the rebels enjoy a home-cooked meal, just like everyone else. Plumed Punisher poster Phoenix: There's a Plumed Punisher calendar here. Rayfa: Ah, now I understand. The villains in The Plumed Punisher are based on the insurgents. Watching the show must have roused their ire against Lady Kee'ra! Phoenix: (Umm... I doubt that's it.) Plumed Punisher clock Phoenix: Look! Rayfa: What is it, Barbed Head? Phoenix: It's a Plumed Punisher clock! Rayfa: Why, I believe it's... It is a limited-edition promotional item given to fifty lucky viewers! This rare item plays the Plumed Punisher theme song ever hour! H-Hand it over now, Barbed Head! Phoenix: Ah! (She snatched it away from me! No matter what she says, Rayfa is definitely a huge fan.) Rayfa: Hmm... What a fine item. And this switch... If I'm right... Phoenix: (It's the Plumed Punisher theme song...) Rayfa: Yes, now I see! The insurgents who use this room... ...must be Plumed Punisher fans! Phoenix: ...That may be so, but I don't see how it's relevant to this case. Chain Phoenix: The statue door rotates when you pull this chain. Rayfa: I see...Then you must shut the door and destroy its mechanism! That will deprive the insurgents of access to this place! Phoenix: B-But wouldn't that trap me in here? Rayfa: Not to worry! I would come to visit you once a year. Phoenix: (She's actually serious!) Cart or guns Phoenix: Weapons! And lots of them, too. Rayfa: We are lucky we found them before they could be used. Excellent work, Barbed Head! Phoenix: Oh, uh, thanks... (If the rebellion ever happens, I hope it's bloodless.) Bloodstain Phoenix: What's this? A bloodstain...? I should probably try to figure out what happened in here. Hmm... Rayfa: Do not tamper with any evidence before the police arrive! Phoenix: ...The police? Hey, that reminds me. Ema gave me something just for times like these. Ema: I thought it might help your investigation. Here, it's all yours! I wanted to bring you a bunch of other forensic tools... ...but they were confiscated at the airport. Phoenix: (Luminol testing fluid... This actually might come in handy.) Phoenix: (Luminol testing fluid glows in reaction to even the tiniest traces of blood. So it can even detect areas where blood has been wiped up. It might help us figure out what happened in here. Okay, time for science to do its thing! First, let me put these red-tinted glasses on to see the luminol's glow... ...then I just press [A / Space] wherever I want to spray some of the luminol. (Changed from [...then I just touch wherever I want to spray some of the luminol.] in the original release) Areas where there was blood will react by turning blue.) Spray area near where waterway diverges Leads to: Leads to: \"Th-This is a huge bloodstain! Something big must've happened here!\" Phoenix: Th-This is a huge bloodstain! Something big must've happened here! Rayfa: Perhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue. Phoenix: ...There was definitely a lot of blood here. But it's impossible to say much else at this point. I'll just take a picture for now. Oh, right. Luminol reactions don't show up in photos. I'll just have to take some notes. That should do it! (...I didn't notice before, but the bloodstain looks like it was smeared away in one place. Is it because the warbaa'd revolving door passed over it?) Rebel Hideout Photo updated in the Court Record. Bloodstain (subsequent times) Phoenix: That bloodstain on the floor... The luminol showed that it was even bigger than I expected. Something definitely happened here, and it wasn't good. Rayfa: How can you be so sure? Perhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue. Phoenix: True... But there's not much else we can say at this point. After examining banner, smaller stone slab, chart, Plumed Punisher clock, and bloodstain: Phoenix: ...Well, I think that covers about everything here. Ema: Mr. Wright! You shouldn't have come in here before the police! Phoenix: Sorry, but I was in a hurry. I didn't do anything I wasn't supposed to. Her Benevolence can attest to that. Rayfa: It is your fault for being so slow. I expect the police to work faster and more efficiently! Ema: Sorry... Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Have you not already seen enough? Phoenix: I guess it's about time I got back to the temple and go over everything I've learned. May 11Tehm'pul Temple Ahlbi: Welcome back, Mr. Wright! How'd it go? Phoenix: Unfortunately, I didn't find anything conclusive. Ahlbi: N-No way! Rayfa: ...I do not understand, Barbed Head. Phoenix: What don't you understand? Rayfa: Why you did not commit any misdeeds during your investigation. After all, lawyers ply their trade primarily through illicit means and methods. Phoenix: What?! Who told you that? Rayfa: My mother. Are you saying she was wrong? ...No, that cannot be! You must have committed some sort of misdeed right under my nose. Phoenix: (If that were so, she wasted her whole day following me around.) Rayfa: Hm? What is it? ........................ Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has need of me. Phoenix: What's going on? Rayfa: I must go perform a Divination S\u00e9ance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins. Phoenix: I see... Rayfa: .........The third time will be the charm. My insights will finally bring you to your knees tomorrow! And I will teach that neophyte practitioner a lesson! Phoenix: (Looks like the royal priestess is back with a vengeance. She's made a full recovery from when we started the investigation earlier today.) I look forward to seeing you in court, Your Benevolence! Rayfa: Hmph. Your overconfidence will be your downfall. You will not look so confident when I am finished with you tomorrow! Phoenix: Actually... I'm not really looking forward to seeing her tomorrow. Especially without any solid evidence. Ahlbi: Why don't we go over everything you know so far? Phoenix: All right. Hmm, let's see here... Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed during the rite with Lady Kee'ra's dagger. And Maya's fingerprints were found on it. Ahlbi: That doesn't sound very good! Phoenix: I know... It's the very definition of being up a creek without a paddle. The day before his murder, Zeh'lot enjoyed a meal with the high priest, his wife, and Maya. I also learned about spirit channeling here in Khura'in. Ahlbi: None of that sounds very helpful. Phoenix: Oh, but I did hear something interesting. That the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra might be working for the justice minister. Ahlbi: What?! Really?! Our kingdom is supposed to be ruled through faith and laws. We can't allow the people to be controlled by fear and violence! Phoenix: Ahlbi, that sounds like something a rebel might say. Ahlbi: I-It does? But if that Lady Kee'ra really is one of Minister Inga's subordinates... ...that would exonerate Miss Maya! Phoenix: Unfortunately, I have no way of proving it in court. Ahlbi: ...Oh, that's too bad. Phoenix: Oh, I almost forgot about the secret rebel hideout we found at the Inner Sanctum. There was a bloodstain inside. But I don't know if or how it's connected to this case, though. Ahlbi: Wow! A secret room at the Inner Sanctum?! That would be a huge hit with tourists! Phoenix: (This kid really is an entrepreneur at heart.) Ahlbi: ...Er, what I mean is that hideout could be important to your case. Phoenix: Maybe, but it's still too early to tell. Argh... Looks like I'm heading into court without any useful evidence. Ahlbi: We'll just have to pray something appears during tomorrow's trial... Phoenix: Princess Rayfa's Divination S\u00e9ance might be my only hope. There could be some new information in it that might help. Ahlbi: Th-The Divination S\u00e9ance?! But I thought it always works against the accused! Phoenix: ...Not always. Datz: Right! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence. Ahlbi: Really?! I never heard anyone say that before. It's hard to figure you out sometimes, sir. Phoenix: (Divination S\u00e9ances worked both ways before the Defense Culpability Act. It's only now that the people of Khura'in find it strange.) Ahlbi: Um, Mr. Wright? I just wanted to say... good luck tomorrow! Phoenix: Thanks. I can't afford to lose this next one. (I've collected all sorts of information, but I haven't even started connecting the dots. If I could do that, I might have a shot at pulling off a win. Rayfa's Insights will be the deciding factor. It's a huge gamble, but it's all I've got!) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Phoenix: I've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.

I wanted to officially ask you for your help.Phoenix: You got it, Maya! Let's do this. We gotta wrap this up and get back home so you can make your dream show come true. \"The Steel Samurai vs. The Plumed Punisher,\" right?Maya: You bet!Rayfa: You look as if you did not sleep last night, Barbed Head. It is written all over your face. How can you expect to put up a respectable defense like that?Phoenix: I-I'm all fired up, and raring to go! (I guess Maya's not the only one looking exhausted.)Rayfa: ...........................Phoenix: (Hm? Rayfa doesn't seem in the best spirits herself.)Rayfa: Hmph. Go ahead, feign confidence now while you are still able. For I will see to it that your last rites are read to you this day!Phoenix: (Heh, guess it was just my imagination...)Maya: Ready, Nick?Phoenix: Okay, Maya, let's head on in!May 12High Court of Khura'inDay 2Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge: Now then, if everyone is ready...Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Magistry.Nahyuta: The prosecution is ready. Let us begin without further delay.Judge: Oh, no prayers this time, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta: I already offered my prayers for the latest victim during my visit to the crime scene. Being that the accused has already been found guilty of the first murder... ...let us hasten this trial, so we may put this dead lawyer walking out of his misery.Judge: I could not agree more. In yesterday's trial, the accused was already found guilty of murdering the high priest. And today she will be tried for the murder of his disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot. Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your opening statement, if you would.Nahyuta: ...Certainly. The accused has now slain two of the most devout clergymen in Khura'inism. Even the lowest level of Hell -- the Hell of Tickling -- would not be punishment enough.Judge: *gulp* Th-Then... what t-terrible fate awaits her?Nahyuta: Bahlgilpo'kon Hell -- a realm of eternal agony. There she will suffer the endless punishment of ja'gar by the galuun of Puhlmo'ten. Furthermore, Guhljaama--Judge: E-Enough, enough! My blood runs cold at the mere thought that such a terrible place exists.Phoenix: (I was going to ask for a translation, but on second thought, ignorance is bliss.)Judge: N-Now then, please continue, minus the part about the terrible hell awaiting the accused.Nahyuta: As you wish... The victim of this heinous crime was the high priest's disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot. He had been training under the high priest while living at the priest's home.Judge: I had met him a number of times, and he seemed like an earnest young man. How tragic that he met such a terrible end.Nahyuta: The murder occurred at the Plaza of Devotion, during the Purification Rite. It was a bold crime carried out while the plaza was full of the faithful deep in prayer. The Warbaa'd Dagger was found impaled in the victim's upper back. The stabbing caused a spinal cord injury that killed him instantly.Judge: Ah, the Warbaa'd Dagger. Lady Kee'ra's weapon of choice.Nahyuta: We have already established that the accused's prints were on the weapon. Incredibly damning evidence in itself.Maya: N-No... I didn't do it!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Hold your tongue. Now, being that the accused, Maya Fey, is a serial killer... ...the prosecution believes that the death penalty is the only possible sentence.Judge: Would the defense care to respond?Phoenix: The accused is innocent, and nothing can convince me otherwise! After all, the crime scene was packed with worshippers. How could my client possibly have committed this murder without a single witness?Nahyuta: The accused's fingerprints on the murder weapon alone is enough to render a verdict. As such, I see no need to debate this any further.Phoenix: B-But...!Judge: Well, once Her Benevolence conducts her S\u00e9ance, it will be clear for all to see.Nahyuta: ............... Your Magistry, might I have a word?Judge: Hm? Is something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta: It is about the Divination S\u00e9ance...Rayfa:Judge: Y-Your Benevolence!Rayfa: Stop right there, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.Nahyuta: ...As you wish. Forgive me for overstepping my bounds.Phoenix: (What was that all about?)Rayfa: Barbed Head, have you made peace with your fate? For this time, the Divination S\u00e9ance will bring you to your knees!Phoenix: I'm ready. And I accept your challenge. (The only problem is, I have no weapons at my disposal. Our only hope now is what we can glean from the S\u00e9ance vision and Rayfa's Insights.)Judge: Very well. The Divination S\u00e9ance if you please, Your Benevolence.Rayfa: Yes, let us begin. ...Nayna! O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination S\u00e9ance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!Rayfa: ............Phoenix: ............Judge: ............Phoenix:  (I don't get it. Why wasn't there anything to see?)Judge: Y-Your Benevolence! What in the world...?Rayfa: Urgh... I was unable to evoke any sort of response. I called out the spirit's name many times... but to no avail!Nahyuta: Just as I thought...Phoenix: (Wait, what does he know that we don't?)Nahyuta: I had sought to confirm the contents of today's Divination S\u00e9ance. After all, it is customary for the prosecutor to verify it beforehand.Phoenix: (Come to think of it...)Rayfa: I must go perform a Divination S\u00e9ance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins.Nahyuta: And that is why I sought to stop Her Benevolence from performing it here. However, she insisted that it be done. She wished to try one more time here in the Hall of Justice.Judge: It would appear Her Benevolence is tired from her manifold duties.Rayfa: I am not anything of the sort! The victim's spirit will not answer my call, but I know not why! It is my sacred duty to convey the truth through the Divination S\u00e9ance!Phoenix: (Rayfa...)Judge: What are we to do without a Divination S\u00e9ance?Nahyuta: I suppose I shall have to deliver the last rites without them. The prosecution has already taken that into account when preparing for today. I am fully capable of proving the accused's guilt, with or without a Divination S\u00e9ance.Judge: Ha ha ha ha ha! You never fail to impress, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.Phoenix: (This is bad... The Divination S\u00e9ance was my one and only hope.) Your Magistry, Her Benevolence said she isn't tired! So, shouldn't we try to find out why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed?Rayfa: !Judge: How curious, Mr. Wright. Why have you suddenly taken such a keen interest in the Divination S\u00e9ance?Rayfa: Yes, explain yourself! The Divination S\u00e9ance is for shedding light on an accused's crimes! It is the Holy Mother's hammer of wrath, that is ever poised to pound you into your grave! You should fear it, not plead for it!Phoenix: ...I believe in my client. Plus, yesterday, somebody told me something that changed my mind: The Divination S\u00e9ance was once thought of as just another piece of evidence. If we were to correctly interpret the visions through careful analysis... ...then they would lead us to the truth behind what really happened. And the truth will show that my client, Maya Fey, is innocent.Maya: The truth is, you don't have anything else to fall back on, huh, Nick?Phoenix: ...Maya, please, you're not helping.Rayfa: How dare you?! The voice of a mitamah is to be feared, not utilized by vile lawyers such as you!Nahyuta: S\u00e9ances exact a heavy toll upon the royal priestess. It would be best not to burden her any further. Or does the defense feel that it can pose no counterarguments without the S\u00e9ance?Phoenix: N-No, of course not! (He saw right through me! I'll have to find a way to make the Divination S\u00e9ance happen, or we're toast.)Judge: Well, since the Divination S\u00e9ance is not possible at this time, I see no other choice. Let us proceed with the trial without the S\u00e9ance, as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi suggested.Nahyuta: Thank you, Your Magistry.Rayfa: Why you...! I will not forget this, Barbed Head! This will NOT be the last you see of me!Nahyuta: Now then, I will now proceed by providing an outline of the case at hand.Judge: Very well. If the lead detective would please come to the stand, we may begin.Ema: ........................ ...Sorry, Mr. Wright.Nahyuta: Detective Skye... I understand how you would wish to save the accused and the defense. They are your friends, after all. But you must let them go... and move on.Ema: B-But...!Nahyuta: There is only one way to save them now: By giving their souls the chance to burn away the taint of their sins in the infernal flames.Ema: Ooh... I... I... I can't do this!Judge: Ah! No eating in the sacred Hall of Justice!Maya: Ms. Skye!Ema: Y-Yes?!Maya: Don't worry about me and Nick. You just do your job. I'm sure Nick will figure something out... eventually!Ema: ............... Right. Thanks, Ms. Fey.Nahyuta: How very brave for a criminal with a tainted soul. Very well, Detective Skye. Please proceed.Ema: Okay, I can do this... Let me start with an overview of this case.Witness Testimony-- Overview of the Second Murder --Ema: The latest victim was Puhray Zeh'lot. He had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years. The high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body. He may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.Judge: I see... Well, that certainly makes sense. Would the defense care to respond?Phoenix: (I didn't spot any inconsistencies in her testimony so far. And I don't have any evidence in my arsenal. What am I going to do now?)Maya: Hmm...Phoenix: What is it, Maya?Maya: I was just wondering about how much the police actually looked into Acolyte Zeh'lot. Because it just might prove to be the key as to why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed.Phoenix: What are you getting at?Maya: Umm, well... It's just a hunch.Phoenix: (Wait a second. During my investigation... ...Rayfa told me about how the Divination S\u00e9ance works. If I could figure out why it failed... ...maybe she could try it again. Okay! Time to press for some more information!)Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- Overview of the Second Murder --Ema: The latest victim was Puhray Zeh'lot.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of person was Acolyte Zeh'lot? Ema: According to the neighbors and others who knew him... ...he was a deeply devout youth. Nahyuta: I, too, have heard his name mentioned as one who was a fervent practitioner. I suppose you might say he was the high priest's star disciple. Ema: Furthermore...Ema: He had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Two years? Are you sure about that? Ema: We took statements from his neighbors and his fellow monks. They all corroborate our initial findings. Phoenix: What about you, Maya? Maya: ...Well, when I first came here... ...I saw Zeh'lot praying under the high priest's instruction. Phoenix: I see... So the results of the police investigation seem to check out...Ema: The high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was Mrs. Inmee's positive ID the only way you verified the identity of the victim? Ema: Huh? ...Well, no! We also checked the ID card he carried and the data in his family registry. But... Phoenix: But what? Ema: His personal information didn't match any of the public records we cross-referenced. Phoenix: Maybe that's why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed. Ema: I-I'm not sure what you mean, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Here's what I'm thinking... His address was wrong Phoenix: The victim's address was wrong! Ema: Um... Mr. Wright? Even if it was wrong, how would that affect the Divination S\u00e9ance? Phoenix: Oh, uhh... You're right. It wouldn't. (What was it that a Divination S\u00e9ance required, again? Oh, right! Then there is only one possible answer!) Ema: It looks like the fact that his personal info wasn't in the public records isn't important. Phoenix: No, Ema, it is important. Leads to: \"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason...\" Puhray Zeh'lot is a fake name Leads to: \"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason...\" Phoenix: The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason... In other words, he was using a fake name! The royal priestess uses a deceased's face and true name to summon their spirit. Rayfa: Why, yes, that is indeed true. Nahyuta: If he was using a forged ID and there is no mention of him in our public records... ...then he was likely an illegal immigrant. They are not uncommon here in Khura'in. Phoenix: An illegal immigrant? (Come to think of it, Rayfa mentioned something about immigrants yesterday.) Ema: But if that's the case, we have no way of knowing who he really is. We'll have to proceed without holding a Divination S\u00e9ance this time. Phoenix: Urk! Judge: I had always thought that Acolyte Zeh'lot was Khura'inese. Oh, how the high priest must be lamenting his disciple's deception in the Twilight Realm. Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think? Should we add this to the testimony? Add it to the testimony Phoenix: This is an important fact. Please add it to the testimony. Judge: Hmm... It would seem to be a fact most inconvenient for the defense. But, if you insist. Detective Skye, please add what you just said to your testimony. Ema: Yes, Your Magistry. Adds statement \"He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.\" Don't add it to the testimony Phoenix: No, Your Magistry. There's no need to add it to her testimony. Judge: Very well, then. Please continue if you would, Detective Skye. Ema: Yes, Your Magistry. We still don't know the victim's true identity, but... Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: But the victim was using a fake name, so... ...he may very well have been in Khura'in illegally. Ema: Y-Yes, that's very likely the case. Phoenix: (Now that I have an opening, what next? It's still not going to help me learn Zeh'lot's true identity. Was he really an illegal alien?)Ema: He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Isn't there some way to track down his real name? Ema: No, not if he was an illegal immigrant. Phoenix: Have you actually confirmed that he was in Khura'in illegally? Ema: Well, we don't have any conclusive evidence. But there's also no evidence of him being a citizen of Khura'in, either. Phoenix: Hoh boy... Now what do we do... Maya: What if there was a clue in the evidence you gathered? Phoenix: That's probably our only hope at this point. (If he really was an illegal immigrant, our proverbial goose is probably cooked.)Present Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Sorry, Detective Skye...\"Ema: He may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya isn't that Lady Kee'ra who's been going around capturing rebels! Ema: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright, but...  Nahyuta: Nahyuta: That verdict was already handed down in the previous trial. It is no longer a point of dispute, and I will not allow you to make it so. Phoenix: But...! Nahyuta: No \"ifs,\" \"ands,\" and most of all, no \"buts.\" The accused was posing as Lady Kee'ra. And she killed Acolyte Zeh'lot because she mistakenly believed him to be a rebel. Maya: Th-That's not true! Ema: I'm sorry... The verdict has already been read in that case. I have to assume that it's fact now. Phoenix: Arngh!Before adding statement Phoenix: Maya, you mentioned that Ema's testimony might hold a clue as to why the S\u00e9ance failed. Maya: I did, but it's really just a hunch. Phoenix: (That might mean there was a mistake made during the investigation. It would have to be information that would impact the S\u00e9ance. Hmm, what could it be...?)After adding statement Phoenix: (Now I know why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed, but...) Maya: Umm, nothing's really changed. Phoenix: Yeah, which means we're in big trouble. Maya: If he really was an illegal immigrant, it's going to be real hard to find out his real name... Phoenix: (I guess our only choice is to give up on the whole Divination S\u00e9ance thing. If only there was some way to find out the victim's real name...)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Ahlbi Ur'gaid\nDescription: My guide.

The evidence list includes the Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) which mentions a peach-shaped tattoo on his neck. In the game, that tattoo is actually a mark of the royal family, indicating he's not a rebel but related to the queen. So if Ema's testimony claims he was mistaken for a rebel, the evidence showing his royal tattoo contradicts that because it proves his true identity as part of the royal family, not a rebel."

A major change like that could very well produce a contradiction. I should take another look at the Inner Sanctum diagram in the Court Record... ...and confirm where Maya and Abbot Inmee were standing. And then focus on finding any discrepancies between their positions and the Insights.) The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra. As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly... ...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the spring-side lantern. Present lantern (Sight) on fourth panel Phoenix: Leads to: \"Your Benevolence... I've found a new contradiction.\" It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed. As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world. Phoenix: Your Benevolence... I've found a new contradiction. Rayfa: You... You did? Hmph. No doubt it is but another of your vile attempts to slander my Insights. Phoenix: Nope. Take a good look at what the victim saw. It just might change your mind. The lantern flame behind the accused was flickering. Rayfa: There is nothing unusual about that. Especially as the wind had stirred. Phoenix: No, that's where you're wrong. If the accused had been standing in the spring... ...then what you see here should be one of the lanterns flanking the statue. Rayfa: I fail to see your point. Phoenix: My point is, something is wrong here. The two lanterns flanking the statue were both outfitted with glass wind guards. So neither lantern's flame should have been flickering in the wind in the first place! Rayfa: ........................Heh. Maya: She seems pretty tickled, Nick! Phoenix: I don't remember saying anything funny. Rayfa: I fail to see what you wish to prove here, but... very well. I shall refine the vision and reveal the truth for all to see. O blessed mitamah, I beseech you! Fix your sight upon the lantern there. S\u00c9ANCE VISION REFINED Phoenix: H-Huh? That lantern doesn't have a wind guard on it. Rayfa: And rightly so. For the wind guard was removed to reveal the sacred flame within for the Rite of Fire. Therefore, there is nothing odd about the flame flickering. Phoenix: S-Say whaaat?! B-But when we searched the crime scene, those lanterns had their wind guards on! Nahyuta: That's because the police put them back on. The sacred flames have burned uninterrupted for hundreds of years, defense. We could not risk them being extinguished, even during an investigation. Phoenix: Th-That would never fly back home... Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Are you done quibbling? If so, then it is time to bow down before this testimony of the mitamah! Phoenix: .........Arnghk! Maya: Nick...! Phoenix: ...Don't worry, Maya! I'm just getting started! (All right, let's go over everything we know so far. Maya was wearing Lady Kee'ra's robes and standing in the spring. The high priest is thought to have been moving toward her. So I should look for sensations that stand in contradiction to this arrangement. I won't give up! I'm going to find a contradiction that will undermine the accusation against Maya!) The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra. As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly... ...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the spring-side lantern. Present broken lantern (Sight) on second panel Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wh-What could this possibly mean?\" It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed. As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world. Phoenix: (Wh-What could this possibly mean? That lantern clearly contradicts the Insight... But this contradiction... ...will overturn the entire case I've been building.) Judge: Are you all right, Mr. Wright? One minute you shout out, and in the next, you fall silent. Rayfa: Perhaps it is like the bellow of one who is barreling down a hill with no way of stopping. Is that not right, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: .................. Phoenix: (Don't get cold feet now, Phoenix. Even if this overturns the entire case you've built so far... ...the only way is to keep moving forward -- because that's where we'll find the truth!) ...Sorry, but I'm not barreling down a hill. In fact, I'm in full control of everything with the indisputable contradiction I found! Rayfa: Is that so? Phoenix: The lantern behind the accused clearly-- No, BLATANTLY contradicts your Insight! Rayfa: Does it now...? Phoenix: One of the lanterns on the entrance side of the Inner Sanctum was broken. And if you watch what Abbot Inmee saw in his final moments... ...you will notice that the lantern behind the praying form of Ms. Fey is broken. The lantern behind Lady Kee'ra, however, is still intact. In short, we are seeing two different lanterns in this S\u00e9ance vision! Rayfa: H-How could this be?! And even if it were so, how would that contradict my Insights?! Phoenix: .................. Let me start by saying, the claim I'm about to raise... ...will overturn the case I've built thus far. Judge: Will the defense please explain himself? Phoenix: Based on the broken lantern, we can tell... Maya and Abbot Inmee's positions Leads to: \"Where the accused and the victim were standing!\" The lanterns positions Phoenix: The correct position of the lanterns! Rayfa: But did you not just explain that yourself? Phoenix: Oh, did I? Judge: The defense will own up to its own statements! Phoenix: (I'd better stop filling His Magistry's anger meter...) Judge: The fact that there was a broken lantern does not change anything. Phoenix: I beg to differ, Your Magistry! There is one thing it makes clear. And that is... Leads to: \"Where the accused and the victim were standing!\" Phoenix: Where the accused and the victim were standing! Judge: But did you not just finish asserting that the accused was standing somewhere else?! Phoenix: I did. And I built my argument on that faulty premise. But thankfully, it has led us here... ...to the actual spot where Maya Fey was standing! Judge: I must say, if the defense keeps changing its assertions in such a capricious manner... ...its credibility may come into question. Phoenix: I'm willing to take that risk, Your Magistry, because I believe this will be the last time. I'd like to start by pointing out the actual spot where the accused was standing. Judge: Very well... Show us where you now believe the accused was actually standing. Phoenix: (Based on the location of the broken lantern, where was Maya really standing?) Present area between southern lanterns Phoenix: Leads to: \"I wasn't thinking straight before, but now it's all falling into place.\" Present anywhere else Judge: Hmm... And you are sure it was there? Phoenix: Oh, uh, my hand slipped. Sorry, can we just say that one didn't count? Judge: Counting such baffling gaffes is my job, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Well, it was worth a try... (I need to think about the location of the broken lantern. That should make the spot where Maya was standing more than apparent!) Judge: O Holy Mother of Khura'in, Mr. Wright! You remind us yet again why lawyers are reviled. This time, see that you point out where the accused was really standing. Leads back to: \"Based on the location of the broken lantern, where was Maya really standing?\" Phoenix: I wasn't thinking straight before, but now it's all falling into place. We know the victim had stepped into the spring. That means Maya Fey had to have been standing in the water as he approached. However, his memory, which has only now become clear, reveals that... ...Ms. Fey was standing by the side of the broken lantern. In other words... ...she was standing where she was supposed to be according to custom. Rayfa: Rayfa: Does that not bring us back to the very beginning?! Phoenix: No, this is where things take a different turn -- and I mean that literally. The victim had to have been moving toward the spring. That means that while he was moving, he had his back turned toward the accused! Rayfa: What's this?! Do you mean to say the victim turned around during the rite?! But such an image appears nowhere in the S\u00e9ance vision! Phoenix: Actually, it does appear. It's just that no one noticed until now. Judge: N-No one noticed?! How could no one have noticed something so big?! Phoenix: There was a moment when the scripture the victim was holding was all we could see. Thanks to that, none of us could tell that he was, in fact, turning around in that moment. Rayfa: ...Nngh! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: If it is as the defense asserts, then Her Benevolence's Insights no longer make sense. How do you intend to explain that? Phoenix: Phoenix: I don't need to explain anything, because it's just as you said, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Her Benevolence's Insights DON'T make any sense because they contain a huge error! Rayfa: ...S-Such insolence! Judge: A huge error, you say? Do explain. Phoenix: The huge error is... The order of the rites Phoenix: The order in which the smaller rites were performed is all wrong! But there's only one way to tell. So let's ask for confirmation from someone who was actually there. Well, Maya? Maya: Sorry, Nick... I was out cold, so I don't remember a thing. Judge: ...It seems there is no way to know. Phoenix: (Nngh...) Judge: But what I'm wondering is... ...what does the order of the rites have to do with this case in the first place? Phoenix: ............Truth be told, I hadn't considered that yet. Judge: Consider the meaning behind this penalty, then! Phoenix: Consider it done, Your Magistry... Your Magistry! Please give me another chance! Judge: ...Very well. But do not test my patience any further. Now, tell me. What is the huge error in Her Benevolence's Insights? Leads back to: \"The huge error is...\" The crime scene Phoenix: The scene of the crime is wrong! Rayfa: But the vision clearly shows that Abbot Inmee was murdered at the Inner Sanctum! Phoenix: Could there be another place that looks just like it? Judge: ...No, there can't. Phoenix: (Agh. If that's not it, then...) Your Magistry! Please give me another chance! Judge: ...Very well. But do not test my patience any further. Now, tell me. What is the huge error in Her Benevolence's Insights? Leads back to: \"The huge error is...\" The number of people there Leads to: \"I believe this is what happened at the scene of the crime:\" Phoenix: I believe this is what happened at the scene of the crime: The victim was reading a sutra when suddenly, he sensed someone behind him. He immediately looked back to see someone dressed as Lady Kee'ra standing there. Wishing to see who it was, he approached the robed figure. That's when he was stabbed! Rayfa: This cannot be! Phoenix: Oh, but it can. And it is! The Insight stating the accused stabbed the victim is wrong! And that is the real truth lying behind this testimony of the dead! Rayfa: Po... Judge: Po... Nahyuta: Po... Rayfa: Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Judge: A- Are you suggesting... ...that there was someone else at the scene of the crime?! Rayfa: Hnnnnnngh! Have I misunderstood... the voice of the mitamah... yet again? ...Th-This--! This cannot be! Phoenix: (Whew... That was a close one. But I managed to divine the true meaning behind the S\u00e9ance vision somehow. I should add these new facts to the Court Record.) Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record. Nahyuta: Your Benevolence, please allow me to take it from here. I will overturn the brash accusations of this faithless, putrid-minded lawyer. Rayfa: Y-Yes... I shall place my trust in you. Judge: Are you sure about this, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: My work as an international prosecutor has taken me to courtrooms around the world. And in that time, I have learned to perform last rites for souls in trials lacking a S\u00e9ance. Judge: Yes, of course. Forgive my ludicrous inquiry. Nahyuta: Moreover, I have with me a forensic investigator from overseas. I will show you all the most magnificent last rites ever seen. Phoenix: (I guess he really does think highly of Ema and her forensic expertise. I'm impressed that he's come to understand their value. Then again... ...he IS an international prosecutor who's solved tough cases around the world. Time to hunker down, huh...) Judge: Now then, let us continue with today's proceedings. Could the defense please tell us who the third party dressed as Lady Kee'ra was? Your new claim has negated the Insights of the royal priestess... ...so I trust you have some evidence to support it, correct? Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. (This third party must have really wanted to kill the high priest. I might be able to identify who it was if I had evidence of their murderous intent!) Judge: Well, we're waiting, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: The evidence that can reveal the identity of the third party... is this! Present Lady Kee'ra's Warning Phoenix: Leads to: \"Three days before the Purification Rite...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This piece of evidence tells us who the third party is! Nahyuta: Ah, yes. I suppose this evidence does clearly demonstrate one thing: The fact that you are lowlier than the lowliest of worms, that is. Judge: Even a lawyer like you cannot not worm your way out of this one, defense. Phoenix: Nngh, talk about opening up a can of worms... Your Magistry, I'd like to present another piece of evidence! Judge: Well, it seems the worm is not without a spine. Very well. What other evidence do you have for us today? Leads back to: \"The evidence that can reveal the identity of the third party... is this!\" Phoenix: Three days before the Purification Rite... ...the victim received a warning letter from an unidentified individual! Judge: He did?! Phoenix: Whoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, \"Do not perform the rite.\" But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered. Judge: Who do you suppose sent that letter? Phoenix: A person with something to hide -- the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra herself! Judge: Peace! I-I... I don't understand. I had heard the Lady Kee'ra that has been in the news of late only hunted rebels. If so, why would she have killed the high priest? Phoenix: Excellent question. Maybe it would help to think of it this way: What if the high priest... had secretly been a rebel?! Gallery: The high priest?! He couldn't possibly have been a rebel! Judge: The high priest -- a devout follower of Khura'inism... a rebel?! Do you even comprehend the blasphemy of which you speak? Well? DO YOU?! Phoenix: I, too, found it hard to believe at first. But as I continued my investigation, it started to become more and more plausible. Nahyuta: Nahyuta: The third party was the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra? And the high priest was a rebel? Your mockery of Khura'inism... No... ...of the Kingdom of Khura'in itself knows no bounds! Phoenix: (Whoops.) Gallery: That shameless pohlkunan lawyer...He's making a mockery of our religion! Judge: ...As a faithful Khura'inist, I take issue with these claims. And I am loath to admit them into today's proceedings. Phoenix: (I don't like where this is going.) Nahyuta: The defense's claims are but vile blasphemy tantamount to spitting on the Holy Mother. Phoenix: I-Is it really that big of a deal, Maya...? Maya: Abbot Inmee was a distinguished monk, and very well-respected, too, so... yeah. Phoenix: (Ugh... Please don't let this turn into an international incident...) Nahyuta: But fear not, good people of Khura'in. The rantings of this putrid-brained lawyer who seeks to sully the soul of the deceased... ...shall come to no avail once I conclude these last rites. The prosecution's assertion that the accused killed the victim remains unchanged. Phoenix: B-But...the victim was stabbed in his abdomen! How is that possible when he had his back turned toward Ms. Fey?! Someone else must have killed him! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Are you sure about that? You may have invalidated the S\u00e9ance, but do not let it go to your putrid head. The karmic flow of this trial is, as yet, still in my hands. Phoenix: (How can he be so confident?) Nahyuta: Heh heh heh... Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a deluded fantasy. And I shall prove that by calling a new witness to the stand. ...An eyewitness who will deliver a definitive answer that will dispel the defense's doubts. Phoenix: A-An eyewitness...? Judge: Very well. Let us call this eyewitness to the stand. Phoenix: (It's him again!) Judge: Well, now... He has to be the shaggiest witness I have ever laid eyes upon. Please state your name and occupation. ???: Oh, um... I'm, ya know, that so-and-so, whatchamacallit! A'nohn Ihmus TBD! 'Least that's what they've been calling me! Judge: \"TBD\"? As in \"to be determined\"? Can't you just tell us your real name? Nahyuta: The witness has suffered a blow to the head, rendering him amnesiac. Therefore... ...I named him \"A'nohn Ihmus (TBD)\" in my report, but he thinks \"TBD\" is part of his name. Phoenix: Phoenix: You're letting an amnesiac testify?! Nahyuta: Have no fear. I have already questioned him at length. While it is true he has utterly forgotten his name and past... ...his memory of what he witnessed is still very much intact. Judge: Considering the dearth of information, any new knowledge may be of help. Therefore, I will permit his testimony. Now, Mr. Ihmus, please tell us what you saw. Ihmus: .................. Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder -- Ihmus: That night, I was up at the top of Mt. Poniponi, the mountain next to the Inner Sanctum. I hate crowds, so I climbed up there to pray in peace. I know it's a no-no, but since there was no one around... ...I used my binoculars to spy on the rite at the Inner Sanctum. That's when I saw the accused... stab the high priest with a dagger! Phoenix: There's no way you saw Ms. Fey stab the victim with a dagger! Maya: I-I swear I don't know what he's talking about! ...Or don't remember, at any rate! Judge: Mt. Poniponi... the beautiful mountain that is also known as the Little Sanctum. Phoenix: (They must be talking about that smaller mountain from the poster...) Judge: Mr. Ihmus, I was wondering... Ihmus: What can I do ya for? Judge: The Inner Sanctum lies at a high elevation where clouds and fog can obscure the view. Are you sure you were able to see what happened from the mountaintop next to it? Phoenix: (Good point!) H-His Magistry raises an excellent question! Well, Mr. Ihmus?! Ihmus: On the day of the rite, there wasn't a cloud in the sky! I had a perfect view! If ya don't believe me, check the weather forecast in the paper that day! Maya: Nick! Don't we have the newspaper for that day?! Phoenix: Yeah, let's take a look. Hmm... It does say calm, clear skies, doesn't it? Ihmus: See? Told ya so! May 9th Newspaper updated in the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... Well, it would appear the witness has offered testimony worth hearing. Nahyuta: ...Mr. Ihmus. I, too, have a question for you. Phoenix: (Didn't he already question the witness?) Ihmus: Well, that's what I'm here for, right? Shoot! Nahyuta: How was the accused holding the dagger? Was she holding it underhanded, its blade protruding from the bottom of her hand? Ihmus: Yep, I believe she was! It's called a reverse grip! Nahyuta: Ah... I thought as much. Phoenix: Phoenix: Hold it right there! What bearing does that have on this case? Nahyuta: Cease your interruptions, you putrid-headed lawyer. Do you not see the significance in how the blade was held? Phoenix: Why don't you enlighten me, O enlightened one? Nahyuta: Feh. I knew you were a fool. I can already picture you in your next life. Phoenix: N-Next life...? Nahyuta: Yes... After your soul writhes for centuries in the pits of hell... ...you shall be reborn as a witless sea urchin, with barbs limited to your posterior. You shall live a short, inconsequential life, only to be brutally devoured by a sea otter. Phoenix: (That was a bit excessive. I simply asked what the dagger grip had to do with the case.) Nahyuta: Now, pay attention. How the accused held the dagger is of vital importance. With such information, we can infer exactly what actions she took. You were saying that the victim was killed while he had his back to the accused. Is that correct? Phoenix: Y-Yes... Nahyuta: As such, the accused's dagger grip tells us something very important: The accused approached the victim from behind, swung her arms around him... ...and plunged the dagger deep into his abdomen, using a reverse grip! Phoenix: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Nahyuta: Thus, Mr. Ihmus's testimony clears up any doubts that might remain. Judge: Ha ha ha! And it coincides with Her Benevolence's Insights as well! Phoenix: (This is a disaster! I thought I'd blown those Insights out of the water, but now they're back to haunt me!) Judge: Now then, the defense may cross-examine the witness. Cross-Examination -- The Night of the Murder -- Ihmus: That night, I was up at the top of Mt. Poniponi, the mountain next to the Inner Sanctum. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure you're not mistaken, Mr. Ihmus? Was it really Mt. Poniponi that you climbed? Ihmus: Oh, I'm sure of it! It was a really poniponi-ish mountain! Phoenix: (What does that even mean?) Ihmus: Ya know, now that I think about it, it was a mighty fine view! Ihmus: I hate crowds, so I climbed up there to pray in peace Press Phoenix: Phoenix: If you hate crowds, why bother climbing to the top? Couldn't you have just as easily prayed at the bottom of Mt. Poniponi? Ihmus: Wrong, bucko! This is a once-a-year, epic event! I wanted to pray as close to the actual thing as possible! Phoenix: If you're so gung-ho about it, why didn't you go pray at the Plaza of Devotion? Ihmus: Like I said, I hate crowds. I wanted to pray in peace! Phoenix: (O Holy Mother, why do I only get the annoying ones...?) Ihmus: And my burning faith demanded that I climb up the mountain closest to the Inner Sanctum! Also... Ihmus: I know it's a no-no, but since there was no one around... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Since nobody was around... ...there is nobody who can corroborate your actions, either. Ihmus: Hee-HO! Y-You're exactly right! Phoenix: In that case, Mr. Ihmus, let me ask you this: Was there a reason you didn't want to be seen? Ihmus: Uh... About that... If ya get caught climbing the surrounding mountains on the day o' the rite... ...ya can get in big, big trouble!  Har har har har har! Phoenix: ...Th-That's it? Ihmus: Yeah, it's totally embarrassing getting yelled at when you're a grown-up! Har har har har har! Phoenix: Yeah, you're a real \"grown-up,\" all right... Ihmus: And since nobody was around, I lost all inhibition and... Ihmus: ...I used my binoculars to spy on the rite at the Inner Sanctum. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You had a pair of binoculars with you? That's pretty convenient. You weren't planning to spy on the rite all along, were you? Ihmus: A-Actually, I just happened to have 'em for bird watching. Phoenix: Bird watching, huh...? I see. Maya: You're not going to keep pressing him on this? Phoenix: He's sketchy as heck, but I don't really have anything I can really sink my teeth into yet. Maya: Oh... okay then. Ihmus: Haaar har har har har! I love the great outdoors! That's just the kinda guy I am! A guy called... A'nohn Ihmus TBD! Phoenix: .................. Maya: H-He's... really starting to get on my nerves. Ihmus: As I looked through my binoculars, I couldn't believe what was unfolding before me. Present Ritual Curtain Phoenix: Leads to: \"Your Magistry!\" Ihmus: That's when I saw the accused... stab the high priest with a dagger! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you really see what you say you did? Ihmus: Are ya saying I'm lying about this?! Well, I'm not! It's etched permanently in this old noggin! Maya: B-But, I didn't do what you say I did... I didn't even get a chance to touch the dagger on the day of the rite! Ihmus: Whadda I know o' that? All I know is what I saw! I've never even seen ya before in my life. What possible reason could I have to lie?! Phoenix: Urrrrrrgh...! Phoenix: (I didn't expect there to be any witnesses way up there.) Maya: B-But, I... I don't remember doing that at all! Phoenix: I know. I have a feeling the witness is lying. There has to be an inconsistency somewhere in his testimony. (I should take another look at the Court Record.) Phoenix: Your Magistry! I had my doubts about this bushy-bearded witness, but now I KNOW we can't trust him. Ihmus: What?! You ain't just judging me solely on my bodacious beard, are ya? Phoenix: Not at all, Mr. Ihmus. It's much more than your sketchy appearance. It's your sketchy testimony. Judge: H-His testimony, you say?! Phoenix: Yes. Recall how the Inner Sanctum was that day. Specifically, that it was completely enclosed by the ritual curtain. Judge: Why yes! I believe you're right! Phoenix: The curtain would have completely blocked the witness's view from Mt. Poniponi. Therefore, he couldn't possibly have seen the murder happen! Ihmus: Hoo-hah...! Judge: Mr. Ihmus, have you been knowingly making false statements to this court?! Ihmus: Err... Umm... Well, uhhh... AAIEEEEEE! YA GOT MEEEEEEEEEE!!! Judge: The witness will lower his voice! Ihmus: I didn't actually see the accused herself! Phoenix: (He \"didn't actually see the accused herself\"? What's that supposed to mean?) Ihmus: Lemme set the record straight! I beg ya! Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder (Amended) -- Ihmus: I saw their shadowy silhouettes, projected against the ritual curtain! The figures were created by the light of the full moon on that clear and still night. She was just a shadow, but I could tell it was the accused, reverse-gripping that dagger! Phoenix: Sh-Shadows...? That's what you saw? Ihmus: That's right. I could see what was going on by the shadows projected onto the ritual curtain. Judge: In the future, Mr. Ihmus, I would rather you offer up accurate testimony from the start. Ihmus: Forgive me, my main man Mr. Magistry. Chalk it up to my fuzzy memory! Nahyuta: Though he saw but shadows, it is still valuable testimony. Phoenix: (You have to be kidding me...) Maya: Wh-What are we going to do now, Nick?! Phoenix: Umm... All I can think of is... ...to look for inconsistencies between the actual rite and what Mr. Ihmus says he saw. Judge: Now then, the defense may cross-examine the witness once more. Cross-Examination -- The Night of the Murder (Amended) -- Ihmus: I saw their shadowy silhouettes, projected against the ritual curtain! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So what you saw were simply shadows...? Ihmus: ...That's right. Those shadow figures on that bright white curtain... They showed through plain as day. I could see everything that happened! Phoenix: But Ms. Fey and Abbot Inmee were at the top of a mountain, late at night. The only light up there was coming from four small lanterns. How could the shadows have been projected that clearly onto the curtain? Ihmus: No wonder people harp on you lawyers! You're always so dang skeptical! The lanterns weren't the only sources of light, ya know! Ihmus: The figures were created by the light of the full moon on that clear and still night. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You claim to have seen shadowy figures that were projected onto the ritual curtain. But did you really see them, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: 'Course I did! The bright moonlight projected them onto that curtain, clear as day. It was like watching a scene out o' a horror movie from my front row seat on Mt. Poniponi! Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess the moon does shine a bit brighter when you're way up there...) Maya, do you recall how bright the moon was that night? Maya: Umm... I remember there weren't any clouds, and that the moon was definitely out. But I don't remember if it could cast any shadows. Phoenix: Okay, thanks. (We can't deny that the moon was really bright. Which means it's possible that it was bright enough to cause shadows to appear.) Ihmus: Har har har har har! I remember it just like it happened! Present Rites Guide Phoenix: Leads to: \"You saw silhouettes projected by the moonlight?\" Ihmus: She was just a shadow, but I could tell it was the accused, reverse-gripping that dagger! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How do you know it was Ms. Fey, if all you saw were shadows? Ihmus: It was that little bun on toppa her head! Didn't need to see her face. That distinctive bob's a dead giveaway! Never underestimate my keen sense o' observation! Har har har har har! Now that's one funny haircut! Maya: It's not nice to make fun of a girl's hairstyle! I like my hair this way! Besides! You're one to talk, you sasquatch! Ihmus: You're not into this wild, manly look I'm sporting? Shows what you know, little girl! Haaar har har har har! Maya: Nick...!  Isn't there some kind of a crime you can charge him with?! Phoenix: I-I'm afraid it doesn't work that way... Phoenix: Now he claims he only saw shadows? His testimony has sketchy written all over it. Maya: Then there must be an inconsistency in there somewhere! Phoenix: ...Yep. (Was he really watching everything from Mt. Poniponi? If so, then I should see how his testimony lines up with the conditions of the rite.) Phoenix: You saw silhouettes projected by the moonlight? Sorry, but that's just not possible. Ihmus: Wh-Whaddaya mean?! How's it not possible that it was totally possible?! That's impossible! Phoenix: (I think I'm going to need a \"logicalese\" translation on that...) Let's take a look at this rites guide, shall we, Mr. Ihmus? The rite is held \"when the moon is directly over the summit of Mt. Poniponi.\" Ihmus: Doot doot doooooot... Phoenix: So if the moon was shining from the west, shadows would've been cast eastward. But Mr. Ihmus was standing to the west of the Inner Sanctum on Mt. Poniponi. Judge: O Holy Mother! Phoenix: That's right. Our witness here couldn't have seen any shadowy figures on that curtain! Ihmus: N-N-No... NO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY-HEE-HEE-HEEEE! Judge: Hmm... Perhaps it was the sacred flames of the lanterns that cast the shadows he saw? Phoenix: I'm afraid not. I inspected them during my investigation, but... ...the flames were too small to cast the crisp, distinct figures Mr. Ihmus claims to have seen. Ihmus: But...! I did see those silhouettes! Really! Maya: But how could he, Nick? Phoenix: Maybe he was someplace where they WERE visible...? (Wait... Don't tell me...!) Your Magistry! If Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows, it brings a brand-new fact to light! Judge: And that would be...? Phoenix: The brand-new fact that comes to light if Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows is... He didn't see the murder Phoenix: He didn't see the murder! Ihmus: But I just told ya I DID see the silhouettes on the curtain! If you think I didn't see the murder, then prove it! Phoenix: I can't actually prove it, but my lawyer's intuition tells me you didn't see it! Judge: Mr. Wright, you shall have to do better than that. Unless you want more of these, anyway. Phoenix: (He's saying he saw the shadows from Mt. Poniponi, which I've shown is impossible. In that case...) Your Magistry. If Mr. Ihmus really did see the shadows, there can be only one explanation. Leads to: \"He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!\" He was somewhere else Leads to: \"He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!\" Phoenix: He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder! Ihmus: D-Doot doot dooooot... Judge: Oh? Then where do you propose the witness was? Phoenix: Someplace where he could have seen the shadow figures, naturally! Maya: Wait! You mean... Phoenix: None of the mountains east of the Inner Sanctum are close enough for a good view. That leaves only one place he could've clearly seen the shadows from. Judge: ...And where might that be? Phoenix: This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder. The Plaza of Devotion Phoenix: He was at the Plaza of Devotion! Nahyuta: Do you truly believe Mr. Ihmus could see the Inner Sanctum from there? Phoenix: He must have really good eyes. Ihmus: Ooh, I do pride myself on my excellent vision! But still, you think I could've seen the Inner Sanctum with a big ol' mountain in the way? Judge: It's not a matter of good eyesight, defense. I must punish you for not seeing that. Phoenix: Argh... Should've seen that coming... (All righty, then...) Judge: You lawyers are a desperate lot, aren't you. Phoenix: Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'll get it right this time! Leads back to: \"This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.\" The high priest's home Phoenix: He was at the high priest's home! Judge: And just how do you propose he saw those curtain shadows from there? Phoenix: Umm, the witness must be clairvoyant. Judge: Clairvoyant?! Is this true, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: Do I look like a psychic nutjob to you? Judge: ...Not a psychic one, at any rate. Phoenix: (Well, at least the insult wasn't directed at me this time.) Judge: You lawyers are a desperate lot, aren't you. Phoenix: Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'll get it right this time! Leads back to: \"This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.\" The Inner Sanctum Leads to: \"Mr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side!\" Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side! That's the only place from which he could've seen the shadowy figures! Ihmus: Hoo-haaaaaah! Nahyuta: .........Ngh! Maya: Really?! Wow, I didn't even think of that! Judge: But wasn't the Inner Sanctum off-limits to all but the victim and the accused? Phoenix: And the third party who was there, you mean. I get the feeling that's a subject Prosecutor Sahdmadhi would rather not touch right now. Nahyuta: ..................... Judge: Ah, you mean...! Phoenix: That's right. This witness was at the scene of the crime. Which means he is the mysterious third party we saw during the Divination S\u00e9ance. He could be the one who dressed as Lady Kee'ra and killed the high priest! Ihmus: Goo-geeeeeeh! Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaat?! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: No one but the two participants were allowed anywhere near the Inner Sanctum. And the only way up there are the stairs that start down at the Plaza of Devotion. So tell me: How do you propose the witness entered that sacred space? Phoenix: Oh, umm... He must've, uhhh... (I haven't thought THAT far ahead...) Judge: The sanctum has sheer cliffs on three sides and a steep, towering rock face on the other. No one could have made it there by climbing the faces of those cliffs. Nahyuta: His Magistry speaks true. To say Mr. Ihmus was at such an inaccessible location is but a bid to tarnish his credibility. Is that not right? Ihmus: Right! I wasn't at the Inner Sanctum! No sir, no how! At least I'm pretty sure I wasn't! Phoenix: Phoenix: T-Then, what about those silhouettes you claim to have seen? Ihmus: I'm starting to think I've been imagining things! Phoenix: What?! Th... This is insane! Gallery: I knew we couldn't trust that lawyer. He's trying to frame the witness! Judge: Peace! Peace, I say! Phoenix: (This is impossible! Unless I can show how he got to the Inner Sanctum... ...it just looks like I'm trying to slander Mr. Ihmus.) Maya: I believe in you, Nick! Rah, rah, siss boom bah! Fight, fight, Phoenix Wright! Gallery: Just look at the accused. Has she no shame? Maya: What's your problem, lady?! Phoenix Wright is very trustworthy, I'll have you know! Gallery: She's got some nerve for a criminal! I bet that lawyer poisoned her mind. Phoenix: P-Please, Maya, you're only making it worse. I appreciate the vote of confidence, but it's probably best to keep it to yourself for now... Judge: I would advise the defense to think carefully before making any more sudden outbursts. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Magistry... (If I wasn't the bad guy before, I definitely am now!) Nahyuta: Now, Mr. Ihmus. I would like you to think back carefully... ...before you testify next about where you were that night. Witness Testimony -- I Wasn't at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: I was never at the Inner Sanctum, I tell ya! That much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory. Besides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place! Boy, you lawyers sure are scary! Phoenix: (I guess it might've been impossible for him to get to the Inner Sanctum like he claims, but...) Nahyuta: Now will you desist in trying to frame this innocent witness? Gallery: Yeah! I'd like to see you explain how he got up there! Judge: Mr. Wright. Is it not time to end these cross-examinations? Nahyuta: \"A moment of desperation leads to one hundred million years of torment.\" (Changed from ['A moment of desperation leads to 100 million years of torment.'] in the original release) It means that for each moment a sinner spends struggling to deny their sins... ...one hundred million years of torment are added to their time in hell. (Changed from [...100 million years of torment are added to their time in hell.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Khura'inism is the strictest religion ever!) Nahyuta: And just so you know, you've already accrued two hundred million extra years. (Changed from [And just so you know, you've already accrued 200 million extra years.] in the original release) Gallery: Plus the five they started with... that's seven hundred million years of torment! (Changed from [Plus the 500 million years they started with... that's 700 million years of torment!] in the original release) Maya: Sure, what's another two hundred million, give or take. (Changed from [Sure, what's another 200 million, give or take.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Well, it's a big deal to me! I can't keep saying that the witness was there at the Inner Sanctum... ...if I can't prove it. The problem is, how am I going to do that?) Cross-Examination -- I Wasn't at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: I was never at the Inner Sanctum, I tell ya! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure you weren't there? Ihmus: All I'm sure of is that you're deeply skeptical! Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, are all lawyers always like this? Nahyuta: Most certainly. They always try to pin crimes on innocent witnesses, without any proof whatsoever. They are no better than bacteria or viruses. Ihmus: Yikes! You mean he's contagious?! He's gonna give me... lawyer-itis! Phoenix: (Okay, this is getting ridiculous.) Ihmus: Whew, that was a close one. He almost put me there at the scene of the crime when I wasn't even there! Ihmus: That much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You just said your memory was fuzzy! Ihmus: I sure did. What's the big deal? Phoenix: I'll tell you what! Your testimony isn't very credible if your memory of the events is fuzzy! Ihmus: Oh, no worries there. My memory may be fuzzy, but I'm very clear on one thing! Phoenix: (Here we go again...) Ihmus: If you asked me whether or not I remember what I did that night, I'd say I do! Judge: In short, you are confident that your testimony is true. ...Is that correct, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: Har har har har har! Exactly! Guess ya don't get to be a judge for nothing! So, in closing, I can clearly say that I was totally not there! Ihmus: Besides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Hmm... I wonder if it really was impossible for you to get to the Inner Sanctum...? Nahyuta: If you have something to say, just say it. Phoenix: Couldn't there have been another way to get there? A way that wouldn't attract attention? Ihmus: No, there isn't! Phoenix: (Which means, there is.) Judge: Perhaps the defense would share its theory with us. Phoenix: (I don't even have a wild guess, let alone a theory, though. Time to reach into my bag of bluffs!) To reach the Inner Sanctum without attracting any attention... He climbed up the cliff Phoenix: No one would've noticed if he had scaled up the side of the mountain. He could've snuck into the Inner Sanctum that way! Ihmus: Har har har har har! The cliff face is all loose and crumbly 'round there. Even a pro mountain climber couldn't have made it up that way! Nahyuta: Everyone here in Khura'in knows that. But let us forgive the defense's ignorance -- he is a foreigner, after all. Phoenix: W-Why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things?! Ihmus: Tough luck, lawyer! I couldn't have gotten up to the Inner Sanctum by scaling the cliff! Phoenix: Arrrgh! ...Please add that to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus. Adds statement \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" if not already added or changes statement from \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" or \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" to \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" He came from the plaza Phoenix: Maybe you snuck up to the Inner Sanctum via the stairs in the Plaza of Devotion? Ihmus: Har har har har har! With all those people at the plaza?! I don't think so! Phoenix: But they were all completely absorbed in prayer. With a little stealth, you could've slipped by without drawing any attention! Nahyuta: I am afraid that would have been impossible. During the rite... ...the gate to the stairs was locked tight from the Inner Sanctum side. Phoenix: Wh-What?! Ihmus: Yeah! If I'd tried to force the lock open... ...someone there woulda noticed, even if they were deep in prayer! Phoenix: Nngh! ...P-Please add that to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus. Adds statement \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" if not already added or changes statement from \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" or \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" to \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" He fell from the sky Phoenix: Maybe you fell from the sky? Ihmus: Har har har har har! The lawyer thinks he's a comedian now! Nahyuta: I was wondering what crazy theory you would propose next. Well, defense, let's hear it. Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus could've... um... parachuted down! We already know the weather was clear, and there was no wind to speak of. Perfect weather for skydiving, I'd say! Nahyuta: Now that you have been backed into a corner, your delusions grow ever more delusional. The Inner Sanctum is on a tiny ledge upon a sheer cliff over two thousand meters tall. (Changed from [The Inner Sanctum is on a tiny ledge upon a sheer cliff over 2,000 meters tall.] in the original release) One misstep, and a skydiver would soon find themself in the Twilight Realm. Ihmus: Yeah! I don't care how still the wind was. Even I couldn't have made that jump! Phoenix: Wait! What's this building on top of the sacred mountain...? Nahyuta: That is Royal Penitentiary No. 4. Phoenix: (Oh, right. Princess Rayfa mentioned there was a prison up there.) How do you get your prisoners up there anyway? Nahyuta: By helicopter. But only with authorization from the minister of justice. He is the only one who can approve flights that pass over the Inner Sanctum. Mountain Range Poster updated in the Court Record. Nahyuta: Might I also add, defense... ...that no parachute or any other equipment necessary for skydiving have been found. Ihmus: Are ya saying I flew down there by flapping my arms? I may be an incredible dude, but even I'm not capable of that! Phoenix: Arngh... Well, please add that statement to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus. Adds statement \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" if not already added or changes statement from \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" or \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" to \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" He fell from the sky (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maybe you fell from the sky? Ihmus: Har har har har har! The lawyer thinks he's a comedian now! Nahyuta: I was wondering what crazy theory you would propose next. Well, defense, let's hear it. Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus could've... um... parachuted down! We already know the weather was clear, and there was no wind to speak of. Perfect weather for skydiving, I'd say!

The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" or \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" to \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" Ihmus: No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You really couldn't climb your way up? Like, what if there was a route where the rock is more solid? Or maybe you're a celebrated rock climber. You know, something like that? Ihmus: As I said before, the rock's all loose and crumbly! And there's no route up there where the rock's more solid. Moreover, I've never rock climbed a day in my life! Judge: Any attempt to climb that mountain would be as good as throwing your life away. Phoenix: Aw, come on, Your Magistry... Judge: You continue to claim that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum. Yet said claim shall remain but a claim without any supporting evidence, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I realize that, Your Magistry. (If I can't find any inconsistencies, guess I can always try to elicit some more testimony.) Ihmus: The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who can verify that the gate was actually locked? I mean, what if it wasn't? Nahyuta: The high priest himself was seen locking it before the rite began. And we have many believers from the plaza who can corroborate this. Ihmus: Guess you struck out again, Mr. Lawyer Man! Phoenix: (What if there was a spare key to the gate? But I'm in no position to prove that, so... what now?) Judge: You continue to claim that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum. Yet said claim shall remain but a claim without any supporting evidence, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I realize that, Your Magistry. (If I can't find any inconsistencies, guess I can always try to elicit some more testimony.) Ihmus: It's not like I can fly through the air, either! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You wouldn't need to flap your arms if you had some gear. Nahyuta: As I have already stated... ...nothing of the sort was found in or around the scene of the crime. Ihmus: Har har har har har! I'd sure like to see some o' that so-called gear you're talking about! Phoenix: (I know, I know... But was there really nothing like that at the Inner Sanctum? What if there was something that could've been used as a parachute? I should give the evidence another look.) Judge: You continue to claim that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum. Yet said claim shall remain but a claim without any supporting evidence, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I realize that, Your Magistry. (If I can't find any inconsistencies, guess I can always try to elicit some more testimony.) Present Sanctum Prayer Flags Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Mr. Ihmus is right.\" Ihmus: Boy, you lawyers sure are scary! Press Phoenix: Now hold on. Lawyers aren't scary! Ihmus: But you're saying I was at the Inner Sanctum when I wasn't! Anyone who'd try to frame an innocent man like that is scary in my book! Gallery: LAWYERS ARE SCARY! LAWYERS ARE SCARY!IT'S A SETUP! IT'S DEFINITELY A SETUP! Phoenix: I'm not trying to set anyone up! I-I'm going to provide evidence and explain exactly how it was done. Nahyuta: The gallery speaks true. They know the depth of a lawyer's sin, and the poverty of his virtue. Phoenix: (There may be some bad apples, but we're not all like that, you know!) Maya: Don't worry, Nick! I'll still root for you, no matter how morally bankrupt you become! Phoenix: (Thanks a bunch, Maya...) Ihmus: Har har har har har! Phoenix: (Mr. Ihmus wasn't at the Inner Sanctum? Or more precisely, couldn't get there?) Maya: Hmm... I don't see a way out of this. Phoenix: Yeah, these kinds of debates only get worse if you argue them the wrong way. I'll have to pry some conclusive testimony out of him, and then present some evidence! Maya: Like when you're trying to catch frogs from a pond! Once you've got a grip on one, you'd better hold on tight! Phoenix: R-Right... Something like that. Phoenix: ...Mr. Ihmus is right. He couldn't have skydived down there without any gear. Ihmus: Well now, finally come around, have ya? Now you see that I couldn't have possibly been there at the Inner Sanctum! Phoenix: Right. ...If you didn't have any gear, that is. Ihmus: Wh-Wh-Whaaat on eaaaarth are you talking about?! Phoenix: (That overreaction is a dead giveaway that I'm on the right track!) Take a look at this piece of evidence! Judge: Those are prayer flags, are they not? Phoenix: Yes, but they have been sewn together... ...to create one big banner. A banner that could also function like a parachute! Nahyuta: Pohlkunka...! Phoenix: The people of Khura'in are so used to seeing prayer flags... ...that the police didn't even think twice about these flags during their investigation. Nahyuta: N-No, this cannot be! Phoenix: The witness landed at the Inner Sanctum by using these prayer flags as a parachute! Is that not right, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: There's no way out. I'm surrounded! Phoenix: Um... Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: All this talk's jogged my memory. I-I-I guess... I guess I WAS there at the Inner Sanctum after all! Nahyuta: Grrrrrr...! Phoenix: As I suspected, there WERE three people there that night! Maya: You did it, Nick! You weren't wrong, after all! Phoenix: Um, thanks? Mr. Ihmus. You were the one disguised as Lady Kee'ra that night, weren't you? Ihmus: Whaaa...?! N-No way, no how! Uhh... It's like this... Umm... Oh, yeah! I was only there at the Inner Sanctum by accident! Phoenix: By accident? Ihmus: Exactly! And that thing's not a parachute. It's a homemade paraglider! Phoenix: A paraglider? Are you telling me you could fly using that patchwork mess of material? Ihmus: It may not look like much, but it's as sturdy as can be! I rode the wind like an eagle, going higher and higher from my earthly launching point! But then something happened that forced me to land at the Inner Sanctum! Phoenix: So you just happened to land there? You expect me to believe that?! Judge: Now, now. Please calm yourself, Mr. Wright. However, the fact that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum is crucial testimony indeed. And it certainly warrants further explication. Therefore, let's continue with more testimony. Witness Testimony -- Why I Was at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: That evening, I was enjoying a trek through the night sky with my homemade paraglider. But just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened! An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum! As I landed, I banged my head, causing me to lose my memory! So you see, I ended up at the Inner Sanctum purely by accident! Nahyuta: Mr. Ihmus, you failed to mention any of this during your pre-trial questioning. Ihmus: Can't be helped! I mean, I'm just remembering it now! Nahyuta: Continue such slipshod testimony and you will be cast into the Hell of Hangnails... ...where you shall have hangnails grown and ripped out for eight hundred million years. (Changed from [...where you shall have hangnails grown and ripped out for 800 million years.] in the original release) Ihmus: HOO-HAAAAAAH! ...I think I'll pass on that! Phoenix: (Looks like that caught Prosecutor Sahdmadhi off-guard. This is my chance to rip his case to shreds!) Cross-Examination -- Why I Was at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: That evening, I was enjoying a trek through the night sky with my homemade paraglider. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were enjoying a trek through the night sky with your homemade paraglider? You didn't go to pray? Ihmus: A devout Khura'inist like me can pray anywhere -- even while flying through the sky! But I wouldn't recommend you try it. You're bound to end up dead! Har har har har har! Maya: A paraglider? I didn't see anything like that! Ihmus: That's 'cause o' the ritual curtain! It blocked your view! You shoulda seen me, majestically soaring between the mountains! Maya: R-Really? ...What do you think, Nick? Phoenix: D-Don't ask me. Ihmus: Har har har! I was really enjoying that flight! At first, anyway... Ihmus: But just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Something terrible happened? Ihmus: Exactly! And when I say terrible, I mean TERRIBLE! Phoenix: What? Was there something unexpected near Mt. Poniponi? Ihmus: Err... What was it again? Phoenix: ...Wait, you don't remember? Ihmus: Uhh... Let's just say it was terrible! Ihmus: An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What exactly was this \"accident\" you had? Ihmus: Good question. Now what was it again...? ...Wind? Oh yeah, it was the wind! And not just any wind, but a sudden gale force wind. Made me lose control. Phoenix: The wind was strong enough to make you lose control? Ihmus: Ya got that right. Phoenix: Okay, then. Please add that to your testimony. Changes statement from \"An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum!\" to \"Gale force winds came out of nowhere, so I made an emergency landing at the sanctum!\" Ihmus: Gale force winds came out of nowhere, so I made an emergency landing at the sanctum! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Had the wind been blowing the whole time around the mountains? Ihmus: Yep! Just the right amount o' wind for paragliding! So that sudden gale force wind was a real shocker! Phoenix: I see. So a decent wind had been blowing until then. Ihmus: Right! A paraglider's not much use without a decent wind! Present May 9th Newspaper Phoenix: Leads to: \"We have a saying in my country, Mr. Ihmus:\" Ihmus: As I landed, I banged my head, causing me to lose my memory! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where at the Inner Sanctum did you land? Ihmus: That's easy! Where the paraglider ended up! Phoenix: (I guess that makes sense. So, outside the ritual curtain, on the side where the moonlight shadows were cast.) Ihmus: But right as I landed, I hit my head on a rock! I lost both my consciousness and my memory! Haaar har har har har! Phoenix: (Something's seriously wrong with this guy.) Ihmus: So you see, I ended up at the Inner Sanctum purely by accident! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're lucky to be alive after an accident like that. Ihmus: Yeah, I'm just a lucky kinda guy! It's times like these that separate the men from the boys! Phoenix: Wow, I'd say you were incredibly lucky... Almost miraculously so. Ihmus: If ya got something to say, just say it! Phoenix: ...All right, Mr. Ihmus. It wasn't an accident, was it? You landed at the Inner Sanctum on purpose. Ihmus: Wh-What the--?! No, it was an accident, I'm telling ya! You don't even have any proof! So stop making things up about me! Phoenix: (His testimony's like a moving target!) Maya: Okay, Nick! Time for some evidence. You know, really grab him by the scruff of his neck! Phoenix: O-One thing at a time, Maya. First, I have to find an inconsistency. (But where there is constantly changing testimony... ...there are bound to be discrepancies and other issues!) Phoenix: We have a saying in my country, Mr. Ihmus: \"From one lie sprouts another.\" (Changed from ['One lie begets another.'] in the original release) Ihmus: Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: It means someone caught lying will lie again in an attempt to conceal their first lie. In other words, this current testimony is just a blatant lie you're telling to cover your tracks! Ihmus: What did you just say?! Phoenix: You claimed gale force winds caused you to lose control... ...but this newspaper has the weather report for the day of the murder. It says, \"The area around the Inner Sanctum will enjoy calm, clear skies today.\" Ihmus: P-P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa! Judge: Why, I do believe it does say that! Maya: \"From one lie sprouts another\"... That makes sense, but... (Chagned from [One lie begets another... That makes sense, but...] in the original release) Is it really a saying back home? I've never heard of it. Phoenix: Yeah... I kind of made that one up. Maya: For real? Phoenix: Your Magistry! The witness's testimony contains another flaw -- one that's even more fatal to his cause. Judge: More fatal, you say? The defense will explain himself at once! Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus claims he was flying up around the Inner Sanctum with his paraglider. But it would've been impossible to get all the way up there without any wind! Judge: Why, yes! I believe you're right! But we know the witness was at the Inner Sanctum, so... Mr. Ihmus! How did you get there?! And from where? Ihmus: ........................... Phoenix: (Without any wind, he couldn't have flown up there from the bottom of the mountain. By process of elimination... ...the only starting point that makes ANY sense is...!) Your Magistry, I believe I have the answer to your question. To reach the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here! Present Royal Penitentiary No. 4 Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hoo-hah! ...Are you insane?!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: This was his starting point! Nahyuta: Do you truly believe he arrived at the Inner Sanctum from there? Phoenix: Yes! Positive! Judge: Hmm... I fail to see how he could have reached the Inner Sanctum from there. Phoenix: (...Of course. What was I thinking?) Nahyuta: You are a fool. Such an answer is no better than what a monkey might offer. Judge: Now now, let us not be cruel. Even a monkey could point out a more probable location. Phoenix: (Great. Now the judge thinks I'm lower than a monkey.) Nahyuta: So, the lawyer was monkeying around when he claimed Mr. Ihmus flew down from above. Phoenix: No, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. The witness DID fly down from above. With that in mind... To get to the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here! Leads back to examination Ihmus: Hoo-hah! ...Are you insane?! Judge: Th-That's where he came from?! Phoenix: If he couldn't have come from below, the only other option is from above. So you see, A'nohn Ihmus came down from Royal Penitentiary No. 4! From there, he could have easily reached the Inner Sanctum by parachute! And that means he might have also killed the high priest! Judge: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus! Were you the third party at the Inner Sanctum?! And the one behind the warning to halt the rite that the victim received?! Was it you we saw in his final memory?! Are you the rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra?! Ihmus: HOOOOOOOOO-HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, sir! Help me out here! Nahyuta: .................. Maya: You did it! You finally left him speechless! Ihmus: Aw, c'mon, Mr. Prosecutor Man! Nahyuta: ...Quiet, you fool. You should use this time to prepare yourself for what is to come. For a fate far worse than Hangnail Hell awaits you now. Ihmus: ......... Nahyuta: Well done, defense. I must concede this point to you. The witness did, in fact, descend to the Inner Sanctum from Royal Penitentiary No. 4. Phoenix: (Huh? He didn't even put up a fight this time. That's awfully... generous of him.) Nahyuta: But if you are as perceptive as you seem, then surely you've already figured out the riddle. ...The riddle of A'nohn Ihmus's true identity. Phoenix: Oh, umm... (His true identity? Not sure I know quite yet, but I guess I'll have to answer with something...) Judge: ...It would seem I am the only one still in the dark here. Would the defense care to enlighten me? Who is this man we've been calling A'nohn Ihmus? Phoenix: The witness's true identity is... Present Wanted Poster Leads to: \"Is this really him?!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Hm? I fail to see how that shines any light on the matter. Nahyuta: That's because it doesn't. This piece of evidence has nothing to do with the witness's identity. Phoenix: I was just testing Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, to see if he really knew! Judge: ...It seems you are the clueless one here, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Couldn't bluff my way out of that one... Hmm... If he was at Royal Penitentiary No. 4 before he landed at the Inner Sanctum... ...then he must be...!) Judge: Unless you wish to be removed from this Hall of Justice, I suggest you think carefully. What is A'nohn Ihmus's true identity? Leads back to: \"The witness's true identity is...\" Phoenix: (Is this really him?!) Nahyuta: Hmph. Only now do you realize the truth. Well? Please do share with us your belated insight. Phoenix: Umm... Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Why are you holding back?! (Changed from [What's wrong, Nick? Just say it!] in the original release) Phoenix: Because this isn't going to be very helpful to our case... Maya: Really?! Are you sure? Phoenix: (Unfortunately, I've got no other choice.) That scruffy beard and shaggy mane completely threw me off. But it's all becoming clear now. The nighttime B.A.S.E. jump from the mountaintop prison... The precision landing at the Inner Sanctum using only a homemade parachute... Ihmus: ..................... Phoenix: Only a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is Datz Are'bal -- prison escapee and key member of Dhurke's rebel group! Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAAT?! Ihmus: GAAAH-HAAAAAAH! Judge: The witness is an escaped prisoner?! Nahyuta: Precisely. The police have been scouring every corner of the city to no avail. Meanwhile, here he was under our noses the entire time. Ihmus: Hoo-haaaaaaaaaaaah! Didn't think anyone would see through my clever disguise! Nahyuta: Heh heh heh. But the witness's charade is not all that has been shattered. ...Is it, defense? Phoenix: (Boy, do I hate this guy...) Nahyuta: Please recall the defense's own words... Phoenix: Whoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, \"Do not perform the rite.\" But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered. Judge: Who do you suppose sent that letter? Phoenix: A person with something to hide -- the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra herself! Nahyuta: He claimed that the real killer was \"the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra.\" Maya: Yeah, and what's your point?! Nahyuta: What of the witness's true identity? Phoenix: Only a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is Datz Are'bal -- prison escapee and key member of Dhurke's rebel group! Maya: *gasp* Oh no! Nahyuta: He is a rebel and an escaped prisoner. He could not possibly have been Lady Kee'ra, mortal enemy of the rebels! Maya: Nooooooooooo! Nahyuta: ...Now, perhaps the witness will enlighten us to the truth. After all, he has yet to refute any of this. Ihmus: Hoo-haaah! Ya got me! I'm the razor-sharp fangs of the Defiant Dragons! Datz: ...Datz Are'bal! Nahyuta: When did you get your memory back? Datz: Oh, around the time you guys were talking about there being no wind. But ya gotta gimme credit for making up all that testimony off the top o' my head! Phoenix: Are you prepared to tell us the truth now? Datz: Well, it's true I parachuted down to the Inner Sanctum...  ...but I banged my head on impact, and ended up unconscious outside the ritual curtain! In short, all my eyewitness testimony was a big fat lie. Phoenix: A big fat LIIIIIIEE?! Datz: Oh, and by the way! Long time no see... Yuty! Nahyuta: ......... Phoenix: (Wait... They know each other?) Nahyuta: Your Magistry. This filthy rebel belongs in a jail cell. Judge: Oh, yes! Of course! Bailiff, seize him at once! Datz: Seems ya really have forgotten the will of the dragon, huh, Yuty. But I haven't. And no dogs of the Ga'ran regime are gonna lay a finger on me! ...Alley-oop! Nahyuta: Deploy all available resources! I want all units placed on high alert! Judge: The escaped prisoner... escaped again. Nahyuta: The police force has been placed on high alert. He will be caught before long. Maya: An escaped prisoner who's escaped the law again after giving a ton of false testimony... Talk about a troublemaker. Phoenix: He really pulled a number on all of us. (What was the point of all that, anyway?) Judge: Well, I can't help but feel that entire episode was an enormous waste of time. Nahyuta: ...Your Magistry. Perhaps it was not as great of a waste as you might believe. Judge: What makes you say that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: Datz Are'bal dropped something as he made his escape from these halls. Phoenix: (Hm? That scrap of paper looks awfully familiar.) Nahyuta: These appear to be direct orders from Dhurke. Judge: From Dhurke?! The rebel leader?! Oh, but we only have a small corner of it... Phoenix: (Wait, I remember now...!) Your Magistry, I've seen that scrap of paper before! Judge: You have? Phoenix: The scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this. Present Bloodstained Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"And this is...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Take a look at this. This could be related to the scrap of paper Mr. Are'bal dropped. Judge: Really? Because I fail to see the connection. Phoenix: I suspected as much. Okay, on to the next piece of evidence. Judge: One moment, Mr. Wright! We move on when I say it's time to move on! Phoenix: Arngh, can't you let it slide once in a while? (I better carefully compare the scrap of paper Mr. Are'bal dropped to the evidence I have.) Judge: I will ask the defense once more. Where have you seen this scrap of paper before? Leads back to: \"The scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this.\" Judge: And this is...? Phoenix: I found it at the scene of the crime. It appears to be a copy of the order that Mr. Are'bal dropped. If we put the two together, we should be able to read what the order says! Judge: Oh, my! And just what does it say, Mr. Wright?! Phoenix: ..................... I can't read Khura'inese. Judge: Ah... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, if you please. Nahyuta: The ignorant lawyer has not bothered to learn our language? Very well, then... .............................. ...I do not understand. Phoenix: Well? Wh-What does it say?! Nahyuta: Using the lamplights as a landmark, he was to parachute down to the Inner Sanctum. Upon the rite's completion, he was to don Lady Kee'ra's robes and make his escape. Judge: What?! That is how he was to escape from prison?! Phoenix: (So, if I were to assume that Mr. Are'bal was the one who killed the high priest... ...then maybe it was because Abbot Inmee tried to thwart his escape plan...?) Nahyuta: O foul lawyer... I'm afraid that is simply ludicrous. Phoenix: Huh? B-But I didn't say anything. (D-Did he just read my mind?) Nahyuta: I know how your putrid mind works. Unfortunately for you, however, now that the rebel's escape plan has been revealed... ...it is clear that Datz Are'bal is not the high priest's killer. Phoenix: H-How can you be so sure?! Nahyuta: If only you would use that putrid brain of yours every once in a while. Datz Are'bal's plan could not have worked without the help of a certain individual. Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean? Nahyuta: I am speaking of Abbot Inmee, of course. Had Datz Are'bal simply donned Lady Kee'ra's robes and made his escape alone... ...he would have been far too conspicuous. But were he by the high priest's side... ...the faithful citizens praying in the plaza would have had no cause to suspect anything. It is, therefore, unthinkable that Datz Are'bal was the high priest's killer! Phoenix: AUGH! Judge: S-So then, you're saying...! The high priest was a...?! Oh, I cannot bear to say it! Nahyuta: I am afraid it is so. He numbered among the rebels who threaten our kingdom. Judge: How could this be?! Gallery: ...The high priest... a rebel?Th-There must be some kind of mistake! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: ...Let it go, and move on. Accept the truth. It is the only way. And that goes double for you, defense. Cease your futile battle now. Phoenix: And why should I? Nahyuta: Because I will now put the final nail in the coffin of the accused. Now that we have eliminated Datz Are'bal from our list of suspects... ...there is only one person that still remains: the accused, Maya Fey. Phoenix: Phoenix: Hold it right there! Aren't you forgetting something important? Judge: Something... important? Please do explain, defense. Phoenix: We can't end this trial without looking into... The arrow Phoenix: What about the arrow that was fired into the high priest's house?! Nahyuta: It was simply a means to deliver the warning letter to the victim. Phoenix: (Hmm...That's more or less the same conclusion we came to yesterday...) You know... I guess you're right. Judge: Oh? Then THIS should be just about right as well! It seems there is no need to continue this trial any longer. Phoenix: No, Your Magistry. There is still something important that must be brought to light! Leads back to: \"We can't end this trial without looking into...\" The murder weapon Phoenix: What about the murder weapon?! We haven't found it yet! Nahyuta: What does it matter if it has been found or not? The fact remains that the victim was killed with it by the accused. Judge: I also fail to see how that would be important, Mr. Wright. This, however, is. It seems there is no need to continue this trial any longer. Phoenix: No, Your Magistry. There is still something important that must be brought to light! Leads back to: \"We can't end this trial without looking into...\" The third party Leads to: \"I'm talking about the true identity of the Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance vision! Phoenix: I'm talking about the true identity of the Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance vision! If that wasn't Datz Are'bal, then who was it?! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: That matter has already been resolved. Phoenix: It has? (What's he talking about?) Nahyuta: It is as I have maintained from the start. There was no third party in the S\u00e9ance vision. Phoenix: Phoenix: B-But there was another Lady Kee'ra there besides Maya Fey! We all saw her! Nahyuta: Phoenix: (Wh-What the--?! I... I can't do my finger point!) Nahyuta: Hrnh! Phoenix: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Nahyuta: ...It is time to let it go, and move on. Your fate has already been sealed, much like your arm. Phoenix: (Th-This hardly seems fair.) Nahyuta: It is quite simple once you consider where the victim and the accused were at the time. If the victim was near the spring with his back to the accused, what would he see ahead? Judge: Besides the water itself... there is nothing but the warbaa'd statue. Nahyuta: Precisely. The Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance is the warbaa'd statue draped in her sacred robes! Phoenix: N-NOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAY! Nahyuta: The accused wanted the false Lady Kee'ra to appear in the S\u00e9ance vision... ...before she came from behind and stabbed the victim with the dagger in a reverse grip. Judge: But why would the accused want to do something like create a false Lady Kee'ra? Nahyuta: To show it to the victim as he was being slain. Judge: And what reason would the accused have to fool the victim she was about to kill? Nahyuta: It was not the victim she was trying to fool. ...It was this very court itself. Judge: Come again? Nahyuta: Suspicion would not fall on the accused if it looked as if another Lady Kee'ra was there. And the defense was foolish enough to fall for it and claim it was a third party in disguise. Judge: Are... Are you saying...?! Nahyuta: I am. It was all a cleverly wicked scheme, perpetrated by the accused. A scheme in which she sought to use the S\u00e9ance vision to mislead us! Phoenix: (This can't be happening!) Nahyuta: What a face you are making, defense. I am surprised you are taking this so hard. After all, did I not clearly state a while back... ...that you were chasing after naught but a deluded fantasy? Nahyuta: Heh heh heh... Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a deluded fantasy. Phoenix: (You're telling me he knew this is how it would turn out all the way back then...? And that he was just waiting for the most effective moment to spring it on me?!) Nahyuta: Heh heh heh. Do you understand now? I have had you dancing in the palm of my hand this entire time. Phoenix: It... It can't be--! Judge: This is an outrage! You took our royal priestess's sacred Divination S\u00e9ance... ...and used it to commit this most foul and despicable murder?! Maya: N-No! I did nothing of the sort! Phoenix: (Maya...) Maya: Nick! It's not true! I... I didn't...! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Cease this ugly display. Your fate is sealed now that the facts have been exposed. Your Magistry. The time has come to convict this criminal who only seeks to taint this sacred hall. Judge: Indeed. It seems this trial is over. Phoenix: Judge: Does the defense wish to offer up yet another counterargument or something? Phoenix: Umm... The accused is... uhh... is not the killer! And uh... here's why... (Now what do I do!? I've got nothing!) Judge: It would appear that the defense has run out of arguments to make. Phoenix: (I thought for sure that that rebel was the killer! The only person with a possible motive -- the one dressed as Lady Kee'ra -- has vanished. And I've got nothing to use against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's argument! Damn it! I can't lose now! Not like this!) Judge: Very well then, I shall now render my verdict. Phoenix: W-Wait! Please, wait! I'm begging you! Nahyuta: It is time to let it go, and move on. Judge: This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... Guilty Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Bailiff: Your Magistry! Please forgive the interruption, but... Judge: What is the meaning of this?! Bailiff: A body has been found in the Plaza of Devotion, Your Magistry! Nahyuta: ...What's this? Phoenix: (A body? What happened now?) Bailiff: And we found this sticking out of the victim. Judge: Wh-Why that's... Lady Kee'ra's Warbaa'd Dagger! Gallery: Lady Kee'ra! She has returned from the Twilight Realm once more!She has come to defeat the rebels! Judge: Peace! Nahyuta: Well, it would seem the dagger that was once lost has now been found. Bailiff: I have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: Yes? Bailiff: This dagger... It bears the fingerprints of Maya Fey on it! Phoenix: WHA-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Maya: B-But... Phoenix: (Why would Maya's prints be on it?) Nahyuta: .............................. I cannot believe it, yet it must be true... Judge: Is something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: This trial has run its course, and the accused's guilt has been firmly established. However... ...it would seem the defense was right about one thing. Phoenix: I-I was? Nahyuta: You claimed that the murder at the Inner Sanctum... ...had been carried out by the rebel hunter masquerading as Lady Kee'ra. Phoenix: I did say something to that effect, but what of it? Judge: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! A-Are you suggesting what I think you are? Nahyuta: I believe the true identity of the rebel hunter who has been masquerading as Lady Kee'ra... ...is none other than the accused, Ms. Maya Fey! Phoenix: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat?! Maya: Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?! Judge: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Nahyuta: I realize how shocking this must seem. Looking back, however, I now realize there was much that pointed to this fact. The rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra was first sighted about two years ago. And the accused first came to our kingdom two years ago as well. Judge: Wh-Why, the timing matches perfectly! Nahyuta: But there is more... That warning letter was found in the high priest's bedroom three days before the rite. Despite his house being locked up tight that night. Phoenix: Phoenix: How does that prove anything?! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: It is difficult to believe an intruder could have found a way to enter such a secure house. However, the accused was known to come and go freely there. ...Mainly to prepare for the Purification Rite. Phoenix: Ah! Maya: Abbot Inmee was an important figure with a ton of duties, including training acolytes. He was really kind, even to a foreigner like me. He even invited me over to his house whenever I was between training sessions. Nahyuta: The accused could have easily left the house unlocked for herself without anyone noticing. Phoenix: Nooooooooooooooo! Lady Kee'ra's Warning updated in the Court Record. Nahyuta: If we assume that the accused was Lady Kee'ra... ...that more than establishes her motive for killing the high priest. Judge: Yes, the victim was secretly an insurgent, bent on helping Datz Are'bal escape, after all. Nahyuta: Precisely. That made him a target of Lady Kee'ra's wrath. And after killing the high priest, she then unleashed her divine justice on another rebel. So, it seems the scope of this case has expanded. We now have... two murders perpetrated by Ms. Maya Fey, masquerading as Lady Kee'ra. Judge: .................. If Ms. Fey is indeed a serial killer, it would affect the severity of her punishment. In light of this, I believe this second murder must be investigated before we can proceed. Nahyuta: As you wish, Your Magistry. Maya Fey, I hereby charge you with this second murder. May your defiled soul feel the weight of your sins. Phoenix: (A new murder charge on top of a guilty verdict?) Judge: It seems the defense will live to see one more day. Phoenix: (Talk about \"hanging on by a thread\"...) Nahyuta: Heh heh heh. Come tomorrow, a far more terrible punishment awaits you. Judge: I hereby suspend these proceedings so that the second murder may be investigated. Until the conclusion of this new investigation, this court is adjourned! To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: That statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence. Nahyuta: Let it go, and move on. Abandon this folly. You know very well your evidence proves nothing. Phoenix: Nice try, but you can't make me give up. I'm going to prove I'm right! Judge: You can point your finger as much as you want, but you're simply wasting your time. It is a pitiful sight to see a lawyer who doesn't know when he is beat. Phoenix: (Argh... I just need to hang in there a little longer.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Anything come to mind? Nahyuta: ............ Judge: ............ Phoenix: W-Well...? Judge: Hm? Did the defense have something he would like to say? Phoenix: (That fell on deaf ears.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Judge: Is something the matter? Phoenix: Sorry. That scream just sort of slipped out. Judge: I don't know about trials in your country, but we refrain from such rash outbursts here. Perhaps this will deter any future urges you might have. Phoenix: (I'm not helping my case in the judge's eyes, both literally and figuratively.) Presenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination S\u00e9ance (on initial Insight) Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision? Rayfa: Inconsistent...? I think not! Phoenix: Exactly! That's where the inconsistency lies! Judge: No, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies. Phoenix: (Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...) Maya: Hmm... Phoenix: What is it, Maya? Maya: I'm... still trying to figure this whole Insight thing out. When the words change size... ...that means the intensity of those sensations is changing, too, right? Phoenix: That's what it looks like to me. Maya: So then... that's probably something we should keep an eye on, too. In short, we should be on the lookout for... ...changes that shouldn't take place, but they do anyway... ...and changes that don't occur when they should. Phoenix: How very perceptive of you. (I guess all that training's sharpened Maya's mind along with her powers.) Phoenix: Let's compare the vision to the Insights, while looking for changes in sensory intensity! Maya: Sounds like a plan! Presenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination S\u00e9ance (on all revised Insights) Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision? Rayfa: Inconsistent...? I think not! Phoenix: Exactly! That's where the inconsistency lies! Judge: No, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies. Phoenix: (Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...) Consult (during a cross-examination, when evidence must be presented) Maya: Looks like you can't count on your bluffing skills to save your butt this time. Phoenix: Yeah... This is a tough one. Maya: Well, to me, there's something about this one statement that seems off. Phoenix: Yeah, it does sound a little strange, doesn't it? Thanks, Maya. I'll take another look at the evidence. Maya: You can always count on me! Consult (during a cross-examination, when statements must be pressed) Maya: You're looking a little pale there, Nick. Are you all right? Phoenix: This trial is really putting me through the wringer. Maya: Maybe it's just a matter of getting the information you need. Phoenix: Right... Thanks, Maya. (Guess I'd better keep pressing, then!) Maya: Once you get more info, you can use it to make one of your famous bluffs! Phoenix: (She makes it sound like bluffing is my default move.) Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on initial Insight) Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Phoenix: Um, I'm having a tough time spotting a contradiction. Maya: Well, there was one sensation that caught my eye. You know that footsteps sensation? Didn't something about it seem strange to you? Phoenix: Now that you mention it... Thanks. I'll focus on that as I review the Insights. Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on first revised Insight) Maya: You're making that \"I-can't-find-a-contradiction\" face of yours again, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah, well... I'm kinda clutching at straws here. Maya: And I think we should focus on the sound of bells that were just uncovered. Phoenix: You're right. Let's focus on that sensation and take another look at Rayfa's Insights. Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on second revised Insight) Maya: You look like you're having a tough time, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah, because I can't find any contradictions. I mean, the sensations in the vision all seem perfectly fine to me... Maya: In that case, why don't you read the Insights while focusing on what the victim saw? Phoenix: (Of course! His sense of sight! Time to go over those Insights again!) Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on third revised Insight) Phoenix: Maya... I can't find any contradictions. Maya: Come on, Nick. A bit early to throw in the towel, don't you think? Phoenix: But I didn't notice anything wrong with the sensations that appeared as words just now. Maya: Well then, maybe the contradiction is in what Abbot Inmee saw. I think there's something fishy about the things that we can more clearly see now. Also... We should focus on not only the sensations, but the updated Insights, as well. Phoenix: Right. Thanks, Maya! Too many penalties Judge: This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... Guilty The Rite of Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 11, 1:03 PMTehm'pul Temple Phoenix: (What do I do now...? I can't believe Maya and I were actually found guilty...) Judge: This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey...  ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... Guilty Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Ahlbi: M-M-M-Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ahlbi! Ahlbi: I saw the whole trial! What's going to happen to Miss Maya now? Phoenix: ...I'm worried about that, too. But right now... Bailiff: I have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: Yes? Bailiff: This dagger... It bears the fingerprints of Maya Fey on it! Phoenix: Right now, I need to focus on the next trial. Ahlbi: The murder of Acolyte Zeh'lot, right? Phoenix: At least the jury is still out on that one, so to speak. (The two murders are most likely connected. If I can get to the bottom of Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder... ...it might give me the ammunition I need to overturn Maya's guilty verdict.) Ahlbi: Let me help you investigate! I want to assist you any way I can! Phoenix: I appreciate it, Ahlbi, but we're talking about a murder. Ahlbi: Yeah, but it's going to be hard for a foreigner to investigate this on his own! Phoenix: You have a point there. Phoenix: (Hmm... I wish I knew what to do.) Rayfa: ..................... Phoenix: (Hm? Isn't that...?) ...Your Benevolence. Rayfa: ............... Phoenix: Um, Princess Rayfa? Rayfa: Hm? ...Oh, it is you again. ...The dead lawyer walking, guilty of abetting a murderer under the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: Urk! (I see she hasn't lost any of her charm.) Rayfa: ........................... Phoenix: Why the long face? I thought you'd be glad I was found guilty under the DC Act. Rayfa: ...Hmph. I am in no mood to take joy in your suffering. For I was unable to defeat you, and had to leave the job to others. I failed in my sacred duty as the royal priestess. Phoenix: I guess that answers my question.) Rayfa: Have I misunderstood... the voice of the mitamah... yet again? ...Th-This--! This cannot be! Rayfa: .................. Phoenix: (All I did was defend my client... Nngh... I can't bear to see her looking so sad like this, though...) ...Your Benevolence. Rayfa: .................. Phoenix: Your Benevolence! Rayfa: Hm? Oh, Barbed Head. I thought you had already begun your journey to the Twilight Realm. Phoenix: I'm not dead yet! I still have an investigation to do... for tomorrow's trial. Rayfa: What's this?! D-Do you mean to say... ...you have not given up yet? Phoenix: That's right. I'm going to prove Maya innocent tomorrow. Rayfa: ............ But why? Why do you refuse to give up? I cannot fathom such obstinacy. Investigate all you want -- I care not! Phoenix: ...You really don't mind? But aren't you worried that a lawyer backed into a corner by the DC Act... ...might do something desperate, like forge evidence? Rayfa: What's this?! Phoenix: If left unsupervised, I'd be free to do whatever I wanted, you know. Rayfa: ............Grrr! Phoenix: (Okay, now to see if she takes the bait.) Rayfa: Yes... I see your point. Barbed Head... Phoenix: Yes? Rayfa: I know what happened yesterday. You perpetrated some sort of fraud or other misdeed while I was not watching! Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: That explains why I misunderstood the voice of the high priest's soul! Yes, of course! That is the only explanation! Phoenix: ............ (I was just trying to cheer her up. Now she thinks even less of me.) Rayfa: I must not allow you to sully our sacred Hall of Justice with your misdeeds ever again. Therefore, today, I will be monitoring your every move once more! I will not fail to spot your misdeeds this time! The moment I see anything out of the ordinary, I will send you straight to prison. And you, boy. Do not throw your lot in with this foreign devil. Ahlbi: ...B-But... Your Benevolence! Phoenix: It's okay, Ahlbi. You don't need to worry about me. I'll be back before you know it. (But first, I should probably lighten my load a bit.) Ahlbi, would you mind holding on to some evidence for me? Ahlbi: Of course not! I'm always glad to help! Unnecessary evidence unloaded onto Ahlbi. Ahlbi: May the Holy Mother's blessings be upon you! Phoenix: (Now then... The scene of the crime is the logical place to start. If I recall correctly, the body was found at the Plaza of Devotion.) Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: That boy has grown far too close to you. He will require re-education if he persists in befriending lawyers. Phoenix: Re-education? What exactly does that entail? Rayfa: First, he must meditate upon Lady Kee'ra for forty-eight hours in the prayer pose. Phoenix: How is that re-education? It sounds more like torture to me. What to do Rayfa: Barbed Head! You have an investigation to conduct, do you not?! Get on with it! Phoenix: Y-Yes, but... (Why does she always have to be like this?) Rayfa: What? Would you have preferred that tour guide boy tag along instead? Phoenix: Huh?! Oh, umm... Rayfa: Hmph, it would appear I have read your mind most accurately. Phoenix: (That smile of hers is downright scary.) Bazaar Examine Warbaa'd RAWWWRRR! Phoenix: Aaaaaaah! What the heck was that?! Rayfa: Honestly, what sort of grown man jumps at the call of a warbaa'd? Phoenix: What? That roar came from this bird? ...I-It is a bird, right? Rayfa: W-Well... give me a moment! ...Nayna! The warbaa'd has many natural enemies. Therefore, it mimics a lion's roar in order to scare them away. But you did not know that, did you? And you call yourself a lawyer! Hmph! Phoenix: You didn't know, either, until you asked Nayna. Rayfa: Enough! You... You... lamebrain! Yak Rayfa: Have you never seen a yak before, Barbed Head? Phoenix: Only in zoos. Rayfa: Well in Khura'in, they play an important part in our daily lives. Therefore, they must be treated with kindness and with respect. MOOOOOOOOO! Rayfa: H-Hey! What are doing?! I command you to cease that at once! Phoenix: (Wow... That yak is really licking and nuzzling the daylights out of Rayfa...) Rayfa: Foul beast! You have made a mess of my royal raiment! For that, I shall make a leather coat out of you later! Phoenix: What was that about treating them with \"kindness and respect\" again...? Produce cart Rayfa: Why, this giah'pam looks positively delicious. I think I shall take this one. Phoenix: Y-Your Benevolence! You can't just take things without paying! Rayfa: Shopkeeper! You will receive your payment from this barb-headed foreigner. Lady: Thank you, barb-headed foreigner. Phoenix: Peasants paying for princesses? This place is absolutely feudal. Poster Phoenix: (It's a poster... That's the Plumed Punisher, Khura'in's famous action hero. I guess we're not the only country with superheroes like that.) Steaming buns Rayfa: ........................ *groooowl*... Phoenix: ...Was that your stomach? Rayfa: N-No! Th-That was not me! *groooowl*... Rayfa: Th-That... was the cry of the warbaa'd! Phoenix: Would you like a magatah'man? Rayfa: Enough! I am not hungry! Phoenix: (Why can't some people just admit when they're hungry?) May 11Plaza of Devotion Phoenix: Looks like the police already finished their investigation. (To think someone would be killed here --  a place devoted to prayer. A body outline and... flowers? Did someone leave them here in memory of the deceased? Hm? And there's something different about the prayer flags today...) Rayfa: As the high priest's disciple, Acolyte Zeh'lot was utterly devoted to his training. First the high priest, and now his devoted disciple... Maya Fey will pay for this! Phoenix: As I keep trying to tell you, Maya has nothing to do with any of this! Rayfa: And you can prove this... how?! Phoenix: What do you think I'm doing here?! Gathering dirt and dust for the trial?! Rayfa: You and your smart mouth! This is precisely why you and your lawyerly ilk are so reviled. ???: Hey, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ema! Rayfa: It's that detective from your country again... Ema: Eep, it's the princess! Rayfa: You seem displeased that I am here. Ema: Oh, n-no, no! Don't be silly! Mr. Wright? I'm, uhh... I'm so sorry about what happened to Maya. Phoenix: It's not your fault, Ema. You were just doing your job. And if I had just done mine... Ema: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: ...But it's no use crying over spilled milk! Would you mind telling me what you know about the murder? It's do or die in court tomorrow. And I mean that literally. Ema: Gladly. I'll help in any way I can! Rayfa: Remember, I have my eyes on the both of you, so see to it that you commit no misdeeds. Ema: Of course not! Hmph, you're talking to a professional here. Examine Body outline Phoenix: Acolyte Zeh'lot died bent over in prayer. There's no trace of blood on the ground, though... The fact that there's so little bleeding could mean it was a single stab to a vital point. ...Not that that would've been very difficult, considering the position he was in. Prayer rug Phoenix: Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed in a prayer pose. With his head bent over like that, the last thing he saw must've been this rug. Rayfa: It is a prayer rug woven by devout monks. May the Holy Mother's blessing be upon his departed soul. Phoenix: It's strange that there are no bloodstains, though... Rayfa: Hmm... Perhaps it was so cold, his blood froze. Or perhaps it was absorbed by his vestment. Phoenix: (It IS pretty cold. Maybe the blood really did just freeze inside his body.) Flowers Phoenix: So these flowers were left here in memory of Acolyte Zeh'lot? What are they called? Rayfa: They are known as nahmanda, and they are given to express sorrow when a life is lost. Phoenix: It seems offering flowers in memory of the dead is a universal practice. Nahmanda Flower added to the Court Record. Flowers (subsequent times) Phoenix: So these flowers were left here in memory of Acolyte Zeh'lot? What are they called? Rayfa: They are known as nahmanda, and they are given to express sorrow when a life is lost. Phoenix: It seems offering flowers in memory of the dead is a universal practice. Purple prayer flag Phoenix: This prayer flag looks much newer than the rest. Umm, Your Benevolence? What does it say here? Rayfa: The dearest wishes of our subjects are written upon these prayer flags. Reading the prayers of others is considered rude, but if you must know... ...it says, \"At the usual spot. Bring grub. The key, too.\" Hmm, that is one of the more direct and practical prayers I have ever seen. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it's even a prayer. Brand New Flag added to the Court Record.

The key, too.\" Hmm, that is one of the more direct and practical prayers I have ever seen. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it's even a prayer. Talk The incident Phoenix: Let's see... How about starting with an overview of what happened. Ema: Sure. The victim is Puhray Zeh'lot. He was the high priest's disciple. His body was discovered around noon today... ...right after the rite wrapped up. Phoenix: So, during the high priest's murder trial. Ema: That's right. Apparently, he had been here praying since the day before the rite even started. Talk about serious devotion. Phoenix: (Yeah... I barely lasted a few minutes.) Ema: This is a picture of Mr. Zeh'lot's body. Phoenix: (That dagger in his upper back looks like it would've been particularly painful. Hm? Is that a tattoo on the back of his neck? It's... peach shaped...?) Ema: Everyone started leaving when the praying was finally done... ...but the victim remained bent over in prayer. And when they went over to check on him... Phoenix: They discovered he was dead, right? Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) added to the Court Record. Ema: Yes. The estimated time of death is May 9, sometime between... ...the start of the rite and the discovery of the high priest's body. In other words, we believe the crime took place during the Purification Rite. And the murder weapon was the same ceremonial dagger that killed the high priest. The prosecution believes Maya came down the stairs after killing the high priest... ...and then stabbed Mr. Zeh'lot with the same dagger. Phoenix: (Circumstantial evidence does point to Maya, but...) What about the cause of death? Ema: He apparently died instantly from the dagger that was left thrust into his upper back. Here's the autopsy report. Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Rayfa: Estimated time of death, you say? How can you know such a thing? I want to know! ...Well, Barbed Head! Out with it! Ema: Oh, so the princess of the spirit medium kingdom is interested in forensic science? Rayfa: Hmph! I have no interest is science, forensic or otherwise! Nevertheless, I will someday be queen. As such, it would be wise to know what silly things the common folk believe in. Ema: Tsk! There's nothing silly about it! I'll have you know, even Prosecutor Sahdmadhi holds forensics in high regard. Rayfa: Does he?! Hmm... Perhaps I should not underestimate the power of science. Still, I suppose it is nothing much compared to the Divination S\u00e9ance. Ema: She really doesn't have an adorable bone in her body. Phoenix: Ema, I think she's actually interested. Would you mind explaining it to her? Ema: ...I guess I have to now. ...Okay, there are many ways to estimate the time of death... ...but the most well-known method uses the change in body temperature. Rayfa: Interesting... Ema: Body temperature drops at a steady rate from the moment a person dies. That means we can tell how long someone's been dead by measuring their temperature. Rayfa: Hmm... I see, I see! That was quite enlightening. Barbed Head! Present your forehead now! Phoenix: What? Why? Rayfa: Hmm... You feel just a little over ninety-five degrees. It seems you are not dead yet. Phoenix: Of course I'm not! Rayfa: Heh heh. It was but a jest. After all, you're still the dead lawyer walking. Phoenix: (I fail to see the humor in any of this.) Were there any witnesses? With so many people here at the plaza, you'd think somebody would've seen something. Ema: You'd think so, wouldn't you? But we haven't found a single witness. Phoenix: How's that even possible?! Rayfa: Because everyone was bent over, utterly devoted to prayer, naturally. Phoenix: Oh, right, the back-shattering pose that nearly killed me. Still, you'd think someone would've noticed something. Ema: I thought so too, but... ...with the monk's scarf he had on, no one could see the dagger in his upper back. Plus, everyone was so absorbed in prayer, they didn't see or hear anything. Phoenix: I can't believe this. Rayfa: What you choose to believe is your choice, but the fact remains there were no witnesses. However, there is one piece of irrefutable evidence. ...The dagger. Ema: Sadly, yes... Phoenix: Argh... The incident (subsequent times) Phoenix: Let's see... How about starting with an overview of what happened. Ema: Sure. The victim is Puhray Zeh'lot. He was the high priest's disciple. His body was discovered around noon today... ...right after the rite wrapped up. Phoenix: So, during the high priest's murder trial. Ema: That's right. Apparently, he had been here praying since the day before the rite even started. Talk about serious devotion. Phoenix: (Yeah... I barely lasted a few minutes.) Ema: This is a picture of Mr. Zeh'lot's body. Phoenix: (That dagger in his upper back looks like it would've been particularly painful. Hm? Is that a tattoo on the back of his neck? It's... peach shaped...?) Ema: Everyone started leaving when the praying was finally done... ...but the victim remained bent over in prayer. And when they went over to check on him... Phoenix: They discovered he was dead, right? Ema: Yes. The estimated time of death is May 9, sometime between... ...the start of the rite and the discovery of the high priest's body. In other words, we believe the crime took place during the Purification Rite. And the murder weapon was the same ceremonial dagger that killed the high priest. The prosecution believes Maya came down the stairs after killing the high priest... ...and then stabbed Mr. Zeh'lot with the same dagger. Phoenix: (Circumstantial evidence does point to Maya, but...) What about the cause of death? Ema: He apparently died instantly from the dagger that was left thrust into his upper back. Here's the autopsy report. Phoenix: Were there any witnesses? With so many people here at the plaza, you'd think somebody would've seen something. Ema: You'd think so, wouldn't you? But we haven't found a single witness. Phoenix: How's that even possible?! Rayfa: Because everyone was bent over, utterly devoted to prayer, naturally. Phoenix: Oh, right, the back-shattering pose that nearly killed me. Still, you'd think someone would've noticed something. Ema: I thought so too, but... ...with the monk's scarf he had on, no one could see the dagger in his upper back. Plus, everyone was so absorbed in prayer, they didn't see or hear anything. Phoenix: I can't believe this. Rayfa: What you choose to believe is your choice, but the fact remains there were no witnesses. However, there is one piece of irrefutable evidence. ...The dagger. Ema: Sadly, yes... Phoenix: Argh... Murder weapon (appears after \"The incident\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about the murder weapon? Ema: The killer used the Warbaa'd Dagger, the legendary weapon of Lady Kee'ra. It was discovered impaled in the victim's upper back. Rayfa: The accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger, were they not? Ema: Y-Yes, they were. Warbaa'd Dagger added to the Court Record. Rayfa: With such irrefutable evidence, there is no questioning the accused's guilt. Phoenix: Not so fast. What about a motive? Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot. Rayfa: What do the police think about this matter? Murder weapon (subsequent times) Phoenix: Could you tell me about the murder weapon? Ema: The killer used the Warbaa'd Dagger, the legendary weapon of Lady Kee'ra. It was discovered impaled in the victim's upper back. Rayfa: The accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger, were they not? Ema: Y-Yes, they were. Rayfa: With such irrefutable evidence, there is no questioning the accused's guilt. Phoenix: Not so fast. What about a motive? Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot. Rayfa: What do the police think about this matter? Motive (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot! Rayfa: So you say, but let us now hear what the police think about the matter. Ema: The police believe Maya is the Lady Kee'ra figure who has been battling the rebels. And since Mr. Zeh'lot was the disciple of the high priest, who turned out to be a rebel... Rayfa: He, too, was likely a rebel, and therefore met the same untimely demise as his teacher. Ema: ...Yes, that is how the police currently view this crime. Phoenix: There's no way Maya is that Lady Kee'ra vigilante! Ema: I agree on a personal level, but the police are just going with what today's trial concluded. Phoenix: Ngrk! (I really blew it in court today.) Present Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report Ema: Based on the estimated time of death, we believe he was killed during the rite itself. It appears he was stabbed in the upper back with a dagger and died instantly. Phoenix: But there were so many people here. How could no one have noticed? Ema: I know. I can't believe it, either. I guess they were just that focused on their prayers or something. Warbaa'd Dagger Ema: Maya's fingerprints were found on the dagger that was used in the murder. The police are, therefore, investigating her as their prime suspect. Rayfa: The evidence is irrefutable, with no room for argument. Ema: I really don't want to treat Maya as a suspect, but... ...based on the evidence and police reports I've received so far, it's not looking good. Phoenix: (Not good? More like, how could it get any worse?) After clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag: Phoenix: Okay... That message on the prayer flag seems a little weird, but... Before clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House Phoenix: ...I think I've seen everything there is to see around here. Rayfa: You have not found or heard anything of particular worth. Are you ready to give up? Phoenix: No, I'm not calling it quits yet! Ema: ...D-Does it look like you have any hope of winning, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ema... I can't really say at this point. All I know is I have to keep investigating. Rayfa: What are you two sneaks up to? I would advise you to get back to work if you are done here, Detective. Otherwise, I will report you to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi for dereliction of duty. Ema: I-I-I, I'm going, I'm going! Well, see you later, Mr. Wright. And good luck! Phoenix: (I should really pay a visit to everyone and every place connected with this case.) After clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House Phoenix: ...I'm not sure it's related to this case. Rayfa: We have paid a visit to all of the people and places connected with this case. I think it is about time you prepared yourself for the inevitable. Don't you? Ema: ...D-Does it look like you have any hope of winning, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ema... I can't really say at this point. All I know is I have to keep investigating. Rayfa: What are you two sneaks up to? I would advise you to get back to work if you are done here, Detective. Otherwise, I will report you to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi for dereliction of duty. Ema: I-I-I, I'm going, I'm going! Well, see you later, Mr. Wright. And good luck! Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Is it not time to give up? Phoenix: No, there is still someone I need to talk to first. May 11High Priest's House Phoenix: Hello. I'm sorry to bother you again, but... Beh'leeb: Oh, it's you. Rayfa: Barbed Head! You are not contemplating casting suspicion upon Lady Beh'leeb, are you? She lost her beloved husband, and now Acolyte Zeh'lot, who was like a son to her. Phoenix: Of course, I'm not. But since she was close to both victims, I wanted to hear what she has to say. Rayfa: ...Very well. Phoenix: (And then there's the fact that Lady Kee'ra didn't attack Mrs. Inmee. That probably means she isn't a rebel.) Beh'leeb: Is this about poor Puhray? Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think I can talk about that right now. Phoenix: ...B-But what about Maya? She's innocent. Beh'leeb: Maya? I heard she was found guilty. First, my dear husband, and now Puhray? Phoenix: Mrs. Inmee, you don't really believe that Maya is the killer, do you? Beh'leeb: I-I... I don't know. But that was the verdict, so what else can I believe? What am I to do? Phoenix: The verdict was already reached in your husband's case... ...but the truth of the matter is yet to be found! Beh'leeb: How can you be so sure? Phoenix: ...Because I believe that Maya is innocent. That is all I have right now -- my faith in her. So please. Help me understand what happened. Beh'leeb: So you're... you're defending her based solely on faith? Even though you'll be punished for abetting the accused? Phoenix: That's right. Beh'leeb: ...A-All right, then. Your faith has moved me. I will tell you what I can. Rayfa: A-Are you sure about this, Lady Beh'leeb? Beh'leeb: \"My lovely wife is also a devout follower of Khura'inism. As such, she is not one to make light of another's faith. But if I find that you have lied about your faith in Maya Fey's innocence... ...I shall curse your entire family and all your disciples for the next eight generations.\" Phoenix: (Hey! Leave Athena and Apollo alone, buddy!) Examine Photo frame near TV Phoenix: A photo of the high priest, his wife, Acolyte Zeh'lot, and Maya... Since Maya's in it... ...it must've been taken the day before the rite. I should ask Mrs. Inmee about it. Family Photo added to the Court Record. Rayfa: To think that this would be their final family photo... That no-good Maya Fey has some nerve. I mean, here she is posing with the two men whom she would soon kill. Phoenix: I beg to differ. I see this photo as proof that she didn't kill them. Rayfa: Hmph. That smile of hers does not fool me. I sense a deep and abiding malice behind it. Phoenix: (I'll prove Maya's smile is the real deal!) Photo frame near TV (subsequent times, before presenting Family Photo) Phoenix: A photo of the high priest, his wife, Acolyte Zeh'lot, and Maya...

Photo frame near TV (after presenting Family Photo) Phoenix: It's that family photo they took. Mrs. Inmee said it was taken the day before the rite. I don't suppose any of them could've possibly imagined what was to come... Talk Puhray Zeh'lot Phoenix: How did Acolyte Zeh'lot end up living here as your husband's disciple? Beh'leeb: About two years ago, while my husband was at a spiritual retreat in the mountains... ...he came across Puhray collapsed on the ground. That's when he brought him here. You were always one to help those in need, weren't you, dear? Phoenix: ...And he'd been living here ever since? (About two years ago... That's around the same time Maya arrived in Khura'in.) Beh'leeb: Yes, he was born in a poor village and had nowhere to call home. My husband felt pity for the boy, so he took him in as his disciple. ...But not only as his disciple. He was like a member of our family, too. Phoenix: I see. (If this is where Acolyte Zeh'lot lived... ...there might be something I could learn about him lying around here.) The day before (appears after presenting Family Photo) Beh'leeb: This photo was taken during the Feast of Blessings. Phoenix: The Feast of Blessings? Beh'leeb: Yes. It is forbidden to eat during the days of the rite, so the day before it's performed... ...we enjoyed dishes full of gingihl, an herb known to strengthen the body and mind. You loved the gingihl-based dishes I make, didn't you, dear? Phoenix: Gingihl... I heard you can go three days without sleeping after eating some. Beh'leeb: Yes, but many foreigners don't care for it because of its strong smell. Our customs say that these dishes can only be eaten the day before the Purification Rite... ...and only between noon and 3 PM. Phoenix: That's pretty specific. Is it because the smell is too strong? Beh'leeb: A very good guess, indeed. It is to ensure the smell is gone by the time Lady Kee'ra is welcomed the next day. Phoenix: Wow, is it really that strong? (Come to think of it, the evening before the murder... ...an overwhelming odor was all over town. It was like a cross between garlic and mint.) Beh'leeb: After the Feast of Blessings, Puhray went over to the plaza to begin his supplication. I never thought that would be the last time I would see him. Phoenix: What was Maya doing at the time? Beh'leeb: Shortly after Puhray left, she went to the temple to prepare for the rite. ...I don't know what she did after that. Beh'leeb's Statement added to the Court Record. Phoenix: So, Acolyte Zeh'lot went out to pray the afternoon before the rite? (According to the newspaper... ...on the day before the rite, the plaza was so cold, the whole place had iced over.) Beh'leeb: Puhray always prayed a lot -- far more than anyone I have ever known. He was a devout young man whose faith was twice as strong as others. Phoenix: (I don't know why, but that's... kinda intimidating to me...) The day before (subsequent times) Beh'leeb: This photo was taken during the Feast of Blessings. Phoenix: The Feast of Blessings?

He has joined my husband in the Twilight Realm. He was so full of life before he went out to the plaza. Rayfa: This must be most difficult for you. It is like losing a family member. Beh'leeb: What's that, dear? ...Yes, you're right. I don't know what would've become of me if my husband were not here by my side. Phoenix: Umm... Is there anything you can tell me about Acolyte Zeh'lot that might help? Rayfa: He was a kindly young man. Let us leave it at that. Family Photo Phoenix: Can I ask you about this photo? Beh'leeb: It was taken during the Feast of Blessings, the day before the rite was held. Phoenix: The Feast of Blessings? Would you mind telling me a little more about it? After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: (I thought I'd have made some progress by now. But I haven't come across any particularly insightful information, even here.) Rayfa: You seem disappointed. Phoenix: Mrs. Inmee, is there anything else you could tell me? Beh'leeb: Forgive me. But if I keep thinking about those two any longer... Rayfa: Barbed Head... Phoenix: Yes, I understand. Thank you for your help. I'm sorry to have troubled you. Before clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag in Plaza of Devotion Rayfa: You have not found or heard anything of particular worth. Are you ready to give up? Phoenix: No, I'm not calling it quits yet! After clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag in Plaza of Devotion Rayfa: We have paid a visit to all of the people and places connected with this case. I think it is about time you prepared yourself for the inevitable. Don't you? Tehm'pul Temple Present Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report Rayfa: Ah, the second murder victim. Phoenix: Did you know Acolyte Zeh'lot, too, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: I knew of him. I know he had been living under the care of Abbot Inmee at his home, but little else. Phoenix: You mean like how they're letting me stay at the temple? Rayfa: Are you seriously trying to insult the poor victim with your comparison, you filthy dog? Phoenix: (Hey! What was THAT comparison for?!) Warbaa'd Dagger Rayfa: That is the sacred dagger used in the Purification Rite. In using it for murder, the vile criminal known as Maya Fey shall be cursed for all eternity. Phoenix: Nothing's been proven yet, so stop treating her like a criminal! Rayfa: How do explain the accused's fingerprints all over the dagger, then? And the fact that Abbot Inmee was slain with this very weapon? Phoenix: (I-I hate it when I have no comeback...!) After clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag in Plaza of Devotion and clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House: May 11Detention Center Maya: ............... Phoenix: (Maya sure looks tired.) I'm so sorry, Maya. I failed to defend you during that trial earlier today. Maya: I'm sorry, too, Nick. I never meant to get caught up in this whole mess. Even worse, I got you caught up in it, too, and you were convicted under that stupid law. Nick... You should really withdraw from this case. Maybe they'll even commute your sentence if you do! Phoenix: I-I could never abandon you like that! You might not believe me, but I'm going to pull off a win somehow. Maya: It's not like I don't believe in you, it's just... Phoenix: Don't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside out and upside down! You'll see! Maya: O-Okay... Rayfa: ..................... Phoenix: You're awfully quiet, Your Benevolence. Rayfa: It is only a matter of time until your executions are carried out. I simply thought I would allow you two a good talk before you depart from this world. Phoenix: Sorry, but we're not giving up yet. And we won't till the bitter end. Rayfa: There is no need to put on a brave face. Your fates were sealed with today's verdict. Worry not of Maya Fey. The Twilight Realm will cleanse the taint from that neophyte practitioner's soul. Then, perhaps, the Holy Mother may finally forgive her. Maya: ............... Phoenix: (Wait... Was that her attempt at comforting me?) Rayfa: Barbed Head, further resistance shall come to naught. Stop your desperate struggle. Accept the judgment that has been passed upon you. Phoenix: (She obviously doesn't know me very well.) Rayfa: Then, perhaps, your sentence will be commuted, and-- Maya: Hold it right there, Your Benevolence. Why do you always have to be like that? Phoenix: M-Maya, what are you... Rayfa: Wh-What is the matter? I was simply showing some mercy upon your souls. Maya: Nick here is risking his life to defend me. Rayfa: And that is why I told you it will come to nau-- Maya: No, it won't! Nick is just doing what lawyers are supposed to! He's defending his client, no matter what! Rayfa: Enough! There is no place for lawyers in the Hall of Justice! For we have the Divination S\u00e9ance! Maya: But your Insights were wrong! Rayfa: Nnngrrrr... Phoenix: (Ooh boy, that's gotta hurt.) Maya: Don't you get it? Errors are bound to happen if your Insights are accepted without question. So I ask you, royal priestess: What is your true duty? Do the victims' souls or the Holy Mother herself wish you to judge people in error? Rayfa: Oooooh... You dare bring Her Holiness's name into this?! You know nothing, you... you... phony baloney! Phoenix: P-Please, you two! Enough already! Maya: S-Sorry, Nick. I got a little carried away. That's not really like me, huh? Aha ha ha. Phoenix: No, I should be thanking you, Maya. It's good to have you in my corner. Rayfa: Hrrnh... How dare you mock me so! You will not get away with this! I was a fool to show you compassion. And to think I could convince you to accept your fate. So struggle all you want in the Hall of Justice tomorrow. You will receive your just desserts, as the scorn of our kingdom is heaped upon you! Phoenix: (...I can see straight through that contorted smile on your face, you know. *sigh* She may say these terrible things... ...but it's just the way she was raised, I guess.) Examine Bell Maya: A guard will come running if you ring that bell there. Phoenix: Really? Let's put that to the test, shall we? *jingle, jingle* Maya: Oh, but they got really mad last time when I rang it for no reason. Phoenix: You could've told me that before I rang it! Talk Zeh'lot's murder Phoenix: Could you try to remember what happened one more time? Maya: I've been trying as hard as I can... But I can't remember anything from the middle of the rite onward. Phoenix: Oh, right. You suddenly felt sleepy, and everything after that's a blank. Maya: Even so, I didn't kill anyone! And I'm not the one going around dressed like Lady Kee'ra! ...Although it's kind of cool to think there's a mysterious female vigilante out there. Phoenix: R-Right... Puhray Zeh'lot Phoenix: Were you close to Acolyte Zeh'lot? Maya: Umm... We met several times during the meetings about the rite. But I didn't know him very well. He seemed pretty quiet. Phoenix: Didn't you eat together the day before the rite? Maya: Yeah! We ate this one super-stinky dish, but it was actually really good! I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it was love at first bite! Like... You know the salty noodles at Eldoon's Noodles? It's like if you added garlic and herbs to that, and then let it simmer for a really long time. Phoenix: (Sounds more like a hot pot than ramen to me at that point...) Maya: *sigh* Now I miss ramen, too... Phoenix: Umm... so what was Acolyte Zeh'lot like while you were eating? Maya: ...He seemed to be enjoying the food. But as soon as we were done, he left to go pray. Phoenix: And what did you do? Maya: Oh, umm... I returned to the temple to prepare for the rite. Phoenix: (That coincides with Mrs. Inmee's description of events.) Lady Kee'ra's identity (appears after \"Puhray Zeh'lot\") Phoenix: Any idea who might be pretending to be Lady Kee'ra? Maya: Hmm... When the rite started, it was just me and Abbot Inmee. Phoenix: But the S\u00e9ance vision showed a third figure who looked like Lady Kee'ra. Maya: I know... *sigh* Lady Kee'ra... I wish I could've seen her in the flesh. Phoenix: Umm, yeah... (Let's stay focused on the case, shall we?) It was supposed to have been impossible for a third party to enter the Inner Sanctum. Maya: Ah! But what if she came from the sky? You know, like that bushy-bearded paratrooper! That mountain would've been no match for Lady Kee'ra's wings! Phoenix: That's from the Plumed Punisher TV show, right? Maya: H-How'd you know? Phoenix: Because the real Lady Kee'ra doesn't have wings. Maya: Ooh! I've got it this time! There must be a secret room with a secret door at the Inner Sanctum! Did you know there are eighty-eight secret Plumed Punisher bases here in Khura'in? Phoenix: Can we please stop talking about the Plumed Punisher show for a sec, Maya? Maya: I guess so. *sigh* Keeping it real is much harder than it looks. Present Plumed Punisher Strap Maya: It's my Plumed Punisher strap! There's only one of them in the entire world! I'll treasure it for the rest of my life! Phoenix: .........Your Benevolence? I can't help but notice how hard you're staring at this strap. Rayfa: M-Me?! Want that?! Sorry, but you are sorely mistaken! Maya: Hey, Your Benevolence? Would you let me out of here in exchange for the strap? Rayfa: ....................................... ...What a preposterous idea! Phoenix: (It didn't stop you from entertaining it, though, did it?) Lady Kee'ra's Warning Maya: Nick, I'm not the one going around impersonating Lady Kee'ra. Phoenix: I know, Maya. I believe you. Rayfa: Oh, please. Dispense with this bungling act. Phoenix: I'm going to prove that Maya isn't Lady Kee'ra. Rayfa: Why bother? She is already as good as guilty. And floundering about will not change that fact. Phoenix: I don't care. I'll keep fighting until the very last crack of His Magistry's gavel! Rayfa: Hmph. You truly are...a nincompoop. Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report Maya: First Abbot Inmee, and now Acolyte Zeh'lot... Rayfa: Spare me your crocodile tears. We both know it was YOU who slew those pious men! Maya: N-No, it wasn't me! Nick... How can we make her understand? Phoenix: Probably only by getting to the bottom of things in court tomorrow... Warbaa'd Dagger Maya: I can't believe the sacred dagger was used in a murder. Rayfa: Only a truly irreverent individual would dare do such a thing. And it was your fingerprints that were found upon the weapon. How do you explain that? Maya: I used the dagger during our rehearsals! That's why it has my fingerprints on it. Rayfa: And how do I know you are not lying? Maya: Ugh... Why won't you believe me? Phoenix: Just let it go, Maya. There's no changing her mind right now... Family Photo Maya: We took this picture during the Feast of Blessings... ...before all of these unthinkably tragic things happened... Rayfa: Unthinkable? I doubt that. You were surely plotting your murderous rampage at the time. Maya: I was thinking of nothing of the sort -- especially not during that meal! The smell of gingihl was so strong, I couldn't think of anything else. Rayfa: Yes, well, it IS a rather intense aroma... Phoenix: (Wow... Do I even want to know how strong of a smell gingihl gives off up close...?) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Well, I should get going now. Maya: ...Sorry I wasn't any help. Phoenix: Don't worry. I've got this. We'll beat the charges tomorrow and be on the first plane back home before you know it. Then we'll go grab dinner at Eldoon's, or your favorite burger joint! You pick! Maya: ...Sounds good! I think I'll get the extra-large Hamburg steak topping on my salty bowl! Best of both worlds! Phoenix: You can have whatever you like! (But first, I have to beat the charges.) Maya: Ah! I almost forgot! Phoenix: Ack! Wh-What is it? Maya: I have a favor to ask. Phoenix: Okay... But why are we whispering? Maya: I forgot I left something at the high priest's house. It's super important! Would you mind getting and holding on to it for me? Phoenix: Sure. So what's this super important thing? Maya: In my bag, you'll find a folding book. It's only given to the priestess who performs the rite. It's called the Tome of Secrets. Phoenix: That does sound important. How could you leave something like that just lying around? (That explains all the whispering. If Rayfa found out, all heck would break loose.) Maya: Look, it's got Lady Kee'ra's real name written in it, so... Oops! Don't tell anyone I told you that! In fact, just forget I said anything at all! It's supposed to be a secret! Phoenix: The Tome of Secrets contains... secrets? Imagine that. Rayfa: Hm? What are you two whispering about? Phoenix: Oh, um, n-nothing. It's just she forgot something, so I told her I'd go get it. Rayfa: ...You are up to something, I just know it. Maya: Thanks, Nick! I'm counting on you! Tehm'pul Temple, Plaza of Devotion, Inner Sanctum, Detention Center, or Bazaar Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: So, are you ready to give up, Barbed Head? Any more of this and you will cause Lady Inmee to suffer more than she already is. Phoenix: I understand what you mean, but I can't give up that easily. After all, I have to defend Maya in court. Rayfa: Stubborn fool. ...But you have already been found guilty. If you wish to continue floundering about, I suppose now is your last chance. Phoenix: I'll take every chance I can get. What to do Rayfa: What? Have you given up already? Phoenix: Not even close! Still, it does feel like I'm barely treading water over here. Rayfa: Water? Do all the people of your country go for a swim when they are troubled? If so, seek the rivers on the edge of town. There you will find all the water you need. Go ahead, paddle to your heart's content! Phoenix: (English idioms go right over her head.) May 11High Priest's House Phoenix: Hello? Anybody home? No answer... Mrs. Inmee's probably out right now. Well, I'll just get what I came for. Rayfa: I am watching you like a warbaa'd, Barbed Head! You had better not steal anything! Phoenix: I would never do something like that! I'm just here to get what Maya asked for! Rayfa: Then get on with it. Phoenix: I would if you'd stop interrupting me... Examine Handbag Leads to: \"Ah, here's Maya's bag.\" Phoenix: (Ah, here's Maya's bag.) Rayfa: Hm? What is that strange patch on her bag? Phoenix: It's the Steel Samurai. He's the hero of an action-hero show back in my country. It's actually Maya's favorite show. She's got all sorts of merchandise related to it. Rayfa: I see... He looks strikingly similar to the Plumed Punisher. Phoenix: They are similar, but... (...the Steel Samurai definitely came first.) Rayfa: I see... How interesting... Phoenix: (Rayfa seems genuinely intrigued. There must a common thread between Plumed Punisher and Steel Samurai fans. Come to think of it... ...didn't Maya mention something about trading with a Plumed Punisher fan? But I digress... I'd better find what she asked me to look for and get going.) Let's see here... This must be that Tome of Secrets that Maya was talking about. Tome of Secrets added to the Court Record. Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Are you finished now? Phoenix: Hold on a second. The string around it is coming undone... Whoops! Oh...! Rayfa: AHHHHH! YOU FOOL! Do not lay eyes upon it! Put it away! Quickly! Before we go blind! Phoenix: Relax. My hand just slipped. Rayfa: This is the Tome of Secrets! Are you trying to get us cursed?! Lady Kee'ra is liable to swoop down and gouge our eyes out! Phoenix: Oh, right. This book is related to Lady Kee'ra, isn't it? Your Benevolence, would you mind if I asked you some questions? Rayfa: Hmph... Examine Handbag Rayfa: What is that strange patch on her bag again? Phoenix: It's for the Steel Samurai, this action hero back in my country. Rayfa: It looks so similar to the Plumed Punisher -- strikingly so. Hmm, I see... \"The Steel Samurai\"... Phoenix: You're actually interested in it, aren't you? Rayfa: Wh-Whatever gave you that idea?! Move Rayfa: Where do you think you are going, Barbed Head? Were you not the one who said you wished to speak with me? Phoenix: (I better stay here and talk to Rayfa for now.) Talk Tome of Secrets Rayfa: This is not something I would normally speak about to an outsider such as you. Phoenix: Well, can't you make an exception?! Rayfa: If you insist... Nayna! What of this folding book? ...Yes, I see... This very important tome is bestowed upon the priestess in the Purification Rite. Phoenix: *gulp* Very important? Wh-What's written inside? Rayfa: Yes, yes... Yes, I see... ...Really? Is it all right to reveal that? Phoenix: ...Um, uhhh... Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Patience, patience! The book contains Lady Kee'ra's true name. Phoenix: Her true name? Is a name really that important of a secret? Rayfa: To a Khura'inist priestess, a person's name is one of the most important things to know. Lady Kee'ra's real name (appears after \"Tome of Secrets\") Phoenix: What's so important about a name? Rayfa: Without a name, a priestess's voice will fail to reach a person's mitamah. It is much like trying to send a letter without the recipient's address. A spirit can only be identified once you know the deceased's face and name. Phoenix: Oh, I get it. It's like when you see someone in a crowd you recognize, but you don't know their name. It makes it impossible to get their attention. Rayfa: Indeed. You must know a spirit's face and true name before you can commune with it. It is the same for Khura'inism's most secret art, one that my mother alone may use. Phoenix: The queen has a secret art? Rayfa: Hmph, it is something a foreigner such as you could never hope to guess. Maya: In Khura'inism, spirit channeling is a secret art that can only be performed by the queen. No one else is supposed to be able to do it. Phoenix: (I should pretend this is all new to me. Besides, I get the feeling she secretly really wants to tell me all about it.) The queen's secret art (appears after \"Lady Kee'ra's real name\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about this secret art of the queen you spoke of? Rayfa: Come again? Phoenix: Oh, sorry. Maybe we shouldn't talk about this. It IS a secret after all, right? Rayfa: It is the secret art of spirit channeling. But I suppose those words are meaningless to you. Phoenix: I'm just surprised how willing you are to tell me about it. Rayfa: A third-rate lawyer could not channel spirits simply by learning of the technique. Phoenix: (Third-rate is a bit harsh. I'd even settle for second.) Rayfa: What is it? You have the look of a tentacled hag frog upon your face. Phoenix: (What the heck is a tentacled hag frog?!) ...Spirit channeling... That's where a medium lets a spirit possess her body to return to our world, right? Rayfa: Well now. I see you have done your homework. Phoenix: Oh, I guess I studied a bit. Eh heh. Rayfa: With the power of spirit channeling, one can bring back even the most ancient of spirits! It is quite a magnificent power, is it not? Phoenix: (I've never seen her eyes light up like this before.) I imagine they're pretty shocked when they come back from ancient times. Rayfa: Indeed. A spirit's memory is cut off at the moment of death. Phoenix: So even a spirit that is brought back after centuries doesn't sense any gap in time... ...between the moment of its death, and the moment it is channeled? Rayfa: Yes, and yet, it clearly recalls all of the memories it had in life. Thus, even heroes and scholars of antiquity can be channeled and directly learned from. Our queens have also used this power to help the rulers of neighboring lands seek counsel. That is why we have never been invaded, and how we have maintained our unique culture. Phoenix: So, spirit channeling is a really effective tool for international politics. Rayfa: It is, indeed. And that is why only those with the power to channel spirits may rule our kingdom. But of late, there has been an endless influx of illegal immigrants from neighboring lands. The fools come seeking the same great power as my mother. Phoenix: Illegal immigrants? Rayfa: Yes. It is becoming quite a problem. Some have lost their way in life, and look to Khura'inism for their salvation. Among them are also those of dubious nature, who have been driven from their own lands. Phoenix: (Dubious nature... Driven from their own land... Gaspen Payne definitely fit that bill. But they sure weren't treating him like an illegal alien.) Rayfa's spiritual power (appears after \"The queen's secret art\") Leads to: \"Can you channel spirits, Your Benevolence?\" Present Tome of Secrets Rayfa: You fool! Why have you put the Tome of Secrets before me?! Phoenix: What's the big deal? Rayfa: S-Stay back! Come no closer! Phoenix: (Hey, this thing's actually pretty useful!) Lookie here, Your Benevolence. It's the Tome of Seeecrets. Rayfa: If you do not desist this instant, I shall have you put to death for the crime of blasphemy! Phoenix: Urk! S-Sorry! (...If looks could kill, I'd already be dead.) Phoenix: Can you channel spirits, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: I am but the royal priestess. There is still much that I must learn. As of now, the Divination S\u00e9ance takes me to the very limit of my ability. Phoenix: (So, her spiritual power doesn't measure up to Maya's.) Rayfa: ...You were just mocking me in your mind, weren't you? Phoenix: D-Don't be ridiculous! Rayfa: It is written all over your face! You... impudent nincompoop! The Divination S\u00e9ance was once one of the important roles fulfilled by the queen. That is what my mother taught me when I was little. Phoenix: (So the queen can perform the Dance of Devotion? That'd be a sight to see.) Rayfa: Someday, I will be a powerful priestess and queen, just like my mother. And the Divination S\u00e9ance is a vital part of my training to prepare me for that day! Phoenix: F-Forgive my ignorance, Your Benevolence. Rayfa: Hmph, you shall see. It will not be long before I, too, master the secret art of spirit channeling! I will be a magnificent queen who unites her people for the greater good of Khura'in! Phoenix: (Now I see... Spirit channeling is something she really aspires to.) Maya: I'm going to ace that test and become the next master! After all, I can't let my clan and the other villagers down. Phoenix: (It looks like she actually has something in common with Maya.) Rayfa: Are you quite through now? There are more important things to do than to stand here and talk about spirit channeling. Phoenix: (That's true. It doesn't have anything to do with this case, as far as I can tell. Or does it...?) Umm... If the queen is a spirit medium... Rayfa: Are you about to suggest that my mother was channeling Lady Kee'ra? Phoenix: Ack! (I guess she saw that one coming.) Rayfa: Hmph, lawyers are indeed a witless breed! On the day of the rite, my mother was engaged in other duties at the palace. Phoenix: Of course... Rayfa: My mother is a very busy woman. And the idea itself is preposterous. Do you truly believe the queen of Khura'in would personally battle the insurgents? This is precisely what makes you third-rate! Phoenix: Urk! (Another dead end! This is bad!) A-Anyway, I need to continue looking for leads, so... ???: Over there! After him! Don't let him escape! Rayfa: What is all that racket? What? That escaped prisoner has surfaced here in town? Phoenix: Escaped prisoner? You mean... that guy with the bushy beard? Rayfa: There is no reason to panic. The police are on his trail. Phoenix: (He's no longer a suspect... But he might know something, considering he was at the scene of the crime.) Let's go take a look! Rayfa: Wait! May 11Khura'in - Bazaar Phoenix: *huff* *puff* Oww, my aching back. I forgot how badly I'd injured it. Ow, ow, ow... I need to do some stretching and exercise more when I get back home. ???: Ah, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: *huff* *puff* ...H-Hey, Ahlbi. Datz... Are'bal... Have you seen hi-- Ow, ow, ow! Ahlbi: A-Are you all right, sir? Phoenix: One second... *huff* *puff* *wheeeeeze* Have you seen... that escaped prisoner around here? Ahlbi: Oh, so that's why all those police came rushing over here. I heard them saying something about an escaped prisoner disappearing in this area. Phoenix: He disappeared in this area? He couldn't have taken to the air again, could he? Rayfa: Barbed Head! *huff* *huff* I told you to wait! Phoenix: It's too dangerous for you around here, Your Benevolence. Mr. Are'bal could be lurking nearby! Rayfa: What sort of a princess would I be if all it took was an escaped prisoner to frighten me?! Phoenix: (She's fearless, I'll give her that.) I can't be responsible if something happens to you. (As long as I'm here, though, I might as well search the area myself. Hmm... If I were an escaped prisoner, where would I hide?) Examine Manhole Phoenix: That manhole cover... It's open! Shah'do: Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff! Ahlbi: Whoa! What is it, Shah'do?! Phoenix: Did he sniff out someone or something in the manhole? (Hmm, I wonder...) Could Shah'do track Mr. Are'bal if he had something with the rebel's scent on it? Ahlbi: I-I don't know... Phoenix: (I feel like I've got something with Mr. Are'bal's scent on it... Something he might've touched...) Talk Any ideas? Phoenix: Have you noticed anything around here? Ahlbi: I haven't seen the escaped prisoner. But I did notice how slow you run, sir. Phoenix: (It's just the high elevation. I'm out of breath before I know it!) What to do Ahlbi: The police said the escaped prisoner vanished right around here. Phoenix: Hmm, there aren't any really good hiding places, so where could he have gone? Ahlbi: Maybe he melted into the crowd. Phoenix: You should be careful, Your Benevolence. Rayfa: You need not tell me that! I am not a child, after all! Phoenix: Okay, okay... Present Plumed Punisher Strap Ahlbi: That is THE Plumed Punisher strap. There's only one in the entire world! Phoenix: Oh, do you know a lot about the Plumed Punisher? Ahlbi: Of course! She's a real hero to the people! Phoenix: The ratings for the show must be through the roof. Ahlbi: They are! It reached 100 percent viewership at one point! Phoenix: One hundred percent?! Ahlbi: Well, when there's only one TV channel in the entire kingdom... Phoenix: Oh, that explains it. Warbaa'd Dagger Ahlbi: That's the dagger that was used in the rite. It's said that Lady Kee'ra once wielded it. In addition to that dagger, there are many other items that are said to have been hers. Phoenix: Really? Like what? Ahlbi: There's the obvious stuff, like swords, spears, and other weapons. But there are other, more interesting items, like her favorite hat and her favorite pillow. Phoenix: Her pillow...? Ahlbi: Yes. They say if you use it, Lady Kee'ra will ensure you have a restful slumber. Phoenix: As long as it's not eternal... Brand New Flag (after examining manhole) Leads to: \"Here, Shah'do. How about this?\" Phoenix: Here, Shah'do. How about this? I hope it works... Shah'do: Grrr... Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff! Phoenix: I think he's picked up a scent! You mind if I borrow Shah'do for a bit?! Ahlbi: By all means! I had no idea you could do this! Yeah! Go get 'im, boy! Shah'do: Ruff, ruff, ruff! Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I'm heading down the manhole now. It could be dangerous, so please wait here! Rayfa: Wait! Phoenix: Don't worry, I won't commit any of those misdeeds you're so worried about. Rayfa: That is not what I fear! There may be a vicious insurgent lurking down there! Phoenix: Oh, are you worried about me? Rayfa: No. I was simply wondering why you would go to such lengths in your investigation. After all, if you would simply withdraw from this case, they might commute your sentence. Phoenix: I'm doing this to prove Maya innocent. Rayfa: But how can you be so sure of the accused's innocence?! She has already been found guilty! Phoenix: Don't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside out and upside down! You'll see! Maya: O-Okay... Phoenix: I believe in her. If she says she's innocent, then that means she's innocent. Lawyers must trust in their clients to the bitter end. That's just what we do. Rayfa: ......... You... lamebrain. Do what you will! Phoenix: Well, I'm going in! Let's go, Shah'do! Shah'do: Ruff, ruff! Ahlbi: Be careful! Shah'do!: Ruff, ruff! Phoenix: W-Wait! Come back here! It's pitch black down here. I can't see a thing. *WHAM* Phoenix: Aaagh! Phoenix: Ooogh... Owww owww owwww... What happened? I went down into the manhole, and then... ???: Oh, ya finally came to? Phoenix: Ah! (I'd remember that face anywhere! And that dragon symbol on his armband... That's the mark of the rebels! There can be no mistake! It's him -- Datz Are'bal!) YIKES! Datz: Sorry I got a little rough with ya back there. Thought ya were the cops. Why ya making that face? ...Hey, want an apple? Phoenix: (Whew...I thought he was going to kill me.) I-I'll pass on the apple, but thanks. (I don't mind a good apple, but not right now.) What is this place? Datz: This is the office of my brother in arms, Dhurke! But right now, we're using it as a rebel safe house! Phoenix: Wait, back up a sec. What kind of office is this exactly? Datz: A law office, what else?! Phoenix: Really?! Dhurke used to be a lawyer?! Datz: Yep! Just like you! Phoenix: (Khura'in's public enemy number one is an ex-lawyer? Didn't see that coming.) Datz: But I don't suppose I'll be coming 'round here anymore. Phoenix: You won't? Are you planning to flee or something? Datz: It's just... I wanna get outta the rebel business. Tired o' being hounded by the cops and all that. So I came by today to pick up the last o' my stuff. Phoenix: R-Really...? Datz: I'm gonna sell Dhurke's info to the minister o' justice, then slip outta Khura'in! Phoenix: ...W-Wait a second! You're a key person of interest in this case! You can't go running off like that! Datz: Relax, will ya? I'll tell ya whatever ya need to know. Oh, and sorry about punching your lights out back there. My bad! So, Mr. Lawyer Man, whaddaya wanna know? Phoenix: Tell me about the murders of the high priest Tahrust Inmee, and his acolyte Puhray Zeh'lot. Datz: Sure, I'll tell ya whatever I can. Don't know if it'll be much help, though. I mean, I'm not a rebel anymore, so... Phoenix: (I wonder how true that really is...) Examine Picture of Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in Phoenix: (There's a knife driven deep into a photo of the queen. I guess the rebels really hate her. I better remember to stay on their good side.) White flowers Phoenix: Incense and white flowers... (The flowers are still fresh. They must've been put here maybe today or yesterday.) Did you put these here, Mr. Are'bal? Datz: ...Something wrong with flowers? Phoenix: Oh, no! Datz: It's just a traditional thing here in Khura'in. Pay it no mind. Ladder Phoenix: There's a ladder leading underground. He must've brought me in through there. But there's no reason for me to leave yet. I should see what else Mr. Are'bal has to say. Photos Phoenix: This looks like a photo of Dhurke and his compatriots... And here's one that looks really old... Wow, this was taken about twenty years ago. Datz: Those are Dhurke's sons. Phoenix: Really? So this is the rebel Dhurke in the center? He doesn't look so evil. And both of his sons... look kind of familiar... Datz: The one on the left is Yuty. Oh, but you know him as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi is Dhurke's son?! Datz: That he is! Yuty was once a rebel, too! He used to really respect his old man... ...both as a father and as a lawyer. Phoenix: Then why'd he become a prosecutor? Datz: Being a lawyer in this kingdom is the same as signing your own death warrant. Phoenix: On account of the Defense Culpability Act, right? Datz: Yeah. That's why Yuty decided to be a prosecutor instead. He wanted to spark a revolution from the inside, so he dove right into the enemy's den! Phoenix: I would've never guessed it, looking at him now. Datz: You can say that again. Dhurke is battling to change Khura'in's legal system. The will of the dragon spurs him on. We all thought Yuty was taking up the mantle to carry on that will, too... We were sure he'd help overthrow Ga'ran one day, but... As you've seen, he now uses the law to do her bidding. Dhurke's been beside himself. Phoenix: (So he no longer carries the will of the dragon in him, huh... I wonder what happened between father and son for it to come to this?) What about the other child in the photo? Datz: That's Dhurke's adopted son, but he's gone back overseas. His name's Apollo. Phoenix: (Apollo? Wait a second... That bracelet... It really IS Apollo!) Datz: He was a rascal, that one! And his voice could shake the entire room! I imagine he's out there raising high hell somewhere! Phoenix: Ha, aha ha... Yes, I'm sure he's doing just fine. (Considering how far he's come, Mr. Are'bal's description really doesn't do Apollo justice!) Phoenix: ............Apollo! I've been watching you grow over these past two years. That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo. Apollo: ...Thank you! I'll... I'll be fine! Everything will be fine! Phoenix: (He's a responsible young man now. He never lost that loud voice, though.) Photos (subsequent times) Phoenix: This looks like a photo of Dhurke and his compatriots... And here's one that's really old... Datz: Those are Dhurke's sons. The one on the left is Prosecutor Sahdmadhi when he was younger. I used to call him Yuty. Thought he'd carry on the will of the dragon and become a fine lawyer, but... Phoenix: And the other child is...? Datz: That's Dhurke's adopted son, but he's gone back overseas. His name's Apollo. Phoenix: (That name, and that bracelet... Yep, that has to be our Apollo.) Datz: He was a rascal, that one! And his voice could shake the entire room! I imagine he's out there raising high hell somewhere! Phoenix: Ha, aha ha... Yes, I'm sure he's doing just fine. (Considering how far he's come, Mr. Are'bal's description really doesn't do Apollo justice!) Lizards Phoenix: What are these hanging here? Lizards? ...If so, they're pretty big. Datz: Those're sewer lizards! We call 'em that 'cause they live in the sewer! They grow bigger than your average lizard, which makes 'em fine eating! Phoenix: Wait, you eat these? Datz: What else would ya do with 'em?! Here, try one! Phoenix: Pass! I'll definitely pass! Datz: ...You're missing out on a fine treat, my man! Phoenix: S-Somehow, I think I'll live without it. Food on table Phoenix: (There are bowls and platters of food here. ...They're still warm, as if this was all recently prepared.) You must have a pretty big appetite, Mr. Are'bal. Datz: Har har har har har! Guys as big and strong as me... Got even bigger appetites, y'know! Phoenix: But you just fled from the police. I don't know how you could eat this much after all that excitement. Ack! S-Sorry if I offended you! Datz: But first, let's start with an apple-tizer! Phoenix: (Where's he getting all those apples from?!) Datz: Wanna join me, Mr. Lawyer Man? Got plenty of sewer lizards, too! Phoenix: T-Thanks, but I already ate. Coat Phoenix: Is that coat yours, Mr. Are'bal? Datz: Nah, it belongs to the rebel leader Dhurke. Phoenix: It's pretty impressive. I like the color, too. Datz: ...Wanna try it on? Phoenix: Really? You sure it's okay? Datz: Of course. Bet it would look great on ya! Phoenix: Well then, don't mind if I do... ......... Ack! It smells all moldy! Datz: Haaaar har har har har! I can't believe ya fell for it! Haaar haaar! That thing's been hanging there forever! Phoenix: (Note to self: Don't trust this guy ever again.) Sign Phoenix: What's this thing with the dragon on it? Some kind of a sign? Datz: Yep. That was his business sign back when this was Dhurke's office. Phoenix: He used to be a lawyer, right? Datz: That he was, but it was a really long time ago. This place has seen better days, that's for sure. Phoenix: Well, I hope he can put his sign back up someday. Datz: .........I wouldn't hold my breath. TV or refrigerator Phoenix: You guys get electricity? Datz: Yeah, but the power goes out occasionally. Phoenix: That's pretty inconvenient. Datz: You're telling me! Sometimes, it goes out for an entire day. Phoenix: What about the stuff in the refrigerator? Datz: Why don't you see for yourself? Phoenix: Forget I asked! (I'm afraid of what I might find...) Book Phoenix: Is this... a law book? (A dragon mark's been branded into the cover.) Datz: That's Dhurke's law book. Phoenix: Really?! The leader of the rebels? That Dhurke? Datz: That's right. And that \"Mark of the Dragon\" is the emblem of the rebellion! Phoenix: Hmm, the pages in this one section are really dirty. Datz: Must be the section on the Defense Culpability Act. Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record. Phoenix: He must've done a ton of research on the Defense Culpability Act. He practically wore out the entire section. Book (subsequent times) Phoenix: Is this... a law book? (A dragon mark's been branded into the cover.) Datz: That's Dhurke's law book. Phoenix: Really?! The leader of the rebels? That Dhurke? Datz: That's right. And that \"Mark of the Dragon\" is the emblem of the rebellion! Phoenix: Hmm, the pages in this one section are really dirty. Datz: Must be the section on the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: He must've done a ton of research on the Defense Culpability Act. He practically wore out the entire section. Talk The high priest's murder Phoenix: Tell me everything you know about the high priest's murder. Datz: Uhh... Well, as ya know, I don't remember much about that. I banged my head on a rock as soon as I parachuted into the Inner Sanctum. So when I told you I had nothing to do with his murder, I meant it! Phoenix: Okay then, where were you when you came to after banging your head? Datz: Uhh... By the time I came to, it was already dawn. I musta been out cold the whole time! Phoenix: So you didn't see the crime happen at all...? Datz: ...Ya got that right! Phoenix: Then why did you say you did when you testified?! Datz: Oh, uhh... About that... Since I didn't remember a thing... ...I was afraid I'd seem suspicious, so I came up with that whole story! Phoenix: (Does he even realize how much trouble his big fat lie has caused me?) Datz: Sorry for the trouble! It was definitely my bad! Phoenix: (He doesn't seem very sorry to me!) So, the bottom line is you were at the scene of the crime, but weren't involved in it. Got it. Dhurke the attorney (appears after \"The high priest's murder\") Phoenix: So, Dhurke used to be a lawyer? Datz: Yep! He was a force to be reckoned with back when he was still practicing! He was a juggernaut of the law, and as mighty as a dragon! He could strike terror into a prosecutor's heart, just by glaring at him. People called it his \"dragon's glare.\" He even got criminals to confess and pass out with a well-placed glare! Phoenix: (You've got to be kidding me...) Datz: But most important of all, he would never surrender. He'd fight for the accused, no matter how the odds were stacked against him. Phoenix: Is that what you mean by the will of the dragon? Datz: Yep, that would be it! Actually... Your work in court yesterday was mighty impressive, too! You didn't give up, no matter how hard of a beating you took! ...Not unlike Dhurke, I might add! Phoenix: Oh, um... thanks. (Even if a big part of that beating I took was because of you...) Present Anything Datz: Is this a parting gift for me leaving the rebels? Phoenix: N-No, you can't keep it! (I'll just ask him what I can for now.) After clearing \"Dhurke the attorney\" Talk option and examining white flowers, photos, food on table, and book: Datz: Well, I gotta start packing. Who knows when they might catch up with me if I don't scram soon? Phoenix: Please, wait! I still need to ask you something. Datz: Go ahead, shoot. Phoenix: What are you rebels trying to do? Datz: .................. Phoenix: And why were you at the Inner Sanctum in the first place? Talk Mr. Are'bal's plan Phoenix: Why were you at the Inner Sanctum on the day of the murder? Or more precisely, what were you trying to do there? Datz: I was trying to escape from prison, that's all. But that high priest was a fool for getting taken in by Dhurke. He shoulda tried hightailing it outta Khura'in like I'm doing! 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: Ah... Psyche-Locks! (Mr. Are'bal is hiding something! But I won't know exactly what until I can undo the locks!) What exactly are you trying to hide, Mr. Are'bal? Datz: Huh? I'm not hiding anything! No way, no how! Phoenix: (...I'll just have to use my magatama on him, then.) Present Magatama Phoenix: 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Datz's Plan -- Phoenix: I'm going to ask you again: Why were you at the Inner Sanctum on the day of the murder? Or more precisely, what were you trying to do there? Datz: Ya can keep asking, but the answer's still the same. I was trying to escape from prison, that's all. ...But that high priest was a fool. He fell for Dhurke's line and sold his own country out. Phoenix: How can you say such things about him?! He helped you escape, didn't he? Don't you even care about what happened to him? Datz: Nope. I was getting out of the rebellion, anyway. He should've opened his eyes. We never stood a chance against the Ga'ran regime. Phoenix: Hang on. Do you really believe what you're saying? Didn't the high priest's death really hurt you on the inside? Datz: Like I just said, I couldn't care less about the whole thing! Phoenix: I beg to differ. This wouldn't be here in this room if you didn't feel a thing. Present Nahmanda Flower Phoenix: Leads to: \"I heard these flowers are offered in memory of the dead here in Khura'in.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: What does that have to do with anything? Phoenix: You don't know? Try looking deep into your heart. Datz: Umm... I still don't get it. But I'm starting to think you don't, either! Phoenix: (Arngh... Why does it feel so much worse when it's him who's pointing out my failures?) Datz: I told ya, I couldn't care less about the high priest! Phoenix: (Really...? Because I'm pretty sure I have something that points to his grief.) Leads back to: \"I beg to differ. This wouldn't be here in this room if you didn't feel a thing.\" Phoenix: I heard these flowers are offered in memory of the dead here in Khura'in. The high priest's death hit you hard, so you've been grieving here alone, haven't you? Well? Datz: Hee-HO! 1 LOCK BROKEN Datz: Those flowers don't mean anything. It's just a Khura'inese way o' saying goodbye. Phoenix: Why hide the fact that you're mourning his death? Datz: You're reading into this too much. I told ya, I'm done with the rebellion! I haven't even heard from Dhurke or the rest of 'em for a few days. And tomorrow, I'm planning to kiss this kingdom goodbye! Phoenix: No, I know you've been in contact with the other rebels lately! Datz: And how exactly do you plan on proving that?! Phoenix: This piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels! Present Brand New Flag Phoenix: Leads to: \"I found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: ............ Phoenix: Cat got your tongue? Datz: No, it's just, I was shocked at how off-target ya are. Wait, you're not stalling for time or something, are ya? Phoenix: N-No, I'd never do that. (I hope he doesn't think I'm in cahoots with the police or something...) Datz: I keep trying to tell ya -- I got nothing to do with the rebels anymore. Phoenix: (This food was brought here for Mr. Are'bal after he escaped from prison. So he must've gotten in contact with the other rebels somehow.) No, I know you're still involved with them! Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels!\" Phoenix: I found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion. You wrote a message on it, and left it behind for your fellow rebels, didn't you? Datz: Gulp! Phoenix: They brought this food for you at your request. Datz: Hoo-HA HA! Phoenix: So you're lying about leaving the rebels. You're still involved with Dhurke and the rest of them, aren't you? Datz: Naaaaaaaargh! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Are you ready to tell me the truth now? Datz: Oh, you're good, Mr. Lawyer Man! I admit it! I requested the grub. But I was just taking advantage of 'em, that's all! Phoenix: What do you mean? Datz: With my face plastered all over the place, I couldn't stay out in the open anymore. So, I just took advantage of my former comrades for some grub and a place to hide. I was gonna kiss this kingdom goodbye tomorrow! Phoenix: I'm not buying it. You're obviously lying. I can tell just by looking at you. The white-hot flames of revolution definitely still burn on inside of you! Datz: What?! That's ridiculous. Those flames burned out a long time ago! Phoenix: This proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you! Present Dhurke's Law Book Phoenix: Leads to: \"Dhurke's law book? I'm no lawyer, so what's that got to do with me?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: Ah! Phoenix: I'm right, aren't I?! That's why you're so shocked! Datz: Yeesh, I almost forgot about dessert! Phoenix: (I guess that wasn't it.) Datz: Would you give up already? The flames of revolution burned out inside of me a long time ago! Phoenix: (No, I know they still burn on. Because he's wearing something that proves it!) You can't fool me, Mr. Are'bal. Leads back to: \"This proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you!\" Datz: Dhurke's law book? I'm no lawyer, so what's that got to do with me? Phoenix: Look at the mark branded onto the cover. This mark that stands for an unwavering commitment to the revolution. It is Dhurke's way of representing the will of the dragon! Datz: Yeah? So what of it?! Phoenix: You have that same mark on the scarf tied around your left arm. But you wouldn't be wearing that if you were no longer a rebel! Datz: I-I... I forgot to take it off, that's all! Phoenix: No, as a wanted man, that should've been the first thing you took off! The fact that you haven't hidden that mark yet... proves you're still a rebel! Datz: Hoo-HA! 1 LOCK BROKEN Datz: Think whatcha want! But you don't know nothing about me! Phoenix: No, you're wrong. You wear your heart and your beliefs right on your sleeve -- just like me. And this is what I believe in. Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Leads to: \"...............\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: That's what you believe in? Phoenix: Sure! And I never waver from it! Datz: That's the lamest belief I ever heard of! Haaaaaar har har har har! Phoenix: (I didn't think it was THAT funny...) Datz: I was right, you don't know a thing about me! Phoenix: Actually, I know you wear your beliefs right on your sleeve -- just like me. Leads back to: \"And this is what I believe in.\" Datz: ............... Phoenix: When a person's back is against a wall, they always fall back on what they believe in. Just as I always have my badge, you always have the will of the dragon with you. Datz: And would you risk your life for your beliefs? Phoenix: ...No, I wouldn't. Datz: No? Phoenix: No, because I wouldn't be much use to my clients dead. Now, admit it! You've never once thought about leaving the Defiant Dragons, have you! Datz: .........That look in your eyes. It's just like Dhurke's. ...Looks like you've got the will of the dragon inside o' ya, too. 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Mr. Are'bal's plan (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Datz: I had planned to take ya out if ya turned out to be on the side of the royals... But I think I can trust ya. Phoenix: (I can't believe I was that close to getting shanked here...) Datz: It's like ya said. I've no intention of leaving Dhurke's group. Phoenix: In other words, you were testing me. Datz: You're a foreigner, and a lawyer who's been charged with abetting a criminal to boot. And I've seen a fair share of lawyers get pardoned... ...after weeping at the feet of the queen. Phoenix: Well, I'm going to keep fighting till the end. Datz: Yeah, I can see that now. Sorry I ever doubted ya. Phoenix: So, what are you doing here, anyway? Datz: I came to get the secret hideout key from a helper. Phoenix: A secret hideout? Datz: Yep. I was supposed to get my next order from Dhurke there. But the town's swarming with cops thanks to that murder. Nothing I can do about that. Phoenix: What about the order Dhurke was supposed to give you? Datz: Gonna have to abort that mission. Now I'm just lying low, waiting for a chance to make contact with Dhurke again. .........Hey, why the long face? Phoenix: I thought you'd be able to tell me something about the high priest's murder. Datz: Sorry to disappoint ya... Oh, I know. Lemme make it up to ya with this. Phoenix: ...What is it? Datz: This orb is actually a key. It opens the door to one of our secret hideouts. I can't say any more than that. Anyway, I hope it helps. Phoenix: This orb... is a key? Datz: Yep! Plus the hideout's in a totally unexpected location! And being that it's super secret, we couldn't have just any ordinary key! Phoenix: I see... Golden Orb added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Maybe this will help me unravel the truth behind this case. Thanks! Datz: Don't mention it! Besides, you're a fellow brother in arms, fighting the powers that be! If it'll help ya, feel free to pick my brain a bit more. Lady Kee'ra (appears after \"Mr. Are'bal's plan\") Datz: Everyone's been talking about the return of Lady Kee'ra lately. Phoenix: Well, my friend Maya's suspected of being the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra. You wouldn't happen to know who she really is though, would you?! Datz: Beats me. But whoever she is, she bushwhacked me and hauled me off to jail! Even worse, on top o' attacking us and delivering us to the cops... ...she's been watching us like a hawk and framing us for different crimes! Phoenix: Watching you like a hawk? Framing you for crimes? Why would anyone go to all that trouble? Datz: Our kingdom likes to pretend that its people are free to think what they want. Because of that, the authorities can't arrest ya just for sympathizing with the rebellion. So they resort to framing people for things they didn't do. Phoenix: Then that Lady Kee'ra figure is... Datz: Yep, she's just some lickspittle working for the Ga'ran regime. Phoenix: Wow... Inga: Heh, even without the DC Act, Dhurke and his insurgent scum buddies' days are numbered. Phoenix: Wh-What's that supposed to mean?! Inga: Let's just say... I got a little trick up my sleeve. So I'd watch it if I were you. 'Cause you got a defiant attitude -- like one o' them dragon dupes. Phoenix: (So he was talking about Lady Kee'ra, then?) Datz: Advanced combat skills, detailed surveillance, and clever set ups... She's no amateur if ya ask me. Phoenix: So, you're saying the monarchy is using Lady Kee'ra to secretly take out the rebels? Datz: Exactly! The Ga'ran regime is using her to control the people, even down to what we think! Phoenix: Why don't the people protest if the monarchy is doing things like that? Datz: Unfortunately, we don't have any conclusive evidence. And without that, we can't prove anything. Phoenix: Arngh! I know the feeling... If I bring this up in court, they'd probably dismiss it out of hand. (I'll have to unmask Lady Kee'ra if I want to get anywhere.) Goal of the revolution (appears after \"Lady Kee'ra\") Leads to: \"Our goal? To get rid o' that evil, no-good Defense Culpability Act!\" Present Attorney's Badge Datz: I've seen the will of the dragon within ya! You're gonna make a fine rebel! Phoenix: What?! Datz: What's wrong, my friend! You've gotta rise up with me! Har har har har har! Phoenix: Um... I don't recall joining the rebellion, though... Tahrust's Autopsy Report, Inner Sanctum Photo, Nahmanda Flower, or Family Photo Datz: The high priest left Lady Inmee all alone when he died. Even worse, they say she's expecting a baby. Phoenix: It's always hardest for the family members left behind. Datz: I know exactly what you mean. Blast it! If only I could remember what happened after I escaped from prison. Phoenix: (It seems Mr. Are'bal feels responsible for the high priest's death.) Dhurke's Law Book Datz: The dragon emblem branded into that book is a sign of defiance against the Ga'ran regime. That evil law's led to the deaths of many of our brothers in arms. Phoenix: You mean the Defense Culpability Act? Datz: Yep. But we're not gonna stand for it much longer! That's the main reason we have to see this revolution through! Phoenix: (I've never seen him so serious before.) Golden Orb Datz: That orb's the key to the secret hideout. Phoenix: So, where exactly is this hideout, anyway? Datz: Umm............ Phoenix: Don't tell me you forgot when you bumped your head? Datz: .........Har har har har har! Phoenix: (Looks like I'll have to find it myself.) Anything else Datz: Hmm... This is that whatchamacallit, ain't it. Phoenix: What is? Datz: You know, that whatchamacallit. Um... What were we talking about again? Phoenix: It's all right. You don't have to force yourself if you've got nothing to say... Datz: Our goal? To get rid o' that evil, no-good Defense Culpability Act! Phoenix: I can tell just by looking at Dhurke's law book. Datz: The DC Act has turned this kingdom into a corrupt cesspool... ...where false charges are overlooked, and prosecutors are the only ones heard in court. It's been twenty-three years since it was first enacted. Phoenix: What happened twenty-three years ago to make them pass such a terrible law? Datz: The assassination of Queen Amara... That's where it all began. Ahlbi: It happened before I was even born, but... ...Queen Amara -- the previous queen -- was assassinated. And it was the rebel leader Dhurke who did it. Phoenix: Dhurke assassinated the former queen, didn't he? Datz: That's the official line, but... Phoenix: The official line? Datz: Those charges were completely trumped up! Dhurke was framed, I'm telling ya! Phoenix: H-He was?! Datz: Plus, Dhurke was a lawyer. Once the people thought a lawyer had killed the queen, they turned against all lawyers. And that's how the DC Act was first passed. Phoenix: So, that's why there aren't any lawyers left in Khura'in. Datz: Even worse, it changed the significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance. Phoenix: (The significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance?) They were holding S\u00e9ances in court, even before the DC Act? Datz: You bet they were! Lawyers and prosecutors used to hotly contest the Insights that came outta S\u00e9ances. Phoenix: You mean like what I've been doing? Datz: Right! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence. Phoenix: Right... I see what you mean about the significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance changing. Datz: Yep! The Insights became the only truth, and arguing against them was banned! Rayfa: As royal priestess, it is my duty to reveal the truth through the Divination S\u00e9ance. This time, I will prove that the insights I glean thereof are the very truth itself. Prepare yourself, for this shall be your last trial... and your last rites. Tomorrow shall end with you under the headsman's axe! Phoenix: (From what I've seen, Rayfa would agree with that.) Datz: This kingdom's a shadow of its former self. It's become a dictatorship where the royals use the fear of trumped-up charges to rule! Phoenix: And that's what Dhurke's been rebelling against? Datz: Yep. All we want is to live in a kingdom with a fair and impartial legal system. And there's only one way to make that come true: Overthrow the current regime! Phoenix: (So, that's the truth behind the rebels.) Datz: ...Well, PW, my friend, it's about time for me to get going. After all, I AM the fangs of the Defiant Dragons. Datz Are'bal! Phoenix: You're not going to do that \"alley-oop\" thing again, are you? Datz: I was just getting to that! See ya when I see ya! Alley-oop! Phoenix: (Why does he have to jump like that before running off?) ...Well, I guess we're friends now. But enough about that. I've already spent way too much time here! Tehm'pul Temple, Plaza of Devotion, Inner Sanctum, Detention Center, or High Priest's House (before examining manhole, then presenting Brand New Flag in Khura'in - Bazaar) Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: That patch on the accused's bag... It is the Steel Samurai? Phoenix: Yes. It's a huge hit back in my country. Rayfa: I see... It has a rather fine design, I must say. However, it pales beside the Plumed Punisher, of course. Phoenix: Of course... (They all look the same to me, to be honest...) What to do Rayfa: How dare you leave me behind like that! Phoenix: S-Sorry... (It sure was a lot easier without her, though.) Rayfa: Do that again and I will levy a penalty on you! Phoenix: A penalty? Like what...? Rayfa: Like... Oh, I know! You must clean my room. Phoenix: Hey, that's not so bad. Rayfa: ...All thirty of them. Phoenix: Forgive me for leaving you behind, Your Benevolence! May 11Khura'in - Bazaar Phoenix: Whew... I finally got out of there! Ahlbi: Mr. Wright! I'm so glad you're okay! I was so worried about you! Shah'do: *whine* Phoenix: Shah'do... What happened to him, anyway? Ahlbi: He came out of the manhole about five minutes after you went in. Sorry he wasn't much help! Shah'do: *whine* Rayfa: ...Well? Did you find anything of worth? Phoenix: Oh, uh... I tripped and fell down there. I must've been out cold for a while. (I better keep things to myself for now.) Rayfa: I figured as much. Phoenix: (I have to find that secret hideout Mr. Are'bal was talking about. I should probably start with places that have something to do with the high priest.) Examine Manhole Rayfa: What is it, Barbed Head? Is the sewer calling to you once more? Phoenix: Not exactly... (I probably shouldn't tell her about Mr. Are'bal...) Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: Barbed Head... I detect a foul odor emanating from you. Phoenix: Well, I did walk through the sewers, so... Rayfa: Stay back! Keep your stink to yourself! Phoenix: I'd be glad to leave you alone if you'd like. Rayfa: Who said you could walk away from me, you muttonhead! Phoenix: Fine, I'll stick to you like glue. Rayfa: No, that is too close! Phoenix: (I just can't win with her.) What to do Rayfa: Even after investigating the sewers, you have nothing. Phoenix: Well, I'm not ready to give up yet! (Besides, I wouldn't say I have nothing.) There's nowhere I wouldn't go if it would help Maya! Rayfa: So, what will it be next? Will you dive into a septic tank? Phoenix: Uuh... I-If it would help Maya, I wouldn't rule it out! Rayfa: S-Stay back! Phoenix: I thought it was just a hypothetical! Present Golden Orb Rayfa: That orb has a mesmerizing core. I must take a closer look at it. Phoenix: (Mr. Are'bal entrusted me with this, so maybe I shouldn't let even Princess Rayfa handle it.) Y-Your Benevolence? Wouldn't you be defiled by touching an object that has been in the hands of a lawyer? Rayfa: I suppose so. Phoenix: ...You do know that there are no such things as lawyer cooties, right? May 11Inner Sanctum Rayfa: Barbed Head. You already searched here, did you not? Phoenix: Oh, umm... I just thought I'd look around again. You know, in case I missed something? (I probably shouldn't tell her I'm looking for the secret rebel hideout.) We have a saying back home: \"Leave no stone unturned.\" Rayfa: Hmm? ...Oh, yes. You cannot stump me. I know that one. Phoenix: (Actually, \"I don't have a clue\" is written all over your face...) Examine Prayer flags Phoenix: I can't believe Mr. Are'bal used this as a parachute. Rayfa: That reckless fool... Then again, he must have a screw loose if he counts himself among those vile rebels. Phoenix: (I wouldn't exactly call him crazy... but he's certainly one-of-a-kind.) Left side of warbaa'd statue Phoenix: It's a statue of a bird... Guess I'll take a closer look at it. (Changed from [It's a statue of a bird... I should take a closer look later.] in the original release) Statue's missing eye Leads to: \"Hey, this eye is missing.\" Phoenix: Hey, this eye is missing. Rayfa: What are you doing? You must not touch that for no reason! Phoenix: S-Sorry! But that shape... Hmm, I wonder... Present Golden Orb Phoenix: Leads to: \"I knew it!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This might fit in that cavity. Rayfa: Pohlkunka! Wh-What are you doing?! You... chowderhead! Remove your hand from there this instant! Phoenix: S-Sorry! I just thought this might fit in there. Rayfa: Are you blind?! They have entirely different shapes! Phoenix: (Yeah, that was a long shot. Still, I can't help feeling I have something that would fit in there.) Rayfa: Do not let me catch you needlessly touching the statue again! Phoenix: A-Alright already, I get it... Leads back to: \"But that shape... Hmm, I wonder...\" Phoenix: I knew it! Rayfa: Wh-Wh-Wha...?! ........................ Phoenix: (She must be at a loss for words. And that doesn't happen too often.) Rayfa: ...What is this place?! E-Explain yourself at once, Barbed Head! Phoenix: (I don't think she's ready for the full story...) I don't really know much myself, but... It seems to be a secret rebel hideout. (If I'm shocked there's a secret door here, I imagine that goes double for Rayfa.) Rayfa: A rebel hideout in the Inner Sanctum?! Somebody will pay for this! Phoenix: W-Well for now, I think I'll have a look around. Rayfa: Wait! You must not enter before the police! Phoenix: Don't worry, I won't disturb anything. (Or at least I'll try not to...) Besides, with you watching over me, it should be fine, right? And, uh, you see... Rayfa: ...Fine. Just please stop pleading your case. I can only stand so much lawyerly drivel. But I will be presenting all information gleaned from your efforts here to the police. Phoenix: Of course. Now, shall we? Rayfa: I will go no further. Phoenix: Oh, right. You're not supposed to come in contact with the taint of Lady Kee'ra's battles. Rayfa: Very good, Barbed Head. I commend you for remembering! Phoenix: O-Oh, well thank you! (Wait, why am I thanking her?) Rayfa: I may not be able to enter, but I will allow no misdeeds on your part. I will be watching you like a warbaa'd from the entrance here! Phoenix: I told you I'm not going to do anything! (I better hurry before she changes her mind!) Examine Revolving door Phoenix: (Who'd have guessed a rebel hideout would be at the back of the Inner Sanctum? Then again, the sanctum's not open to the public. What better place to hide away from prying eyes?) May 11Secret Hideout Rayfa: I believe this to be a sacred space that enshrines the source of the spring water. Phoenix: (That makes sense. The rebels must've converted it into a secret hideout. But what about that warbaa'd revolving door? I wonder if that, too, was originally intended to hide and protect this sacred space.) Rayfa: To think those filthy rebels were scheming their schemes in this most sacred space...! It is a desecration upon Khura'inism itself! The Defiant Dragons shall pay for this! Phoenix: (I suppose it's only natural that she'd be upset. But the investigation must go on!) I think I'll start by taking a picture of the place. (Good thing I brought a camera to snap some souvenir shots.) Rayfa: Stop that! You must not take photos here without permission! Phoenix: (Rayfa's really fired up. She's sticking her head in as far as it will go. I guess she won't be \"tainted\" as long as she doesn't touch anything...?) Rebel Hideout Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Now, to search every nook and cranny... Rayfa: Barbed Head! Just because it is hard for me to see your every move... ...do not use that as an excuse to touch and break things! Phoenix: I heard you the first time! (Sheesh...) Examine Banner Rayfa: How dare those filthy insurgents raise their banner amid such a sacred space! Barbed Head! You must burn it at once! Phoenix: ...Um, didn't you tell me not to touch or damage anything? Rayfa: Hmph, this is an exception! Very well, if you will not do it, then I will! Phoenix: But, Your Benevolence, I thought you're not supposed to come in here. Rayfa: Nngrrrrrrr...! Phoenix: (For once, the strange customs of this kingdom are working in my favor.) Hm? (There's something under the banner. A microphone? What's this doing here? Was someone trying to record something with it?) Smaller stone slab Phoenix: A large stone slab... (It's shaped like a magatama. It looks rather unstable. I bet it'd tip over in an earthquake.) Hm? What's that earthy, grass-like smell? Rayfa: It is the smell of the moss that covers the stone. Phoenix: Oh, so this shaggy green stuff is moss... ...Hm? It looks like some of the moss about halfway up has been disturbed. ...I wonder why that is? (One quick touch can't hurt, right...?) Whoa! (The slab's starting to wobble!) Rayfa: What is happening?! What have you done to the sacred space?! Phoenix: N-N-Nothing! (All I did was nudge it a little... I knew it looked unstable. Probably best not to touch it again.) Water or larger stone slab Phoenix: So, this is the water source that supplies the Inner Sanctum's spring. It flows through the channel built into the floor before heading outside. Rayfa: Lady Kee'ra uses this sacred water to wash the taint of battle from her body. Phoenix: It's also not red like the water in the spring. Chart Phoenix: Looks like an order from Dhurke. Rayfa: What's this?! Let me see that! Phoenix: I thought you're not supposed to touch anything in here. Rayfa: This is an exception! Now hand it over! Let's see here... Hmm... ...O Holy Mother! Phoenix: What? What does it say? Rayfa: It is an order intended for that rebel named Datz. It reads... \"After the rite, infiltrate the palace under the guise of returning Lady Kee'ra's costume... ...and search for clues about that incident from twenty-three years ago. --Dhurke\" Phoenix: Twenty-three years ago? He must mean the assassination of Queen Amara. I wonder what the rebels are up to... (It's intriguing and all, but it doesn't seem related to the case at hand.) Rayfa: This will not do! I must warn my mother at once! Phoenix: No need to do that. This order will never be carried out. Lady Kee'ra's costume is still here, and Abbot Inmee is no longer able to aid the rebels. Rayfa: Hmph, I-I knew that! Chart (subsequent times) Rayfa: Is there anything else you would like me to read, Barbed Head? Phoenix: Oh, um, let's see... Uhh... How about this note? Rayfa: Let me see that. Konuuro, zabaas, bahr'bahr, yak, and roux... Wait, this looks familiar! Phoenix: What is it? Some kind of Khura'inist spell? Rayfa: No, it's a recipe for Khura'inese curry. Phoenix: I guess the rebels enjoy a home-cooked meal, just like everyone else. Plumed Punisher poster Phoenix: There's a Plumed Punisher calendar here. Rayfa: Ah, now I understand. The villains in The Plumed Punisher are based on the insurgents. Watching the show must have roused their ire against Lady Kee'ra! Phoenix: (Umm... I doubt that's it.) Plumed Punisher clock Phoenix: Look! Rayfa: What is it, Barbed Head? Phoenix: It's a Plumed Punisher clock! Rayfa: Why, I believe it's... It is a limited-edition promotional item given to fifty lucky viewers! This rare item plays the Plumed Punisher theme song ever hour! H-Hand it over now, Barbed Head! Phoenix: Ah! (She snatched it away from me! No matter what she says, Rayfa is definitely a huge fan.) Rayfa: Hmm... What a fine item. And this switch... If I'm right... Phoenix: (It's the Plumed Punisher theme song...) Rayfa: Yes, now I see! The insurgents who use this room... ...must be Plumed Punisher fans! Phoenix: ...That may be so, but I don't see how it's relevant to this case. Chain Phoenix: The statue door rotates when you pull this chain. Rayfa: I see...Then you must shut the door and destroy its mechanism! That will deprive the insurgents of access to this place! Phoenix: B-But wouldn't that trap me in here? Rayfa: Not to worry! I would come to visit you once a year. Phoenix: (She's actually serious!) Cart or guns Phoenix: Weapons! And lots of them, too. Rayfa: We are lucky we found them before they could be used. Excellent work, Barbed Head! Phoenix: Oh, uh, thanks... (If the rebellion ever happens, I hope it's bloodless.) Bloodstain Phoenix: What's this? A bloodstain...? I should probably try to figure out what happened in here. Hmm... Rayfa: Do not tamper with any evidence before the police arrive! Phoenix: ...The police? Hey, that reminds me. Ema gave me something just for times like these. Ema: I thought it might help your investigation. Here, it's all yours! I wanted to bring you a bunch of other forensic tools... ...but they were confiscated at the airport. Phoenix: (Luminol testing fluid... This actually might come in handy.) Phoenix: (Luminol testing fluid glows in reaction to even the tiniest traces of blood. So it can even detect areas where blood has been wiped up. It might help us figure out what happened in here. Okay, time for science to do its thing! First, let me put these red-tinted glasses on to see the luminol's glow... ...then I just press [A / Space] wherever I want to spray some of the luminol. (Changed from [...then I just touch wherever I want to spray some of the luminol.] in the original release) Areas where there was blood will react by turning blue.) Spray area near where waterway diverges Leads to: Leads to: \"Th-This is a huge bloodstain! Something big must've happened here!\" Phoenix: Th-This is a huge bloodstain! Something big must've happened here! Rayfa: Perhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue. Phoenix: ...There was definitely a lot of blood here. But it's impossible to say much else at this point. I'll just take a picture for now. Oh, right. Luminol reactions don't show up in photos. I'll just have to take some notes. That should do it! (...I didn't notice before, but the bloodstain looks like it was smeared away in one place. Is it because the warbaa'd revolving door passed over it?) Rebel Hideout Photo updated in the Court Record. Bloodstain (subsequent times) Phoenix: That bloodstain on the floor... The luminol showed that it was even bigger than I expected. Something definitely happened here, and it wasn't good. Rayfa: How can you be so sure? Perhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue. Phoenix: True... But there's not much else we can say at this point. After examining banner, smaller stone slab, chart, Plumed Punisher clock, and bloodstain: Phoenix: ...Well, I think that covers about everything here. Ema: Mr. Wright! You shouldn't have come in here before the police! Phoenix: Sorry, but I was in a hurry. I didn't do anything I wasn't supposed to. Her Benevolence can attest to that. Rayfa: It is your fault for being so slow. I expect the police to work faster and more efficiently! Ema: Sorry... Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Have you not already seen enough? Phoenix: I guess it's about time I got back to the temple and go over everything I've learned. May 11Tehm'pul Temple Ahlbi: Welcome back, Mr. Wright! How'd it go? Phoenix: Unfortunately, I didn't find anything conclusive. Ahlbi: N-No way! Rayfa: ...I do not understand, Barbed Head. Phoenix: What don't you understand? Rayfa: Why you did not commit any misdeeds during your investigation. After all, lawyers ply their trade primarily through illicit means and methods. Phoenix: What?! Who told you that? Rayfa: My mother. Are you saying she was wrong? ...No, that cannot be! You must have committed some sort of misdeed right under my nose. Phoenix: (If that were so, she wasted her whole day following me around.) Rayfa: Hm? What is it? ........................ Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has need of me. Phoenix: What's going on? Rayfa: I must go perform a Divination S\u00e9ance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins. Phoenix: I see... Rayfa: .........The third time will be the charm. My insights will finally bring you to your knees tomorrow! And I will teach that neophyte practitioner a lesson! Phoenix: (Looks like the royal priestess is back with a vengeance. She's made a full recovery from when we started the investigation earlier today.) I look forward to seeing you in court, Your Benevolence! Rayfa: Hmph. Your overconfidence will be your downfall. You will not look so confident when I am finished with you tomorrow! Phoenix: Actually... I'm not really looking forward to seeing her tomorrow. Especially without any solid evidence. Ahlbi: Why don't we go over everything you know so far? Phoenix: All right. Hmm, let's see here... Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed during the rite with Lady Kee'ra's dagger. And Maya's fingerprints were found on it. Ahlbi: That doesn't sound very good! Phoenix: I know... It's the very definition of being up a creek without a paddle. The day before his murder, Zeh'lot enjoyed a meal with the high priest, his wife, and Maya. I also learned about spirit channeling here in Khura'in. Ahlbi: None of that sounds very helpful. Phoenix: Oh, but I did hear something interesting. That the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra might be working for the justice minister. Ahlbi: What?! Really?! Our kingdom is supposed to be ruled through faith and laws. We can't allow the people to be controlled by fear and violence! Phoenix: Ahlbi, that sounds like something a rebel might say. Ahlbi: I-It does? But if that Lady Kee'ra really is one of Minister Inga's subordinates... ...that would exonerate Miss Maya! Phoenix: Unfortunately, I have no way of proving it in court. Ahlbi: ...Oh, that's too bad. Phoenix: Oh, I almost forgot about the secret rebel hideout we found at the Inner Sanctum. There was a bloodstain inside. But I don't know if or how it's connected to this case, though. Ahlbi: Wow! A secret room at the Inner Sanctum?! That would be a huge hit with tourists! Phoenix: (This kid really is an entrepreneur at heart.) Ahlbi: ...Er, what I mean is that hideout could be important to your case. Phoenix: Maybe, but it's still too early to tell. Argh... Looks like I'm heading into court without any useful evidence. Ahlbi: We'll just have to pray something appears during tomorrow's trial... Phoenix: Princess Rayfa's Divination S\u00e9ance might be my only hope. There could be some new information in it that might help. Ahlbi: Th-The Divination S\u00e9ance?! But I thought it always works against the accused! Phoenix: ...Not always. Datz: Right! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence. Ahlbi: Really?! I never heard anyone say that before. It's hard to figure you out sometimes, sir. Phoenix: (Divination S\u00e9ances worked both ways before the Defense Culpability Act. It's only now that the people of Khura'in find it strange.) Ahlbi: Um, Mr. Wright? I just wanted to say... good luck tomorrow! Phoenix: Thanks. I can't afford to lose this next one. (I've collected all sorts of information, but I haven't even started connecting the dots. If I could do that, I might have a shot at pulling off a win. Rayfa's Insights will be the deciding factor. It's a huge gamble, but it's all I've got!) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Phoenix: I've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I'm pretty sure I know what I need to, but... ...maybe I should go over it all again.)\nThe Rite of Turnabout Image Gallery TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4May 12, 9:34 AMHigh Court of Khura'in - Accused LobbyMaya: .........Phoenix: (Maya looks exhausted, but I can't blame her.)Maya: Nick, I was thinking about it all day yesterday... I never properly asked you to defend me, did I?Phoenix: It doesn't matter. I'm on this case till the bitter end.Maya: I know. That's why... I wanted to officially ask you for your help.Phoenix: You got it, Maya! Let's do this. We gotta wrap this up and get back home so you can make your dream show come true. \"The Steel Samurai vs. The Plumed Punisher,\" right?Maya: You bet!Rayfa: You look as if you did not sleep last night, Barbed Head. It is written all over your face. How can you expect to put up a respectable defense like that?Phoenix: I-I'm all fired up, and raring to go! (I guess Maya's not the only one looking exhausted.)Rayfa: ...........................Phoenix: (Hm? Rayfa doesn't seem in the best spirits herself.)Rayfa: Hmph. Go ahead, feign confidence now while you are still able. For I will see to it that your last rites are read to you this day!Phoenix: (Heh, guess it was just my imagination...)Maya: Ready, Nick?Phoenix: Okay, Maya, let's head on in!May 12High Court of Khura'inDay 2Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge: Now then, if everyone is ready...Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Magistry.Nahyuta: The prosecution is ready. Let us begin without further delay.Judge: Oh, no prayers this time, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta: I already offered my prayers for the latest victim during my visit to the crime scene. Being that the accused has already been found guilty of the first murder... ...let us hasten this trial, so we may put this dead lawyer walking out of his misery.Judge: I could not agree more. In yesterday's trial, the accused was already found guilty of murdering the high priest. And today she will be tried for the murder of his disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot. Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your opening statement, if you would.Nahyuta: ...Certainly. The accused has now slain two of the most devout clergymen in Khura'inism. Even the lowest level of Hell -- the Hell of Tickling -- would not be punishment enough.Judge: *gulp* Th-Then... what t-terrible fate awaits her?Nahyuta: Bahlgilpo'kon Hell -- a realm of eternal agony. There she will suffer the endless punishment of ja'gar by the galuun of Puhlmo'ten. Furthermore, Guhljaama--Judge: E-Enough, enough! My blood runs cold at the mere thought that such a terrible place exists.Phoenix: (I was going to ask for a translation, but on second thought, ignorance is bliss.)Judge: N-Now then, please continue, minus the part about the terrible hell awaiting the accused.Nahyuta: As you wish... The victim of this heinous crime was the high priest's disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot. He had been training under the high priest while living at the priest's home.Judge: I had met him a number of times, and he seemed like an earnest young man. How tragic that he met such a terrible end.Nahyuta: The murder occurred at the Plaza of Devotion, during the Purification Rite. It was a bold crime carried out while the plaza was full of the faithful deep in prayer. The Warbaa'd Dagger was found impaled in the victim's upper back. The stabbing caused a spinal cord injury that killed him instantly.Judge: Ah, the Warbaa'd Dagger. Lady Kee'ra's weapon of choice.Nahyuta: We have already established that the accused's prints were on the weapon. Incredibly damning evidence in itself.Maya: N-No... I didn't do it!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Hold your tongue. Now, being that the accused, Maya Fey, is a serial killer... ...the prosecution believes that the death penalty is the only possible sentence.Judge: Would the defense care to respond?Phoenix: The accused is innocent, and nothing can convince me otherwise! After all, the crime scene was packed with worshippers. How could my client possibly have committed this murder without a single witness?Nahyuta: The accused's fingerprints on the murder weapon alone is enough to render a verdict. As such, I see no need to debate this any further.Phoenix: B-But...!Judge: Well, once Her Benevolence conducts her S\u00e9ance, it will be clear for all to see.Nahyuta: ............... Your Magistry, might I have a word?Judge: Hm? Is something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta: It is about the Divination S\u00e9ance...Rayfa:Judge: Y-Your Benevolence!Rayfa: Stop right there, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.Nahyuta: ...As you wish. Forgive me for overstepping my bounds.Phoenix: (What was that all about?)Rayfa: Barbed Head, have you made peace with your fate? For this time, the Divination S\u00e9ance will bring you to your knees!Phoenix: I'm ready. And I accept your challenge. (The only problem is, I have no weapons at my disposal. Our only hope now is what we can glean from the S\u00e9ance vision and Rayfa's Insights.)Judge: Very well. The Divination S\u00e9ance if you please, Your Benevolence.Rayfa: Yes, let us begin. ...Nayna! O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination S\u00e9ance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!Rayfa: ............Phoenix: ............Judge: ............Phoenix:  (I don't get it. Why wasn't there anything to see?)Judge: Y-Your Benevolence! What in the world...?Rayfa: Urgh... I was unable to evoke any sort of response. I called out the spirit's name many times... but to no avail!Nahyuta: Just as I thought...Phoenix: (Wait, what does he know that we don't?)Nahyuta: I had sought to confirm the contents of today's Divination S\u00e9ance. After all, it is customary for the prosecutor to verify it beforehand.Phoenix: (Come to think of it...)Rayfa: I must go perform a Divination S\u00e9ance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins.Nahyuta: And that is why I sought to stop Her Benevolence from performing it here. However, she insisted that it be done. She wished to try one more time here in the Hall of Justice.Judge: It would appear Her Benevolence is tired from her manifold duties.Rayfa: I am not anything of the sort! The victim's spirit will not answer my call, but I know not why! It is my sacred duty to convey the truth through the Divination S\u00e9ance!Phoenix: (Rayfa...)Judge: What are we to do without a Divination S\u00e9ance?Nahyuta: I suppose I shall have to deliver the last rites without them. The prosecution has already taken that into account when preparing for today. I am fully capable of proving the accused's guilt, with or without a Divination S\u00e9ance.Judge: Ha ha ha ha ha! You never fail to impress, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.Phoenix: (This is bad... The Divination S\u00e9ance was my one and only hope.) Your Magistry, Her Benevolence said she isn't tired! So, shouldn't we try to find out why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed?Rayfa: !Judge: How curious, Mr. Wright. Why have you suddenly taken such a keen interest in the Divination S\u00e9ance?Rayfa: Yes, explain yourself! The Divination S\u00e9ance is for shedding light on an accused's crimes! It is the Holy Mother's hammer of wrath, that is ever poised to pound you into your grave! You should fear it, not plead for it!Phoenix: ...I believe in my client. Plus, yesterday, somebody told me something that changed my mind: The Divination S\u00e9ance was once thought of as just another piece of evidence. If we were to correctly interpret the visions through careful analysis... ...then they would lead us to the truth behind what really happened. And the truth will show that my client, Maya Fey, is innocent.Maya: The truth is, you don't have anything else to fall back on, huh, Nick?Phoenix: ...Maya, please, you're not helping.Rayfa: How dare you?! The voice of a mitamah is to be feared, not utilized by vile lawyers such as you!Nahyuta: S\u00e9ances exact a heavy toll upon the royal priestess. It would be best not to burden her any further. Or does the defense feel that it can pose no counterarguments without the S\u00e9ance?Phoenix: N-No, of course not! (He saw right through me! I'll have to find a way to make the Divination S\u00e9ance happen, or we're toast.)Judge: Well, since the Divination S\u00e9ance is not possible at this time, I see no other choice. Let us proceed with the trial without the S\u00e9ance, as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi suggested.Nahyuta: Thank you, Your Magistry.Rayfa: Why you...! I will not forget this, Barbed Head! This will NOT be the last you see of me!Nahyuta: Now then, I will now proceed by providing an outline of the case at hand.Judge: Very well. If the lead detective would please come to the stand, we may begin.Ema: ........................ ...Sorry, Mr. Wright.Nahyuta: Detective Skye... I understand how you would wish to save the accused and the defense. They are your friends, after all. But you must let them go... and move on.Ema: B-But...!Nahyuta: There is only one way to save them now: By giving their souls the chance to burn away the taint of their sins in the infernal flames.Ema: Ooh... I... I... I can't do this!Judge: Ah! No eating in the sacred Hall of Justice!Maya: Ms. Skye!Ema: Y-Yes?!Maya: Don't worry about me and Nick. You just do your job. I'm sure Nick will figure something out... eventually!Ema: ............... Right. Thanks, Ms. Fey.Nahyuta: How very brave for a criminal with a tainted soul. Very well, Detective Skye. Please proceed.Ema: Okay, I can do this... Let me start with an overview of this case.Witness Testimony-- Overview of the Second Murder --Ema: The latest victim was Puhray Zeh'lot. He had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years. The high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body. He may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.Judge: I see... Well, that certainly makes sense. Would the defense care to respond?Phoenix: (I didn't spot any inconsistencies in her testimony so far. And I don't have any evidence in my arsenal. What am I going to do now?)Maya: Hmm...Phoenix: What is it, Maya?Maya: I was just wondering about how much the police actually looked into Acolyte Zeh'lot. Because it just might prove to be the key as to why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed.Phoenix: What are you getting at?Maya: Umm, well... It's just a hunch.Phoenix: (Wait a second. During my investigation... ...Rayfa told me about how the Divination S\u00e9ance works. If I could figure out why it failed... ...maybe she could try it again. Okay! Time to press for some more information!)Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- Overview of the Second Murder --Ema: The latest victim was Puhray Zeh'lot.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of person was Acolyte Zeh'lot? Ema: According to the neighbors and others who knew him... ...he was a deeply devout youth. Nahyuta: I, too, have heard his name mentioned as one who was a fervent practitioner. I suppose you might say he was the high priest's star disciple. Ema: Furthermore...Ema: He had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Two years? Are you sure about that? Ema: We took statements from his neighbors and his fellow monks. They all corroborate our initial findings. Phoenix: What about you, Maya? Maya: ...Well, when I first came here... ...I saw Zeh'lot praying under the high priest's instruction. Phoenix: I see... So the results of the police investigation seem to check out...Ema: The high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was Mrs. Inmee's positive ID the only way you verified the identity of the victim? Ema: Huh? ...Well, no! We also checked the ID card he carried and the data in his family registry. But... Phoenix: But what? Ema: His personal information didn't match any of the public records we cross-referenced. Phoenix: Maybe that's why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed. Ema: I-I'm not sure what you mean, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Here's what I'm thinking... His address was wrong Phoenix: The victim's address was wrong! Ema: Um... Mr. Wright? Even if it was wrong, how would that affect the Divination S\u00e9ance? Phoenix: Oh, uhh... You're right. It wouldn't. (What was it that a Divination S\u00e9ance required, again? Oh, right! Then there is only one possible answer!) Ema: It looks like the fact that his personal info wasn't in the public records isn't important. Phoenix: No, Ema, it is important. Leads to: \"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason...\" Puhray Zeh'lot is a fake name Leads to: \"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason...\" Phoenix: The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason... In other words, he was using a fake name! The royal priestess uses a deceased's face and true name to summon their spirit. Rayfa: Why, yes, that is indeed true. Nahyuta: If he was using a forged ID and there is no mention of him in our public records... ...then he was likely an illegal immigrant. They are not uncommon here in Khura'in. Phoenix: An illegal immigrant? (Come to think of it, Rayfa mentioned something about immigrants yesterday.) Ema: But if that's the case, we have no way of knowing who he really is. We'll have to proceed without holding a Divination S\u00e9ance this time. Phoenix: Urk! Judge: I had always thought that Acolyte Zeh'lot was Khura'inese. Oh, how the high priest must be lamenting his disciple's deception in the Twilight Realm. Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think? Should we add this to the testimony? Add it to the testimony Phoenix: This is an important fact. Please add it to the testimony. Judge: Hmm... It would seem to be a fact most inconvenient for the defense. But, if you insist. Detective Skye, please add what you just said to your testimony. Ema: Yes, Your Magistry. Adds statement \"He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.\" Don't add it to the testimony Phoenix: No, Your Magistry. There's no need to add it to her testimony. Judge: Very well, then. Please continue if you would, Detective Skye. Ema: Yes, Your Magistry. We still don't know the victim's true identity, but... Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: But the victim was using a fake name, so... ...he may very well have been in Khura'in illegally. Ema: Y-Yes, that's very likely the case. Phoenix: (Now that I have an opening, what next? It's still not going to help me learn Zeh'lot's true identity. Was he really an illegal alien?)Ema: He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Isn't there some way to track down his real name? Ema: No, not if he was an illegal immigrant. Phoenix: Have you actually confirmed that he was in Khura'in illegally? Ema: Well, we don't have any conclusive evidence. But there's also no evidence of him being a citizen of Khura'in, either. Phoenix: Hoh boy... Now what do we do... Maya: What if there was a clue in the evidence you gathered? Phoenix: That's probably our only hope at this point. (If he really was an illegal immigrant, our proverbial goose is probably cooked.)Present Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Sorry, Detective Skye...\"Ema: He may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya isn't that Lady Kee'ra who's been going around capturing rebels! Ema: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright, but...  Nahyuta: Nahyuta: That verdict was already handed down in the previous trial. It is no longer a point of dispute, and I will not allow you to make it so. Phoenix: But...! Nahyuta: No \"ifs,\" \"ands,\" and most of all, no \"buts.\" The accused was posing as Lady Kee'ra. And she killed Acolyte Zeh'lot because she mistakenly believed him to be a rebel. Maya: Th-That's not true! Ema: I'm sorry... The verdict has already been read in that case. I have to assume that it's fact now. Phoenix: Arngh!Before adding statement Phoenix: Maya, you mentioned that Ema's testimony might hold a clue as to why the S\u00e9ance failed. Maya: I did, but it's really just a hunch. Phoenix: (That might mean there was a mistake made during the investigation. It would have to be information that would impact the S\u00e9ance. Hmm, what could it be...?)After adding statement Phoenix: (Now I know why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed, but...) Maya: Umm, nothing's really changed. Phoenix: Yeah, which means we're in big trouble. Maya: If he really was an illegal immigrant, it's going to be real hard to find out his real name... Phoenix: (I guess our only choice is to give up on the whole Divination S\u00e9ance thing. If only there was some way to find out the victim's real name...)-- I Have an Alibi --Tahrust: I have an ironclad alibi for the time during which the murder took place.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You used the word alibi as if it were second nature. Tahrust: Hrrrmmm... Are you, perhaps, mocking me? Or is it, perhaps, the Kingdom of Khura'in itself you wish to ridicule? Gallery: C'mon! Everyone and their grandma knows what alibi means!We're not a bunch of country bumpkins here! We have plenty of courtroom dramas on TV! Judge: Peace, peace! Peace, I say! Mr. Wright, would you care to clarify your last statement? Phoenix: P-Please! Don't take it the wrong way! It's just, alibi is a rather technical term for a priest to use so naturally. Tahrust: I assure you, I know how to use the term. In fact, I had even hoped for a chance to do so one day. I suppose that even I, a high priest, am not immune to such trivial worldly attachments. Phoenix: O-Oh, I see... (Still, he seems unusually calm and composed. It's almost as if he had prepped himself for something like this...)Tahrust: Just past noon on the day before the rite, I was entertaining guests at my home.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Guests...? And you were entertaining them personally? Tahrust: That I was. We gathered around the table for a most enjoyable conversation. Phoenix: (He said his guests could corroborate his alibi. That can't be good for our case.) Phoenix: Are you sure that was the same day as the murder? Maybe you've misremembered. Tahrust: KAAAAAAAH! Do not doubt my mnemonic faculties! I may have died, but my memories up to that point are crystal clear! Phoenix: S-Sorry...  (...He's pretty thin-skinned for a priest. Though, I guess I should've known better than to doubt his memory...) Rayfa: A spirit's memory is cut off at the moment of death. Phoenix: So even a spirit that is brought back after centuries doesn't sense any gap in time... ...between the moment of its death, and the moment it is channeled? Rayfa: Yes, and yet, it clearly recalls all of the memories it had in life. Tahrust: Ahh... There's nothing better than enjoying gingihl cuisine with dear friends. That way, everyone's breath becomes equally malodorous! Phoenix: Right...Tahrust: And I believe my guests can corroborate this.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And who exactly were your guests that day? Don't tell me they were rebels, so they can't be called here to testify... Tahrust: It was none other than His Magistry, along with his family. He couldn't attend the rite due to work, so he stopped by ahead of time. My my, how his daughter has grown. Phoenix: ...Wait a second. Judge: Let me set the record straight right now. I am NOT a rebel. Thank you for that wonderful meal, Abbot Inmee. Lady Inmee's cooking simply cannot be beat! Tahrust: ...So there you have it. Phoenix: When exactly was His Magistry at your home? Tahrust: He was there from 2 PM to 3 PM. Indeed, precisely the time period within which Acolyte Zeh'lot was slain. Judge: Yes, and we had a rousing chat concerning the game of Kachu'demahl. Phoenix: B-But...! Judge: I'll just have that added to the testimony. After all, it was I who visited the high priest's home. Adds statement \"My guests that day were His Magistry and his family. They visited from 2 PM to 3 PM.\"Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: And who exactly were your guests that day? Don't tell me they were rebels, so they can't be called here to testify... Tahrust: It was none other than His Magistry, along with his family. He couldn't attend the rite due to work, so he stopped by ahead of time. My my, how his daughter has grown. Phoenix: ...Wait a second. Judge: Let me set the record straight right now. I am NOT a rebel. Thank you for that wonderful meal, Abbot Inmee. Lady Inmee's cooking simply cannot be beat! Tahrust: ...So there you have it. Phoenix: When exactly was His Magistry at your home? Tahrust: He was there from 2 PM to 3 PM. Indeed, precisely the time period within which Acolyte Zeh'lot was slain. Judge: Yes, and we had a rousing chat concerning the game of Kachu'demahl. Phoenix: B-But...!Tahrust: My guests that day were His Magistry and his family. They visited from 2 PM to 3 PM.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-Your Magistry, are you sure this testimony is completely accurate? Judge: As sure as sure can be! Oh, how wonderful it is to finally have my actions be admissible as evidence in court! Tahrust: His Magistry was at my home during the exact time period of the murder. Come, let us put this behind us. I could not have possibly committed this crime. Phoenix: How can you be so sure? What if the clock or watch you were using was off, or you misread the time? Judge: There was a clock right near the table, and it had the exact same time as my watch. Tahrust: Now do you understand, lawyer?Phoenix: How am I going to attack his alibi? Maya, what do you... Oh, right... She's kind of busy right now.Tahrust: What? Is there something on my face? Hrrrmm?Phoenix: N-No, not at all! (I'll just have to start chipping away at that statement about his alibi.)After pressing all statements:Tahrust: As you can see, my alibi is airtight. Or do you still think I could have killed Acolyte Zeh'lot?Phoenix: Argh...! (His Magistry's a witness?!)Nahyuta: Are you satisfied now? There is not a single discrepancy in Abbot Inmee's alibi.Phoenix: (I-If I give up now, it's all over!) N-Now hold on a second! (Is there something, ANYTHING wrong with the high priest's testimony?)There is Leads to: \"There IS a discrepancy in the high priest's testimony!\"There isn't Phoenix: Wait... Never mind. Nahyuta: I thought as much. After all, there can be no killer other than the accused. Judge: Indeed. And therefore, I see no need to continue these proceedings. Phoenix: (Do I really want to give up now? If I do, Maya will be found guilty. Was there really not a single thing wrong with the high priest's testimony?) Please, Your Magistry, wait. Leads to: \"There IS a discrepancy in the high priest's testimony!\"Phoenix: There IS a discrepancy in the high priest's testimony!Judge: There is? Well then, perhaps you could explain what it might be.Phoenix: This is what was wrong with his testimony.The prayer feast was short Phoenix: The meal was too short to be a Feast of Blessings celebration. Nahyuta: The length of the feast is of no consequence. Besides, Lady Inmee's testimony regarding the feast was the same as her husband's. Or would you suggest Abbot Inmee and his wife are lying? Judge: Hmm. I see no problem as you allege. Phoenix: Oops... I guess I'm wrong then. Judge: It seems there is nothing wrong with Abbot Inmee's testimony. Phoenix: I beg to differ. There IS a problem! A big one! Leads back to: \"This is what was wrong with his testimony.\"He's too friendly with the judge Phoenix: He's way too friendly with you, Your Magistry. Are you two perhaps, more than just friends? Judge: M-M-Mr. Wright! What on earth are you suggesting?! Phoenix: You seem awfully flustered, Your Magistry. That seems kind of suspicious. Tahrust: You are free to think anything you like about our relationship. But it has nothing to do with the case at hand. Judge: I concur! Now, I believe you know what comes next. Phoenix: (Guess I got a little carried away there...) Judge: It seems there is nothing wrong with Abbot Inmee's testimony. Phoenix: I beg to differ. There IS a problem! A big one! Leads back to: \"This is what was wrong with his testimony.\"He knew the time of the crime Leads to: \"After Abbot Inmee was channeled...\"Phoenix: After Abbot Inmee was channeled... ...no one ever stated what time Acolyte Zeh'lot was murdered!Judge: N-Now that you mention it...!Phoenix: Despite that, you claim to have an alibi from 2 PM to 3 PM. That means you knew that Acolyte Zeh'lot was dead... ...when you were still alive!Tahrust: Haaargh!Phoenix: (Wait... I think I saw something just now... No, I must be imagining things.) So, tell me, how did you know what time the crime had been committed?Tahrust: Ummm... About that... Hrrrmmmmmm... HRRRRNH! ...Open your heart! Let the Holy Mother in!Judge: Wh-Why! We've been blessed with the high priest's sacred words of prayer!Tahrust: All who serve Her Holiness must strive to banish worldly desires from their soul! Open your heart! Let the Holy Mother in! Purge your mind of greed and bias!Judge: I feel as if my very soul has been cleansed!Phoenix: You can't fool me! Prayer may banish worldly desires, but it can't make a contradiction disappear!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: How can you be so sure?Phoenix: (What's that supposed to mean?)Nahyuta: This lawyer seems to think little of the power of Khura'inist prayer.Phoenix: Huh?Nahyuta: Abbot Inmee was at home during the crime, but knew of what happened at the hideout. I believe this can be explained thusly... He must have had a way to monitor the hideout from his home.Phoenix: What?!Tahrust: .................. Y-You never cease to amaze, Prosecutor. As he has surmised, there was a listening device installed at the hideout. It enabled me to instantly learn of anything unusual, even when I was not there.Nahyuta: Remember, the rebels had been using this as a top-secret hideout. It would be perfectly natural for them to install such an apparatus.Phoenix: (Wait, come to think of it, when I was searching the rebel hideout...)Phoenix: Hm? (There's something under the banner. A microphone? What's this doing here? Was someone trying to record something with it?)Phoenix: (That was a listening device...?)Tahrust: It starts recording whenever it detects movement. And I heard just such a recording after His Magistry and his family left. If you look in the desk in my study, you will find the tape in question.Judge: All right, then...

    "cot": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is to find which evidence contradicts a testimony in the given scenario. The user provided a bunch of characters, evidence, testimonies, and the story transcript. My task is to determine which piece of evidence directly contradicts a specific testimony.\n\nLooking at the testimonies provided, the fifth one from Tahrust says: \"I would describe the noise as a terrible crash. Poor Zeh'lot... It must have felt so heavy.\" He's referring to the loud noise he heard on the recording, which he believes was Zeh'lot's death caused by a crash.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence, the Rebel Hideout Photo (evidence 26) shows the secret hideout with a luminol reaction near the entrance and two upright stone slabs. The key detail here is the stone slabs. Earlier in the story, Phoenix investigates the hideout and finds a stone slab that's unstable and could cause a crash if moved. However, in the updated photo after Tahrust's testimony, the stone slab is shown upright and in place, meaning the crash (stone falling) would have left it in a different position. But according to Tahrust's testimony, when he checked the hideout after the crime, everything was as usual, implying the stone slab was back in place. But the Rebel Hideout Photo shows the stone slab had been disturbed (luminol reaction indicating blood), which contradicts Tahrust's claim that the hideout appeared normal, meaning the crash should have left evidence of the stone being moved, which the photo shows. However, Tahrust's testimony says he found the hideout as usual, which contradicts the evidence of the displaced stone slab and bloodstain. Wait, maybe the photo's caption says \"It is just as Abbot Inmee saw it after the incident.\" So if the photo shows the stone slabs upright and the area as normal, but the luminol reaction indicates blood was there, which wasn't mentioned by Tahrust. Wait, Tahrust said he found nothing unusual, but the bloodstain (from the luminol) would indicate something happened there. Therefore, the Rebel Hideout Photo (evidence 26) showing the bloodstain contradicts Tahrust's testimony that the hideout appeared normal, meaning he should have noticed the blood or the disturbance. So the contradiction is between the photo showing the bloodstain (from the murder) and Tahrust's claim that everything was as usual when he checked. Therefore, evidence 26 (Rebel Hideout Photo) contradicts testimony 5 (the crash noise and his assertion that the hideout was normal)."

You ain't just judging me solely on my bodacious beard, are ya? Phoenix: Not at all, Mr. Ihmus. It's much more than your sketchy appearance. It's your sketchy testimony.

How could the shadows have been projected that clearly onto the curtain? Ihmus: No wonder people harp on you lawyers! You're always so dang skeptical!

Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You claim to have seen shadowy figures that were projected onto the ritual curtain. But did you really see them, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: 'Course I did!

I guess the moon does shine a bit brighter when you're way up there...) Maya, do you recall how bright the moon was that night? Maya: Umm... I remember there weren't any clouds, and that the moon was definitely out. But I don't remember if it could cast any shadows. Phoenix: Okay, thanks. (We can't deny that the moon was really bright. Which means it's possible that it was bright enough to cause shadows to appear.) Ihmus: Har har har har har! I remember it just like it happened!

His testimony has sketchy written all over it. Maya: Then there must be an inconsistency in there somewhere! Phoenix: ...Yep. (Was he really watching everything from Mt. Poniponi? If so, then I should see how his testimony lines up with the conditions of the rite.) Phoenix: You saw silhouettes projected by the moonlight? Sorry, but that's just not possible. Ihmus: Wh-Whaddaya mean?! How's it not possible that it was totally possible?! That's impossible! Phoenix: (I think I'm going to need a \"logicalese\" translation on that...) Let's take a look at this rites guide, shall we, Mr. Ihmus? The rite is held \"when the moon is directly over the summit of Mt. Poniponi.\" Ihmus: Doot doot doooooot... Phoenix: So if the moon was shining from the west, shadows would've been cast eastward. But Mr. Ihmus was standing to the west of the Inner Sanctum on Mt. Poniponi. Judge: O Holy Mother! Phoenix: That's right. Our witness here couldn't have seen any shadowy figures on that curtain! Ihmus: N-N-No... NO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY-HEE-HEE-HEEEE! Judge: Hmm... Perhaps it was the sacred flames of the lanterns that cast the shadows he saw? Phoenix: I'm afraid not. I inspected them during my investigation, but... ...the flames were too small to cast the crisp, distinct figures Mr. Ihmus claims to have seen. Ihmus: But...! I did see those silhouettes! Really! Maya: But how could he, Nick? Phoenix: Maybe he was someplace where they WERE visible...? (Wait... Don't tell me...!) Your Magistry! If Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows, it brings a brand-new fact to light! Judge: And that would be...? Phoenix: The brand-new fact that comes to light if Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows is... He didn't see the murder Phoenix: He didn't see the murder! Ihmus: But I just told ya I DID see the silhouettes on the curtain! If you think I didn't see the murder, then prove it! Phoenix: I can't actually prove it, but my lawyer's intuition tells me you didn't see it! Judge: Mr. Wright, you shall have to do better than that. Unless you want more of these, anyway. Phoenix: (He's saying he saw the shadows from Mt. Poniponi, which I've shown is impossible. In that case...) Your Magistry. If Mr. Ihmus really did see the shadows, there can be only one explanation. Leads to: \"He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!\" He was somewhere else Leads to: \"He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!\" Phoenix: He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder! Ihmus: D-Doot doot dooooot... Judge: Oh? Then where do you propose the witness was? Phoenix: Someplace where he could have seen the shadow figures, naturally! Maya: Wait! You mean... Phoenix: None of the mountains east of the Inner Sanctum are close enough for a good view. That leaves only one place he could've clearly seen the shadows from. Judge: ...And where might that be? Phoenix: This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder. The Plaza of Devotion Phoenix: He was at the Plaza of Devotion! Nahyuta: Do you truly believe Mr. Ihmus could see the Inner Sanctum from there? Phoenix: He must have really good eyes. Ihmus: Ooh, I do pride myself on my excellent vision! But still, you think I could've seen the Inner Sanctum with a big ol' mountain in the way? Judge: It's not a matter of good eyesight, defense. I must punish you for not seeing that. Phoenix: Argh... Should've seen that coming... (All righty, then...) Judge: You lawyers are a desperate lot, aren't you. Phoenix: Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'll get it right this time! Leads back to: \"This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.\" The high priest's home Phoenix: He was at the high priest's home! Judge: And just how do you propose he saw those curtain shadows from there? Phoenix: Umm, the witness must be clairvoyant. Judge: Clairvoyant?! Is this true, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: Do I look like a psychic nutjob to you? Judge: ...Not a psychic one, at any rate. Phoenix: (Well, at least the insult wasn't directed at me this time.) Judge: You lawyers are a desperate lot, aren't you. Phoenix: Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'll get it right this time! Leads back to: \"This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.\" The Inner Sanctum Leads to: \"Mr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side!\" Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side! That's the only place from which he could've seen the shadowy figures! Ihmus: Hoo-haaaaaah! Nahyuta: .........Ngh! Maya: Really?! Wow, I didn't even think of that! Judge: But wasn't the Inner Sanctum off-limits to all but the victim and the accused? Phoenix: And the third party who was there, you mean. I get the feeling that's a subject Prosecutor Sahdmadhi would rather not touch right now. Nahyuta: ..................... Judge: Ah, you mean...! Phoenix: That's right. This witness was at the scene of the crime. Which means he is the mysterious third party we saw during the Divination S\u00e9ance. He could be the one who dressed as Lady Kee'ra and killed the high priest! Ihmus: Goo-geeeeeeh! Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaat?! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: No one but the two participants were allowed anywhere near the Inner Sanctum. And the only way up there are the stairs that start down at the Plaza of Devotion. So tell me: How do you propose the witness entered that sacred space? Phoenix: Oh, umm... He must've, uhhh... (I haven't thought THAT far ahead...) Judge: The sanctum has sheer cliffs on three sides and a steep, towering rock face on the other. No one could have made it there by climbing the faces of those cliffs. Nahyuta: His Magistry speaks true. To say Mr. Ihmus was at such an inaccessible location is but a bid to tarnish his credibility. Is that not right? Ihmus: Right! I wasn't at the Inner Sanctum! No sir, no how! At least I'm pretty sure I wasn't! Phoenix: Phoenix: T-Then, what about those silhouettes you claim to have seen? Ihmus: I'm starting to think I've been imagining things! Phoenix: What?! Th... This is insane! Gallery: I knew we couldn't trust that lawyer. He's trying to frame the witness! Judge: Peace! Peace, I say! Phoenix: (This is impossible! Unless I can show how he got to the Inner Sanctum... ...it just looks like I'm trying to slander Mr. Ihmus.) Maya: I believe in you, Nick! Rah, rah, siss boom bah! Fight, fight, Phoenix Wright! Gallery: Just look at the accused. Has she no shame? Maya: What's your problem, lady?! Phoenix Wright is very trustworthy, I'll have you know! Gallery: She's got some nerve for a criminal! I bet that lawyer poisoned her mind. Phoenix: P-Please, Maya, you're only making it worse. I appreciate the vote of confidence, but it's probably best to keep it to yourself for now... Judge: I would advise the defense to think carefully before making any more sudden outbursts. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Magistry... (If I wasn't the bad guy before, I definitely am now!) Nahyuta: Now, Mr. Ihmus. I would like you to think back carefully... ...before you testify next about where you were that night. Witness Testimony -- I Wasn't at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: I was never at the Inner Sanctum, I tell ya! That much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory. Besides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place! Boy, you lawyers sure are scary! Phoenix: (I guess it might've been impossible for him to get to the Inner Sanctum like he claims, but...) Nahyuta: Now will you desist in trying to frame this innocent witness? Gallery: Yeah! I'd like to see you explain how he got up there! Judge: Mr. Wright. Is it not time to end these cross-examinations? Nahyuta: \"A moment of desperation leads to one hundred million years of torment.\" (Changed from ['A moment of desperation leads to 100 million years of torment.'] in the original release) It means that for each moment a sinner spends struggling to deny their sins... ...one hundred million years of torment are added to their time in hell. (Changed from [...100 million years of torment are added to their time in hell.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Khura'inism is the strictest religion ever!) Nahyuta: And just so you know, you've already accrued two hundred million extra years. (Changed from [And just so you know, you've already accrued 200 million extra years.] in the original release) Gallery: Plus the five they started with... that's seven hundred million years of torment! (Changed from [Plus the 500 million years they started with... that's 700 million years of torment!] in the original release) Maya: Sure, what's another two hundred million, give or take. (Changed from [Sure, what's another 200 million, give or take.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Well, it's a big deal to me! I can't keep saying that the witness was there at the Inner Sanctum... ...if I can't prove it. The problem is, how am I going to do that?) Cross-Examination -- I Wasn't at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: I was never at the Inner Sanctum, I tell ya! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure you weren't there? Ihmus: All I'm sure of is that you're deeply skeptical! Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, are all lawyers always like this? Nahyuta: Most certainly. They always try to pin crimes on innocent witnesses, without any proof whatsoever. They are no better than bacteria or viruses. Ihmus: Yikes! You mean he's contagious?! He's gonna give me... lawyer-itis! Phoenix: (Okay, this is getting ridiculous.) Ihmus: Whew, that was a close one. He almost put me there at the scene of the crime when I wasn't even there! Ihmus: That much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You just said your memory was fuzzy! Ihmus: I sure did. What's the big deal? Phoenix: I'll tell you what! Your testimony isn't very credible if your memory of the events is fuzzy! Ihmus: Oh, no worries there. My memory may be fuzzy, but I'm very clear on one thing! Phoenix: (Here we go again...) Ihmus: If you asked me whether or not I remember what I did that night, I'd say I do! Judge: In short, you are confident that your testimony is true. ...Is that correct, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: Har har har har har! Exactly! Guess ya don't get to be a judge for nothing! So, in closing, I can clearly say that I was totally not there! Ihmus: Besides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Hmm... I wonder if it really was impossible for you to get to the Inner Sanctum...? Nahyuta: If you have something to say, just say it. Phoenix: Couldn't there have been another way to get there? A way that wouldn't attract attention? Ihmus: No, there isn't! Phoenix: (Which means, there is.) Judge: Perhaps the defense would share its theory with us. Phoenix: (I don't even have a wild guess, let alone a theory, though. Time to reach into my bag of bluffs!) To reach the Inner Sanctum without attracting any attention... He climbed up the cliff Phoenix: No one would've noticed if he had scaled up the side of the mountain. He could've snuck into the Inner Sanctum that way! Ihmus: Har har har har har! The cliff face is all loose and crumbly 'round there. Even a pro mountain climber couldn't have made it up that way! Nahyuta: Everyone here in Khura'in knows that. But let us forgive the defense's ignorance -- he is a foreigner, after all. Phoenix: W-Why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things?! Ihmus: Tough luck, lawyer! I couldn't have gotten up to the Inner Sanctum by scaling the cliff! Phoenix: Arrrgh! ...Please add that to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus. Adds statement \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" if not already added or changes statement from \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" or \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" to \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" He came from the plaza Phoenix: Maybe you snuck up to the Inner Sanctum via the stairs in the Plaza of Devotion? Ihmus: Har har har har har! With all those people at the plaza?! I don't think so! Phoenix: But they were all completely absorbed in prayer. With a little stealth, you could've slipped by without drawing any attention! Nahyuta: I am afraid that would have been impossible. During the rite... ...the gate to the stairs was locked tight from the Inner Sanctum side. Phoenix: Wh-What?! Ihmus: Yeah! If I'd tried to force the lock open... ...someone there woulda noticed, even if they were deep in prayer! Phoenix: Nngh! ...P-Please add that to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus. Adds statement \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" if not already added or changes statement from \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" or \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" to \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" He fell from the sky Phoenix: Maybe you fell from the sky? Ihmus: Har har har har har! The lawyer thinks he's a comedian now! Nahyuta: I was wondering what crazy theory you would propose next. Well, defense, let's hear it. Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus could've... um... parachuted down! We already know the weather was clear, and there was no wind to speak of. Perfect weather for skydiving, I'd say! Nahyuta: Now that you have been backed into a corner, your delusions grow ever more delusional. The Inner Sanctum is on a tiny ledge upon a sheer cliff over two thousand meters tall. (Changed from [The Inner Sanctum is on a tiny ledge upon a sheer cliff over 2,000 meters tall.] in the original release) One misstep, and a skydiver would soon find themself in the Twilight Realm. Ihmus: Yeah! I don't care how still the wind was. Even I couldn't have made that jump! Phoenix: Wait! What's this building on top of the sacred mountain...? Nahyuta: That is Royal Penitentiary No. 4. Phoenix: (Oh, right. Princess Rayfa mentioned there was a prison up there.) How do you get your prisoners up there anyway? Nahyuta: By helicopter. But only with authorization from the minister of justice. He is the only one who can approve flights that pass over the Inner Sanctum. Mountain Range Poster updated in the Court Record. Nahyuta: Might I also add, defense... ...that no parachute or any other equipment necessary for skydiving have been found. Ihmus: Are ya saying I flew down there by flapping my arms? I may be an incredible dude, but even I'm not capable of that! Phoenix: Arngh... Well, please add that statement to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus. Adds statement \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" if not already added or changes statement from \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" or \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" to \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" He fell from the sky (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maybe you fell from the sky? Ihmus: Har har har har har! The lawyer thinks he's a comedian now! Nahyuta: I was wondering what crazy theory you would propose next. Well, defense, let's hear it. Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus could've... um... parachuted down! We already know the weather was clear, and there was no wind to speak of. Perfect weather for skydiving, I'd say!

The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" or \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" to \"It's not like I can fly through the air, either!\" Ihmus: No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You really couldn't climb your way up? Like, what if there was a route where the rock is more solid? Or maybe you're a celebrated rock climber. You know, something like that? Ihmus: As I said before, the rock's all loose and crumbly! And there's no route up there where the rock's more solid. Moreover, I've never rock climbed a day in my life! Judge: Any attempt to climb that mountain would be as good as throwing your life away. Phoenix: Aw, come on, Your Magistry... Judge: You continue to claim that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum. Yet said claim shall remain but a claim without any supporting evidence, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I realize that, Your Magistry. (If I can't find any inconsistencies, guess I can always try to elicit some more testimony.) Ihmus: The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who can verify that the gate was actually locked? I mean, what if it wasn't? Nahyuta: The high priest himself was seen locking it before the rite began. And we have many believers from the plaza who can corroborate this. Ihmus: Guess you struck out again, Mr. Lawyer Man! Phoenix: (What if there was a spare key to the gate? But I'm in no position to prove that, so... what now?) Judge: You continue to claim that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum. Yet said claim shall remain but a claim without any supporting evidence, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I realize that, Your Magistry. (If I can't find any inconsistencies, guess I can always try to elicit some more testimony.) Ihmus: It's not like I can fly through the air, either! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You wouldn't need to flap your arms if you had some gear. Nahyuta: As I have already stated... ...nothing of the sort was found in or around the scene of the crime. Ihmus: Har har har har har! I'd sure like to see some o' that so-called gear you're talking about! Phoenix: (I know, I know... But was there really nothing like that at the Inner Sanctum? What if there was something that could've been used as a parachute? I should give the evidence another look.) Judge: You continue to claim that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum. Yet said claim shall remain but a claim without any supporting evidence, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I realize that, Your Magistry. (If I can't find any inconsistencies, guess I can always try to elicit some more testimony.) Present Sanctum Prayer Flags Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Mr. Ihmus is right.\" Ihmus: Boy, you lawyers sure are scary! Press Phoenix: Now hold on. Lawyers aren't scary! Ihmus: But you're saying I was at the Inner Sanctum when I wasn't! Anyone who'd try to frame an innocent man like that is scary in my book! Gallery: LAWYERS ARE SCARY! LAWYERS ARE SCARY!IT'S A SETUP! IT'S DEFINITELY A SETUP! Phoenix: I'm not trying to set anyone up! I-I'm going to provide evidence and explain exactly how it was done. Nahyuta: The gallery speaks true. They know the depth of a lawyer's sin, and the poverty of his virtue. Phoenix: (There may be some bad apples, but we're not all like that, you know!) Maya: Don't worry, Nick! I'll still root for you, no matter how morally bankrupt you become! Phoenix: (Thanks a bunch, Maya...) Ihmus: Har har har har har! Phoenix: (Mr. Ihmus wasn't at the Inner Sanctum? Or more precisely, couldn't get there?) Maya: Hmm... I don't see a way out of this. Phoenix: Yeah, these kinds of debates only get worse if you argue them the wrong way. I'll have to pry some conclusive testimony out of him, and then present some evidence! Maya: Like when you're trying to catch frogs from a pond! Once you've got a grip on one, you'd better hold on tight! Phoenix: R-Right... Something like that. Phoenix: ...Mr. Ihmus is right. He couldn't have skydived down there without any gear. Ihmus: Well now, finally come around, have ya? Now you see that I couldn't have possibly been there at the Inner Sanctum! Phoenix: Right. ...If you didn't have any gear, that is. Ihmus: Wh-Wh-Whaaat on eaaaarth are you talking about?! Phoenix: (That overreaction is a dead giveaway that I'm on the right track!) Take a look at this piece of evidence! Judge: Those are prayer flags, are they not? Phoenix: Yes, but they have been sewn together... ...to create one big banner. A banner that could also function like a parachute! Nahyuta: Pohlkunka...! Phoenix: The people of Khura'in are so used to seeing prayer flags... ...that the police didn't even think twice about these flags during their investigation. Nahyuta: N-No, this cannot be! Phoenix: The witness landed at the Inner Sanctum by using these prayer flags as a parachute! Is that not right, Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: There's no way out. I'm surrounded! Phoenix: Um... Mr. Ihmus? Ihmus: All this talk's jogged my memory. I-I-I guess... I guess I WAS there at the Inner Sanctum after all! Nahyuta: Grrrrrr...! Phoenix: As I suspected, there WERE three people there that night! Maya: You did it, Nick! You weren't wrong, after all! Phoenix: Um, thanks? Mr. Ihmus. You were the one disguised as Lady Kee'ra that night, weren't you? Ihmus: Whaaa...?! N-No way, no how! Uhh... It's like this... Umm... Oh, yeah! I was only there at the Inner Sanctum by accident! Phoenix: By accident? Ihmus: Exactly! And that thing's not a parachute. It's a homemade paraglider! Phoenix: A paraglider? Are you telling me you could fly using that patchwork mess of material? Ihmus: It may not look like much, but it's as sturdy as can be! I rode the wind like an eagle, going higher and higher from my earthly launching point! But then something happened that forced me to land at the Inner Sanctum! Phoenix: So you just happened to land there? You expect me to believe that?! Judge: Now, now. Please calm yourself, Mr. Wright. However, the fact that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum is crucial testimony indeed. And it certainly warrants further explication. Therefore, let's continue with more testimony. Witness Testimony -- Why I Was at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: That evening, I was enjoying a trek through the night sky with my homemade paraglider. But just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened! An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum! As I landed, I banged my head, causing me to lose my memory! So you see, I ended up at the Inner Sanctum purely by accident! Nahyuta: Mr. Ihmus, you failed to mention any of this during your pre-trial questioning. Ihmus: Can't be helped! I mean, I'm just remembering it now! Nahyuta: Continue such slipshod testimony and you will be cast into the Hell of Hangnails... ...where you shall have hangnails grown and ripped out for eight hundred million years. (Changed from [...where you shall have hangnails grown and ripped out for 800 million years.] in the original release) Ihmus: HOO-HAAAAAAH! ...I think I'll pass on that! Phoenix: (Looks like that caught Prosecutor Sahdmadhi off-guard. This is my chance to rip his case to shreds!) Cross-Examination -- Why I Was at the Inner Sanctum -- Ihmus: That evening, I was enjoying a trek through the night sky with my homemade paraglider. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were enjoying a trek through the night sky with your homemade paraglider? You didn't go to pray? Ihmus: A devout Khura'inist like me can pray anywhere -- even while flying through the sky! But I wouldn't recommend you try it. You're bound to end up dead! Har har har har har! Maya: A paraglider? I didn't see anything like that! Ihmus: That's 'cause o' the ritual curtain! It blocked your view! You shoulda seen me, majestically soaring between the mountains! Maya: R-Really? ...What do you think, Nick? Phoenix: D-Don't ask me. Ihmus: Har har har! I was really enjoying that flight! At first, anyway... Ihmus: But just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Something terrible happened? Ihmus: Exactly! And when I say terrible, I mean TERRIBLE! Phoenix: What? Was there something unexpected near Mt. Poniponi? Ihmus: Err... What was it again? Phoenix: ...Wait, you don't remember? Ihmus: Uhh... Let's just say it was terrible! Ihmus: An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What exactly was this \"accident\" you had? Ihmus: Good question. Now what was it again...? ...Wind? Oh yeah, it was the wind! And not just any wind, but a sudden gale force wind. Made me lose control. Phoenix: The wind was strong enough to make you lose control? Ihmus: Ya got that right. Phoenix: Okay, then. Please add that to your testimony. Changes statement from \"An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum!\" to \"Gale force winds came out of nowhere, so I made an emergency landing at the sanctum!\" Ihmus: Gale force winds came out of nowhere, so I made an emergency landing at the sanctum! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Had the wind been blowing the whole time around the mountains? Ihmus: Yep! Just the right amount o' wind for paragliding! So that sudden gale force wind was a real shocker! Phoenix: I see. So a decent wind had been blowing until then. Ihmus: Right! A paraglider's not much use without a decent wind! Present May 9th Newspaper Phoenix: Leads to: \"We have a saying in my country, Mr. Ihmus:\" Ihmus: As I landed, I banged my head, causing me to lose my memory! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where at the Inner Sanctum did you land? Ihmus: That's easy! Where the paraglider ended up! Phoenix: (I guess that makes sense. So, outside the ritual curtain, on the side where the moonlight shadows were cast.) Ihmus: But right as I landed, I hit my head on a rock! I lost both my consciousness and my memory! Haaar har har har har! Phoenix: (Something's seriously wrong with this guy.) Ihmus: So you see, I ended up at the Inner Sanctum purely by accident! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're lucky to be alive after an accident like that. Ihmus: Yeah, I'm just a lucky kinda guy! It's times like these that separate the men from the boys! Phoenix: Wow, I'd say you were incredibly lucky... Almost miraculously so. Ihmus: If ya got something to say, just say it! Phoenix: ...All right, Mr. Ihmus. It wasn't an accident, was it? You landed at the Inner Sanctum on purpose. Ihmus: Wh-What the--?! No, it was an accident, I'm telling ya! You don't even have any proof! So stop making things up about me! Phoenix: (His testimony's like a moving target!) Maya: Okay, Nick! Time for some evidence. You know, really grab him by the scruff of his neck! Phoenix: O-One thing at a time, Maya. First, I have to find an inconsistency. (But where there is constantly changing testimony... ...there are bound to be discrepancies and other issues!) Phoenix: We have a saying in my country, Mr. Ihmus: \"From one lie sprouts another.\" (Changed from ['One lie begets another.'] in the original release) Ihmus: Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: It means someone caught lying will lie again in an attempt to conceal their first lie. In other words, this current testimony is just a blatant lie you're telling to cover your tracks! Ihmus: What did you just say?! Phoenix: You claimed gale force winds caused you to lose control... ...but this newspaper has the weather report for the day of the murder. It says, \"The area around the Inner Sanctum will enjoy calm, clear skies today.\" Ihmus: P-P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa! Judge: Why, I do believe it does say that! Maya: \"From one lie sprouts another\"... That makes sense, but... (Chagned from [One lie begets another... That makes sense, but...] in the original release) Is it really a saying back home? I've never heard of it. Phoenix: Yeah... I kind of made that one up. Maya: For real? Phoenix: Your Magistry! The witness's testimony contains another flaw -- one that's even more fatal to his cause. Judge: More fatal, you say? The defense will explain himself at once! Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus claims he was flying up around the Inner Sanctum with his paraglider. But it would've been impossible to get all the way up there without any wind! Judge: Why, yes! I believe you're right! But we know the witness was at the Inner Sanctum, so... Mr. Ihmus! How did you get there?! And from where? Ihmus: ........................... Phoenix: (Without any wind, he couldn't have flown up there from the bottom of the mountain. By process of elimination... ...the only starting point that makes ANY sense is...!) Your Magistry, I believe I have the answer to your question. To reach the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here! Present Royal Penitentiary No. 4 Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hoo-hah! ...Are you insane?!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: This was his starting point! Nahyuta: Do you truly believe he arrived at the Inner Sanctum from there? Phoenix: Yes! Positive! Judge: Hmm... I fail to see how he could have reached the Inner Sanctum from there. Phoenix: (...Of course. What was I thinking?) Nahyuta: You are a fool. Such an answer is no better than what a monkey might offer. Judge: Now now, let us not be cruel. Even a monkey could point out a more probable location. Phoenix: (Great. Now the judge thinks I'm lower than a monkey.) Nahyuta: So, the lawyer was monkeying around when he claimed Mr. Ihmus flew down from above. Phoenix: No, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. The witness DID fly down from above. With that in mind... To get to the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here! Leads back to examination Ihmus: Hoo-hah! ...Are you insane?! Judge: Th-That's where he came from?! Phoenix: If he couldn't have come from below, the only other option is from above. So you see, A'nohn Ihmus came down from Royal Penitentiary No. 4! From there, he could have easily reached the Inner Sanctum by parachute! And that means he might have also killed the high priest! Judge: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Phoenix: Mr. Ihmus! Were you the third party at the Inner Sanctum?! And the one behind the warning to halt the rite that the victim received?! Was it you we saw in his final memory?! Are you the rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra?! Ihmus: HOOOOOOOOO-HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, sir! Help me out here! Nahyuta: .................. Maya: You did it! You finally left him speechless! Ihmus: Aw, c'mon, Mr. Prosecutor Man! Nahyuta: ...Quiet, you fool. You should use this time to prepare yourself for what is to come. For a fate far worse than Hangnail Hell awaits you now. Ihmus: ......... Nahyuta: Well done, defense. I must concede this point to you. The witness did, in fact, descend to the Inner Sanctum from Royal Penitentiary No. 4. Phoenix: (Huh? He didn't even put up a fight this time. That's awfully... generous of him.) Nahyuta: But if you are as perceptive as you seem, then surely you've already figured out the riddle. ...The riddle of A'nohn Ihmus's true identity. Phoenix: Oh, umm... (His true identity? Not sure I know quite yet, but I guess I'll have to answer with something...) Judge: ...It would seem I am the only one still in the dark here. Would the defense care to enlighten me? Who is this man we've been calling A'nohn Ihmus? Phoenix: The witness's true identity is... Present Wanted Poster Leads to: \"Is this really him?!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Hm? I fail to see how that shines any light on the matter. Nahyuta: That's because it doesn't. This piece of evidence has nothing to do with the witness's identity. Phoenix: I was just testing Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, to see if he really knew! Judge: ...It seems you are the clueless one here, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Couldn't bluff my way out of that one... Hmm... If he was at Royal Penitentiary No. 4 before he landed at the Inner Sanctum... ...then he must be...!) Judge: Unless you wish to be removed from this Hall of Justice, I suggest you think carefully. What is A'nohn Ihmus's true identity? Leads back to: \"The witness's true identity is...\" Phoenix: (Is this really him?!) Nahyuta: Hmph. Only now do you realize the truth. Well? Please do share with us your belated insight. Phoenix: Umm... Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Why are you holding back?! (Changed from [What's wrong, Nick? Just say it!] in the original release) Phoenix: Because this isn't going to be very helpful to our case... Maya: Really?! Are you sure? Phoenix: (Unfortunately, I've got no other choice.) That scruffy beard and shaggy mane completely threw me off. But it's all becoming clear now. The nighttime B.A.S.E. jump from the mountaintop prison... The precision landing at the Inner Sanctum using only a homemade parachute... Ihmus: ..................... Phoenix: Only a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is Datz Are'bal -- prison escapee and key member of Dhurke's rebel group! Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAAT?! Ihmus: GAAAH-HAAAAAAH! Judge: The witness is an escaped prisoner?! Nahyuta: Precisely. The police have been scouring every corner of the city to no avail. Meanwhile, here he was under our noses the entire time. Ihmus: Hoo-haaaaaaaaaaaah! Didn't think anyone would see through my clever disguise! Nahyuta: Heh heh heh. But the witness's charade is not all that has been shattered. ...Is it, defense? Phoenix: (Boy, do I hate this guy...) Nahyuta: Please recall the defense's own words... Phoenix: Whoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, \"Do not perform the rite.\" But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered. Judge: Who do you suppose sent that letter? Phoenix: A person with something to hide -- the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra herself! Nahyuta: He claimed that the real killer was \"the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra.\" Maya: Yeah, and what's your point?! Nahyuta: What of the witness's true identity? Phoenix: Only a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is Datz Are'bal -- prison escapee and key member of Dhurke's rebel group! Maya: *gasp* Oh no! Nahyuta: He is a rebel and an escaped prisoner. He could not possibly have been Lady Kee'ra, mortal enemy of the rebels! Maya: Nooooooooooo! Nahyuta: ...Now, perhaps the witness will enlighten us to the truth. After all, he has yet to refute any of this. Ihmus: Hoo-haaah! Ya got me! I'm the razor-sharp fangs of the Defiant Dragons! Datz: ...Datz Are'bal! Nahyuta: When did you get your memory back? Datz: Oh, around the time you guys were talking about there being no wind. But ya gotta gimme credit for making up all that testimony off the top o' my head! Phoenix: Are you prepared to tell us the truth now? Datz: Well, it's true I parachuted down to the Inner Sanctum...  ...but I banged my head on impact, and ended up unconscious outside the ritual curtain! In short, all my eyewitness testimony was a big fat lie. Phoenix: A big fat LIIIIIIEE?! Datz: Oh, and by the way! Long time no see... Yuty! Nahyuta: ......... Phoenix: (Wait... They know each other?) Nahyuta: Your Magistry. This filthy rebel belongs in a jail cell. Judge: Oh, yes! Of course! Bailiff, seize him at once! Datz: Seems ya really have forgotten the will of the dragon, huh, Yuty. But I haven't. And no dogs of the Ga'ran regime are gonna lay a finger on me! ...Alley-oop! Nahyuta: Deploy all available resources! I want all units placed on high alert! Judge: The escaped prisoner... escaped again. Nahyuta: The police force has been placed on high alert. He will be caught before long. Maya: An escaped prisoner who's escaped the law again after giving a ton of false testimony... Talk about a troublemaker. Phoenix: He really pulled a number on all of us. (What was the point of all that, anyway?) Judge: Well, I can't help but feel that entire episode was an enormous waste of time. Nahyuta: ...Your Magistry. Perhaps it was not as great of a waste as you might believe. Judge: What makes you say that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: Datz Are'bal dropped something as he made his escape from these halls. Phoenix: (Hm? That scrap of paper looks awfully familiar.) Nahyuta: These appear to be direct orders from Dhurke. Judge: From Dhurke?! The rebel leader?! Oh, but we only have a small corner of it... Phoenix: (Wait, I remember now...!) Your Magistry, I've seen that scrap of paper before! Judge: You have? Phoenix: The scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this. Present Bloodstained Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"And this is...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Take a look at this. This could be related to the scrap of paper Mr. Are'bal dropped. Judge: Really? Because I fail to see the connection. Phoenix: I suspected as much. Okay, on to the next piece of evidence. Judge: One moment, Mr. Wright! We move on when I say it's time to move on! Phoenix: Arngh, can't you let it slide once in a while? (I better carefully compare the scrap of paper Mr. Are'bal dropped to the evidence I have.) Judge: I will ask the defense once more. Where have you seen this scrap of paper before? Leads back to: \"The scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this.\" Judge: And this is...? Phoenix: I found it at the scene of the crime. It appears to be a copy of the order that Mr. Are'bal dropped. If we put the two together, we should be able to read what the order says! Judge: Oh, my! And just what does it say, Mr. Wright?! Phoenix: ..................... I can't read Khura'inese. Judge: Ah... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, if you please. Nahyuta: The ignorant lawyer has not bothered to learn our language? Very well, then... .............................. ...I do not understand. Phoenix: Well? Wh-What does it say?! Nahyuta: Using the lamplights as a landmark, he was to parachute down to the Inner Sanctum. Upon the rite's completion, he was to don Lady Kee'ra's robes and make his escape. Judge: What?! That is how he was to escape from prison?! Phoenix: (So, if I were to assume that Mr. Are'bal was the one who killed the high priest... ...then maybe it was because Abbot Inmee tried to thwart his escape plan...?) Nahyuta: O foul lawyer... I'm afraid that is simply ludicrous. Phoenix: Huh? B-But I didn't say anything. (D-Did he just read my mind?) Nahyuta: I know how your putrid mind works. Unfortunately for you, however, now that the rebel's escape plan has been revealed... ...it is clear that Datz Are'bal is not the high priest's killer. Phoenix: H-How can you be so sure?! Nahyuta: If only you would use that putrid brain of yours every once in a while. Datz Are'bal's plan could not have worked without the help of a certain individual. Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean? Nahyuta: I am speaking of Abbot Inmee, of course. Had Datz Are'bal simply donned Lady Kee'ra's robes and made his escape alone... ...he would have been far too conspicuous. But were he by the high priest's side... ...the faithful citizens praying in the plaza would have had no cause to suspect anything. It is, therefore, unthinkable that Datz Are'bal was the high priest's killer! Phoenix: AUGH! Judge: S-So then, you're saying...! The high priest was a...?! Oh, I cannot bear to say it! Nahyuta: I am afraid it is so. He numbered among the rebels who threaten our kingdom. Judge: How could this be?! Gallery: ...The high priest... a rebel?Th-There must be some kind of mistake! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: ...Let it go, and move on. Accept the truth. It is the only way. And that goes double for you, defense. Cease your futile battle now. Phoenix: And why should I? Nahyuta: Because I will now put the final nail in the coffin of the accused. Now that we have eliminated Datz Are'bal from our list of suspects... ...there is only one person that still remains: the accused, Maya Fey. Phoenix: Phoenix: Hold it right there! Aren't you forgetting something important? Judge: Something... important? Please do explain, defense. Phoenix: We can't end this trial without looking into... The arrow Phoenix: What about the arrow that was fired into the high priest's house?! Nahyuta: It was simply a means to deliver the warning letter to the victim. Phoenix: (Hmm...That's more or less the same conclusion we came to yesterday...) You know... I guess you're right. Judge: Oh? Then THIS should be just about right as well! It seems there is no need to continue this trial any longer. Phoenix: No, Your Magistry. There is still something important that must be brought to light! Leads back to: \"We can't end this trial without looking into...\" The murder weapon Phoenix: What about the murder weapon?! We haven't found it yet! Nahyuta: What does it matter if it has been found or not? The fact remains that the victim was killed with it by the accused. Judge: I also fail to see how that would be important, Mr. Wright. This, however, is. It seems there is no need to continue this trial any longer. Phoenix: No, Your Magistry. There is still something important that must be brought to light! Leads back to: \"We can't end this trial without looking into...\" The third party Leads to: \"I'm talking about the true identity of the Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance vision! Phoenix: I'm talking about the true identity of the Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance vision! If that wasn't Datz Are'bal, then who was it?! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: That matter has already been resolved. Phoenix: It has? (What's he talking about?) Nahyuta: It is as I have maintained from the start. There was no third party in the S\u00e9ance vision. Phoenix: Phoenix: B-But there was another Lady Kee'ra there besides Maya Fey! We all saw her! Nahyuta: Phoenix: (Wh-What the--?! I... I can't do my finger point!) Nahyuta: Hrnh! Phoenix: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Nahyuta: ...It is time to let it go, and move on. Your fate has already been sealed, much like your arm. Phoenix: (Th-This hardly seems fair.) Nahyuta: It is quite simple once you consider where the victim and the accused were at the time. If the victim was near the spring with his back to the accused, what would he see ahead? Judge: Besides the water itself... there is nothing but the warbaa'd statue. Nahyuta: Precisely. The Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance is the warbaa'd statue draped in her sacred robes! Phoenix: N-NOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAY! Nahyuta: The accused wanted the false Lady Kee'ra to appear in the S\u00e9ance vision... ...before she came from behind and stabbed the victim with the dagger in a reverse grip. Judge: But why would the accused want to do something like create a false Lady Kee'ra? Nahyuta: To show it to the victim as he was being slain. Judge: And what reason would the accused have to fool the victim she was about to kill? Nahyuta: It was not the victim she was trying to fool. ...It was this very court itself. Judge: Come again? Nahyuta: Suspicion would not fall on the accused if it looked as if another Lady Kee'ra was there. And the defense was foolish enough to fall for it and claim it was a third party in disguise. Judge: Are... Are you saying...?! Nahyuta: I am. It was all a cleverly wicked scheme, perpetrated by the accused. A scheme in which she sought to use the S\u00e9ance vision to mislead us! Phoenix: (This can't be happening!) Nahyuta: What a face you are making, defense. I am surprised you are taking this so hard. After all, did I not clearly state a while back... ...that you were chasing after naught but a deluded fantasy? Nahyuta: Heh heh heh... Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a deluded fantasy. Phoenix: (You're telling me he knew this is how it would turn out all the way back then...? And that he was just waiting for the most effective moment to spring it on me?!) Nahyuta: Heh heh heh. Do you understand now? I have had you dancing in the palm of my hand this entire time. Phoenix: It... It can't be--! Judge: This is an outrage! You took our royal priestess's sacred Divination S\u00e9ance... ...and used it to commit this most foul and despicable murder?! Maya: N-No! I did nothing of the sort! Phoenix: (Maya...) Maya: Nick! It's not true! I... I didn't...! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Cease this ugly display. Your fate is sealed now that the facts have been exposed. Your Magistry. The time has come to convict this criminal who only seeks to taint this sacred hall. Judge: Indeed. It seems this trial is over. Phoenix: Judge: Does the defense wish to offer up yet another counterargument or something? Phoenix: Umm... The accused is... uhh... is not the killer! And uh... here's why... (Now what do I do!? I've got nothing!) Judge: It would appear that the defense has run out of arguments to make. Phoenix: (I thought for sure that that rebel was the killer! The only person with a possible motive -- the one dressed as Lady Kee'ra -- has vanished. And I've got nothing to use against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's argument! Damn it! I can't lose now! Not like this!) Judge: Very well then, I shall now render my verdict. Phoenix: W-Wait! Please, wait! I'm begging you! Nahyuta: It is time to let it go, and move on. Judge: This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... Guilty Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Bailiff: Your Magistry! Please forgive the interruption, but... Judge: What is the meaning of this?! Bailiff: A body has been found in the Plaza of Devotion, Your Magistry! Nahyuta: ...What's this? Phoenix: (A body? What happened now?) Bailiff: And we found this sticking out of the victim. Judge: Wh-Why that's... Lady Kee'ra's Warbaa'd Dagger! Gallery: Lady Kee'ra! She has returned from the Twilight Realm once more!She has come to defeat the rebels! Judge: Peace! Nahyuta: Well, it would seem the dagger that was once lost has now been found. Bailiff: I have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: Yes? Bailiff: This dagger... It bears the fingerprints of Maya Fey on it! Phoenix: WHA-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Maya: B-But... Phoenix: (Why would Maya's prints be on it?) Nahyuta: .............................. I cannot believe it, yet it must be true... Judge: Is something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Nahyuta: This trial has run its course, and the accused's guilt has been firmly established. However... ...it would seem the defense was right about one thing. Phoenix: I-I was? Nahyuta: You claimed that the murder at the Inner Sanctum... ...had been carried out by the rebel hunter masquerading as Lady Kee'ra. Phoenix: I did say something to that effect, but what of it? Judge: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! A-Are you suggesting what I think you are? Nahyuta: I believe the true identity of the rebel hunter who has been masquerading as Lady Kee'ra... ...is none other than the accused, Ms. Maya Fey! Phoenix: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat?! Maya: Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?! Judge: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Nahyuta: I realize how shocking this must seem. Looking back, however, I now realize there was much that pointed to this fact. The rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra was first sighted about two years ago. And the accused first came to our kingdom two years ago as well. Judge: Wh-Why, the timing matches perfectly! Nahyuta: But there is more... That warning letter was found in the high priest's bedroom three days before the rite. Despite his house being locked up tight that night. Phoenix: Phoenix: How does that prove anything?! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: It is difficult to believe an intruder could have found a way to enter such a secure house. However, the accused was known to come and go freely there. ...Mainly to prepare for the Purification Rite. Phoenix: Ah! Maya: Abbot Inmee was an important figure with a ton of duties, including training acolytes. He was really kind, even to a foreigner like me. He even invited me over to his house whenever I was between training sessions. Nahyuta: The accused could have easily left the house unlocked for herself without anyone noticing. Phoenix: Nooooooooooooooo! Lady Kee'ra's Warning updated in the Court Record. Nahyuta: If we assume that the accused was Lady Kee'ra... ...that more than establishes her motive for killing the high priest. Judge: Yes, the victim was secretly an insurgent, bent on helping Datz Are'bal escape, after all. Nahyuta: Precisely. That made him a target of Lady Kee'ra's wrath. And after killing the high priest, she then unleashed her divine justice on another rebel. So, it seems the scope of this case has expanded. We now have... two murders perpetrated by Ms. Maya Fey, masquerading as Lady Kee'ra. Judge: .................. If Ms. Fey is indeed a serial killer, it would affect the severity of her punishment. In light of this, I believe this second murder must be investigated before we can proceed. Nahyuta: As you wish, Your Magistry. Maya Fey, I hereby charge you with this second murder. May your defiled soul feel the weight of your sins. Phoenix: (A new murder charge on top of a guilty verdict?) Judge: It seems the defense will live to see one more day. Phoenix: (Talk about \"hanging on by a thread\"...) Nahyuta: Heh heh heh. Come tomorrow, a far more terrible punishment awaits you. Judge: I hereby suspend these proceedings so that the second murder may be investigated. Until the conclusion of this new investigation, this court is adjourned! To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: That statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence. Nahyuta: Let it go, and move on. Abandon this folly. You know very well your evidence proves nothing. Phoenix: Nice try, but you can't make me give up. I'm going to prove I'm right! Judge: You can point your finger as much as you want, but you're simply wasting your time. It is a pitiful sight to see a lawyer who doesn't know when he is beat. Phoenix: (Argh... I just need to hang in there a little longer.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Anything come to mind? Nahyuta: ............ Judge: ............ Phoenix: W-Well...? Judge: Hm? Did the defense have something he would like to say? Phoenix: (That fell on deaf ears.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Judge: Is something the matter? Phoenix: Sorry. That scream just sort of slipped out. Judge: I don't know about trials in your country, but we refrain from such rash outbursts here. Perhaps this will deter any future urges you might have. Phoenix: (I'm not helping my case in the judge's eyes, both literally and figuratively.) Presenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination S\u00e9ance (on initial Insight) Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision? Rayfa: Inconsistent...? I think not! Phoenix: Exactly! That's where the inconsistency lies! Judge: No, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies. Phoenix: (Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...) Maya: Hmm... Phoenix: What is it, Maya? Maya: I'm... still trying to figure this whole Insight thing out. When the words change size... ...that means the intensity of those sensations is changing, too, right? Phoenix: That's what it looks like to me. Maya: So then... that's probably something we should keep an eye on, too. In short, we should be on the lookout for... ...changes that shouldn't take place, but they do anyway... ...and changes that don't occur when they should. Phoenix: How very perceptive of you. (I guess all that training's sharpened Maya's mind along with her powers.) Phoenix: Let's compare the vision to the Insights, while looking for changes in sensory intensity! Maya: Sounds like a plan! Presenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination S\u00e9ance (on all revised Insights) Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision? Rayfa: Inconsistent...? I think not! Phoenix: Exactly! That's where the inconsistency lies! Judge: No, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies. Phoenix: (Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...) Consult (during a cross-examination, when evidence must be presented) Maya: Looks like you can't count on your bluffing skills to save your butt this time. Phoenix: Yeah... This is a tough one. Maya: Well, to me, there's something about this one statement that seems off. Phoenix: Yeah, it does sound a little strange, doesn't it? Thanks, Maya. I'll take another look at the evidence. Maya: You can always count on me! Consult (during a cross-examination, when statements must be pressed) Maya: You're looking a little pale there, Nick. Are you all right? Phoenix: This trial is really putting me through the wringer. Maya: Maybe it's just a matter of getting the information you need. Phoenix: Right... Thanks, Maya. (Guess I'd better keep pressing, then!) Maya: Once you get more info, you can use it to make one of your famous bluffs! Phoenix: (She makes it sound like bluffing is my default move.) Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on initial Insight) Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Phoenix: Um, I'm having a tough time spotting a contradiction. Maya: Well, there was one sensation that caught my eye. You know that footsteps sensation? Didn't something about it seem strange to you? Phoenix: Now that you mention it... Thanks. I'll focus on that as I review the Insights. Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on first revised Insight) Maya: You're making that \"I-can't-find-a-contradiction\" face of yours again, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah, well... I'm kinda clutching at straws here. Maya: And I think we should focus on the sound of bells that were just uncovered. Phoenix: You're right. Let's focus on that sensation and take another look at Rayfa's Insights. Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on second revised Insight) Maya: You look like you're having a tough time, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah, because I can't find any contradictions. I mean, the sensations in the vision all seem perfectly fine to me... Maya: In that case, why don't you read the Insights while focusing on what the victim saw? Phoenix: (Of course! His sense of sight! Time to go over those Insights again!) Consult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on third revised Insight) Phoenix: Maya... I can't find any contradictions. Maya: Come on, Nick. A bit early to throw in the towel, don't you think? Phoenix: But I didn't notice anything wrong with the sensations that appeared as words just now. Maya: Well then, maybe the contradiction is in what Abbot Inmee saw. I think there's something fishy about the things that we can more clearly see now. Also... We should focus on not only the sensations, but the updated Insights, as well. Phoenix: Right. Thanks, Maya! Too many penalties Judge: This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... Guilty The Rite of Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 11, 1:03 PMTehm'pul Temple Phoenix: (What do I do now...? I can't believe Maya and I were actually found guilty...) Judge: This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey...  ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... Guilty Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Ahlbi: M-M-M-Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ahlbi! Ahlbi: I saw the whole trial! What's going to happen to Miss Maya now? Phoenix: ...I'm worried about that, too. But right now... Bailiff: I have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: Yes? Bailiff: This dagger... It bears the fingerprints of Maya Fey on it! Phoenix: Right now, I need to focus on the next trial. Ahlbi: The murder of Acolyte Zeh'lot, right? Phoenix: At least the jury is still out on that one, so to speak. (The two murders are most likely connected. If I can get to the bottom of Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder... ...it might give me the ammunition I need to overturn Maya's guilty verdict.) Ahlbi: Let me help you investigate! I want to assist you any way I can! Phoenix: I appreciate it, Ahlbi, but we're talking about a murder. Ahlbi: Yeah, but it's going to be hard for a foreigner to investigate this on his own! Phoenix: You have a point there. Phoenix: (Hmm... I wish I knew what to do.) Rayfa: ..................... Phoenix: (Hm? Isn't that...?) ...Your Benevolence. Rayfa: ............... Phoenix: Um, Princess Rayfa? Rayfa: Hm? ...Oh, it is you again. ...The dead lawyer walking, guilty of abetting a murderer under the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: Urk! (I see she hasn't lost any of her charm.) Rayfa: ........................... Phoenix: Why the long face? I thought you'd be glad I was found guilty under the DC Act. Rayfa: ...Hmph. I am in no mood to take joy in your suffering. For I was unable to defeat you, and had to leave the job to others. I failed in my sacred duty as the royal priestess. Phoenix: I guess that answers my question.) Rayfa: Have I misunderstood... the voice of the mitamah... yet again? ...Th-This--! This cannot be! Rayfa: .................. Phoenix: (All I did was defend my client... Nngh... I can't bear to see her looking so sad like this, though...) ...Your Benevolence. Rayfa: .................. Phoenix: Your Benevolence! Rayfa: Hm? Oh, Barbed Head. I thought you had already begun your journey to the Twilight Realm. Phoenix: I'm not dead yet! I still have an investigation to do... for tomorrow's trial. Rayfa: What's this?! D-Do you mean to say... ...you have not given up yet? Phoenix: That's right. I'm going to prove Maya innocent tomorrow. Rayfa: ............ But why? Why do you refuse to give up? I cannot fathom such obstinacy. Investigate all you want -- I care not! Phoenix: ...You really don't mind? But aren't you worried that a lawyer backed into a corner by the DC Act... ...might do something desperate, like forge evidence? Rayfa: What's this?! Phoenix: If left unsupervised, I'd be free to do whatever I wanted, you know. Rayfa: ............Grrr! Phoenix: (Okay, now to see if she takes the bait.) Rayfa: Yes... I see your point. Barbed Head... Phoenix: Yes? Rayfa: I know what happened yesterday. You perpetrated some sort of fraud or other misdeed while I was not watching! Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: That explains why I misunderstood the voice of the high priest's soul! Yes, of course! That is the only explanation! Phoenix: ............ (I was just trying to cheer her up. Now she thinks even less of me.) Rayfa: I must not allow you to sully our sacred Hall of Justice with your misdeeds ever again. Therefore, today, I will be monitoring your every move once more! I will not fail to spot your misdeeds this time! The moment I see anything out of the ordinary, I will send you straight to prison. And you, boy. Do not throw your lot in with this foreign devil. Ahlbi: ...B-But... Your Benevolence! Phoenix: It's okay, Ahlbi. You don't need to worry about me. I'll be back before you know it. (But first, I should probably lighten my load a bit.) Ahlbi, would you mind holding on to some evidence for me? Ahlbi: Of course not! I'm always glad to help! Unnecessary evidence unloaded onto Ahlbi. Ahlbi: May the Holy Mother's blessings be upon you! Phoenix: (Now then... The scene of the crime is the logical place to start. If I recall correctly, the body was found at the Plaza of Devotion.) Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: That boy has grown far too close to you. He will require re-education if he persists in befriending lawyers. Phoenix: Re-education? What exactly does that entail? Rayfa: First, he must meditate upon Lady Kee'ra for forty-eight hours in the prayer pose. Phoenix: How is that re-education? It sounds more like torture to me. What to do Rayfa: Barbed Head! You have an investigation to conduct, do you not?! Get on with it! Phoenix: Y-Yes, but... (Why does she always have to be like this?) Rayfa: What? Would you have preferred that tour guide boy tag along instead? Phoenix: Huh?! Oh, umm... Rayfa: Hmph, it would appear I have read your mind most accurately. Phoenix: (That smile of hers is downright scary.) Bazaar Examine Warbaa'd RAWWWRRR! Phoenix: Aaaaaaah! What the heck was that?! Rayfa: Honestly, what sort of grown man jumps at the call of a warbaa'd? Phoenix: What? That roar came from this bird? ...I-It is a bird, right? Rayfa: W-Well... give me a moment! ...Nayna! The warbaa'd has many natural enemies. Therefore, it mimics a lion's roar in order to scare them away. But you did not know that, did you? And you call yourself a lawyer! Hmph! Phoenix: You didn't know, either, until you asked Nayna. Rayfa: Enough! You... You... lamebrain! Yak Rayfa: Have you never seen a yak before, Barbed Head? Phoenix: Only in zoos. Rayfa: Well in Khura'in, they play an important part in our daily lives. Therefore, they must be treated with kindness and with respect. MOOOOOOOOO! Rayfa: H-Hey! What are doing?! I command you to cease that at once! Phoenix: (Wow... That yak is really licking and nuzzling the daylights out of Rayfa...) Rayfa: Foul beast! You have made a mess of my royal raiment! For that, I shall make a leather coat out of you later! Phoenix: What was that about treating them with \"kindness and respect\" again...? Produce cart Rayfa: Why, this giah'pam looks positively delicious. I think I shall take this one. Phoenix: Y-Your Benevolence! You can't just take things without paying! Rayfa: Shopkeeper! You will receive your payment from this barb-headed foreigner. Lady: Thank you, barb-headed foreigner. Phoenix: Peasants paying for princesses? This place is absolutely feudal. Poster Phoenix: (It's a poster... That's the Plumed Punisher, Khura'in's famous action hero. I guess we're not the only country with superheroes like that.) Steaming buns Rayfa: ........................ *groooowl*... Phoenix: ...Was that your stomach? Rayfa: N-No! Th-That was not me! *groooowl*... Rayfa: Th-That... was the cry of the warbaa'd! Phoenix: Would you like a magatah'man? Rayfa: Enough! I am not hungry! Phoenix: (Why can't some people just admit when they're hungry?) May 11Plaza of Devotion Phoenix: Looks like the police already finished their investigation. (To think someone would be killed here --  a place devoted to prayer. A body outline and... flowers? Did someone leave them here in memory of the deceased? Hm? And there's something different about the prayer flags today...) Rayfa: As the high priest's disciple, Acolyte Zeh'lot was utterly devoted to his training. First the high priest, and now his devoted disciple... Maya Fey will pay for this! Phoenix: As I keep trying to tell you, Maya has nothing to do with any of this! Rayfa: And you can prove this... how?! Phoenix: What do you think I'm doing here?! Gathering dirt and dust for the trial?! Rayfa: You and your smart mouth! This is precisely why you and your lawyerly ilk are so reviled. ???: Hey, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ema! Rayfa: It's that detective from your country again... Ema: Eep, it's the princess! Rayfa: You seem displeased that I am here. Ema: Oh, n-no, no! Don't be silly! Mr. Wright? I'm, uhh... I'm so sorry about what happened to Maya. Phoenix: It's not your fault, Ema. You were just doing your job. And if I had just done mine... Ema: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: ...But it's no use crying over spilled milk! Would you mind telling me what you know about the murder? It's do or die in court tomorrow. And I mean that literally. Ema: Gladly. I'll help in any way I can! Rayfa: Remember, I have my eyes on the both of you, so see to it that you commit no misdeeds. Ema: Of course not! Hmph, you're talking to a professional here. Examine Body outline Phoenix: Acolyte Zeh'lot died bent over in prayer. There's no trace of blood on the ground, though... The fact that there's so little bleeding could mean it was a single stab to a vital point. ...Not that that would've been very difficult, considering the position he was in. Prayer rug Phoenix: Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed in a prayer pose. With his head bent over like that, the last thing he saw must've been this rug. Rayfa: It is a prayer rug woven by devout monks. May the Holy Mother's blessing be upon his departed soul. Phoenix: It's strange that there are no bloodstains, though... Rayfa: Hmm... Perhaps it was so cold, his blood froze. Or perhaps it was absorbed by his vestment. Phoenix: (It IS pretty cold. Maybe the blood really did just freeze inside his body.) Flowers Phoenix: So these flowers were left here in memory of Acolyte Zeh'lot? What are they called? Rayfa: They are known as nahmanda, and they are given to express sorrow when a life is lost. Phoenix: It seems offering flowers in memory of the dead is a universal practice. Nahmanda Flower added to the Court Record. Flowers (subsequent times) Phoenix: So these flowers were left here in memory of Acolyte Zeh'lot? What are they called? Rayfa: They are known as nahmanda, and they are given to express sorrow when a life is lost. Phoenix: It seems offering flowers in memory of the dead is a universal practice. Purple prayer flag Phoenix: This prayer flag looks much newer than the rest. Umm, Your Benevolence? What does it say here? Rayfa: The dearest wishes of our subjects are written upon these prayer flags. Reading the prayers of others is considered rude, but if you must know... ...it says, \"At the usual spot. Bring grub. The key, too.\" Hmm, that is one of the more direct and practical prayers I have ever seen. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it's even a prayer. Brand New Flag added to the Court Record. Purple prayer flag (subsequent times) Phoenix: This prayer flag looks much newer than the rest. Umm, Your Benevolence? What does it say here? Rayfa: The dearest wishes of our subjects are written upon these prayer flags. Reading the prayers of others is considered rude, but if you must know... ...it says, \"At the usual spot. Bring grub. The key, too.\" Hmm, that is one of the more direct and practical prayers I have ever seen. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it's even a prayer. Talk The incident Phoenix: Let's see... How about starting with an overview of what happened. Ema: Sure. The victim is Puhray Zeh'lot. He was the high priest's disciple. His body was discovered around noon today... ...right after the rite wrapped up. Phoenix: So, during the high priest's murder trial. Ema: That's right. Apparently, he had been here praying since the day before the rite even started. Talk about serious devotion. Phoenix: (Yeah... I barely lasted a few minutes.) Ema: This is a picture of Mr. Zeh'lot's body. Phoenix: (That dagger in his upper back looks like it would've been particularly painful. Hm? Is that a tattoo on the back of his neck? It's... peach shaped...?) Ema: Everyone started leaving when the praying was finally done... ...but the victim remained bent over in prayer. And when they went over to check on him... Phoenix: They discovered he was dead, right? Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) added to the Court Record. Ema: Yes. The estimated time of death is May 9, sometime between... ...the start of the rite and the discovery of the high priest's body. In other words, we believe the crime took place during the Purification Rite. And the murder weapon was the same ceremonial dagger that killed the high priest. The prosecution believes Maya came down the stairs after killing the high priest... ...and then stabbed Mr. Zeh'lot with the same dagger. Phoenix: (Circumstantial evidence does point to Maya, but...) What about the cause of death? Ema: He apparently died instantly from the dagger that was left thrust into his upper back. Here's the autopsy report. Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Rayfa: Estimated time of death, you say? How can you know such a thing? I want to know! ...Well, Barbed Head! Out with it! Ema: Oh, so the princess of the spirit medium kingdom is interested in forensic science? Rayfa: Hmph! I have no interest is science, forensic or otherwise! Nevertheless, I will someday be queen. As such, it would be wise to know what silly things the common folk believe in. Ema: Tsk! There's nothing silly about it! I'll have you know, even Prosecutor Sahdmadhi holds forensics in high regard. Rayfa: Does he?! Hmm... Perhaps I should not underestimate the power of science. Still, I suppose it is nothing much compared to the Divination S\u00e9ance. Ema: She really doesn't have an adorable bone in her body. Phoenix: Ema, I think she's actually interested. Would you mind explaining it to her? Ema: ...I guess I have to now. ...Okay, there are many ways to estimate the time of death... ...but the most well-known method uses the change in body temperature. Rayfa: Interesting... Ema: Body temperature drops at a steady rate from the moment a person dies. That means we can tell how long someone's been dead by measuring their temperature. Rayfa: Hmm... I see, I see! That was quite enlightening. Barbed Head! Present your forehead now! Phoenix: What? Why? Rayfa: Hmm... You feel just a little over ninety-five degrees. It seems you are not dead yet. Phoenix: Of course I'm not! Rayfa: Heh heh. It was but a jest. After all, you're still the dead lawyer walking. Phoenix: (I fail to see the humor in any of this.) Were there any witnesses? With so many people here at the plaza, you'd think somebody would've seen something. Ema: You'd think so, wouldn't you? But we haven't found a single witness. Phoenix: How's that even possible?! Rayfa: Because everyone was bent over, utterly devoted to prayer, naturally. Phoenix: Oh, right, the back-shattering pose that nearly killed me. Still, you'd think someone would've noticed something. Ema: I thought so too, but... ...with the monk's scarf he had on, no one could see the dagger in his upper back. Plus, everyone was so absorbed in prayer, they didn't see or hear anything. Phoenix: I can't believe this. Rayfa: What you choose to believe is your choice, but the fact remains there were no witnesses. However, there is one piece of irrefutable evidence. ...The dagger. Ema: Sadly, yes... Phoenix: Argh... The incident (subsequent times) Phoenix: Let's see... How about starting with an overview of what happened. Ema: Sure. The victim is Puhray Zeh'lot. He was the high priest's disciple. His body was discovered around noon today... ...right after the rite wrapped up. Phoenix: So, during the high priest's murder trial. Ema: That's right.

Phoenix: I can't believe this. Rayfa: What you choose to believe is your choice, but the fact remains there were no witnesses. However, there is one piece of irrefutable evidence. ...The dagger. Ema: Sadly, yes... Phoenix: Argh... Murder weapon (appears after \"The incident\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about the murder weapon? Ema: The killer used the Warbaa'd Dagger, the legendary weapon of Lady Kee'ra. It was discovered impaled in the victim's upper back. Rayfa: The accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger, were they not? Ema: Y-Yes, they were. Warbaa'd Dagger added to the Court Record. Rayfa: With such irrefutable evidence, there is no questioning the accused's guilt. Phoenix: Not so fast. What about a motive? Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot. Rayfa: What do the police think about this matter? Murder weapon (subsequent times) Phoenix: Could you tell me about the murder weapon? Ema: The killer used the Warbaa'd Dagger, the legendary weapon of Lady Kee'ra. It was discovered impaled in the victim's upper back. Rayfa: The accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger, were they not? Ema: Y-Yes, they were. Rayfa: With such irrefutable evidence, there is no questioning the accused's guilt. Phoenix: Not so fast. What about a motive? Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot. Rayfa: What do the police think about this matter? Motive (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot! Rayfa: So you say, but let us now hear what the police think about the matter. Ema: The police believe Maya is the Lady Kee'ra figure who has been battling the rebels. And since Mr. Zeh'lot was the disciple of the high priest, who turned out to be a rebel... Rayfa: He, too, was likely a rebel, and therefore met the same untimely demise as his teacher. Ema: ...Yes, that is how the police currently view this crime. Phoenix: There's no way Maya is that Lady Kee'ra vigilante! Ema: I agree on a personal level, but the police are just going with what today's trial concluded. Phoenix: Ngrk! (I really blew it in court today.) Present Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report Ema: Based on the estimated time of death, we believe he was killed during the rite itself. It appears he was stabbed in the upper back with a dagger and died instantly. Phoenix: But there were so many people here. How could no one have noticed? Ema: I know. I can't believe it, either. I guess they were just that focused on their prayers or something. Warbaa'd Dagger Ema: Maya's fingerprints were found on the dagger that was used in the murder. The police are, therefore, investigating her as their prime suspect. Rayfa: The evidence is irrefutable, with no room for argument. Ema: I really don't want to treat Maya as a suspect, but... ...based on the evidence and police reports I've received so far, it's not looking good. Phoenix: (Not good? More like, how could it get any worse?) After clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag: Phoenix: Okay... That message on the prayer flag seems a little weird, but... Before clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House Phoenix: ...I think I've seen everything there is to see around here. Rayfa: You have not found or heard anything of particular worth. Are you ready to give up? Phoenix: No, I'm not calling it quits yet! Ema: ...D-Does it look like you have any hope of winning, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ema... I can't really say at this point. All I know is I have to keep investigating. Rayfa: What are you two sneaks up to? I would advise you to get back to work if you are done here, Detective. Otherwise, I will report you to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi for dereliction of duty. Ema: I-I-I, I'm going, I'm going! Well, see you later, Mr. Wright. And good luck! Phoenix: (I should really pay a visit to everyone and every place connected with this case.) After clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House Phoenix: ...I'm not sure it's related to this case. Rayfa: We have paid a visit to all of the people and places connected with this case. I think it is about time you prepared yourself for the inevitable. Don't you? Ema: ...D-Does it look like you have any hope of winning, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ema... I can't really say at this point. All I know is I have to keep investigating. Rayfa: What are you two sneaks up to? I would advise you to get back to work if you are done here, Detective. Otherwise, I will report you to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi for dereliction of duty. Ema: I-I-I, I'm going, I'm going! Well, see you later, Mr. Wright. And good luck! Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Is it not time to give up? Phoenix: No, there is still someone I need to talk to first. May 11High Priest's House Phoenix: Hello. I'm sorry to bother you again, but... Beh'leeb: Oh, it's you. Rayfa: Barbed Head! You are not contemplating casting suspicion upon Lady Beh'leeb, are you? She lost her beloved husband, and now Acolyte Zeh'lot, who was like a son to her. Phoenix: Of course, I'm not. But since she was close to both victims, I wanted to hear what she has to say. Rayfa: ...Very well. Phoenix: (And then there's the fact that Lady Kee'ra didn't attack Mrs. Inmee. That probably means she isn't a rebel.) Beh'leeb: Is this about poor Puhray? Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think I can talk about that right now. Phoenix: ...B-But what about Maya? She's innocent. Beh'leeb: Maya? I heard she was found guilty. First, my dear husband, and now Puhray? Phoenix: Mrs. Inmee, you don't really believe that Maya is the killer, do you? Beh'leeb: I-I... I don't know. But that was the verdict, so what else can I believe? What am I to do? Phoenix: The verdict was already reached in your husband's case... ...but the truth of the matter is yet to be found! Beh'leeb: How can you be so sure? Phoenix: ...Because I believe that Maya is innocent. That is all I have right now -- my faith in her. So please. Help me understand what happened. Beh'leeb: So you're... you're defending her based solely on faith? Even though you'll be punished for abetting the accused? Phoenix: That's right. Beh'leeb: ...A-All right, then. Your faith has moved me. I will tell you what I can. Rayfa: A-Are you sure about this, Lady Beh'leeb? Beh'leeb: \"My lovely wife is also a devout follower of Khura'inism. As such, she is not one to make light of another's faith. But if I find that you have lied about your faith in Maya Fey's innocence... ...I shall curse your entire family and all your disciples for the next eight generations.\" Phoenix: (Hey! Leave Athena and Apollo alone, buddy!) Examine Photo frame near TV Phoenix: A photo of the high priest, his wife, Acolyte Zeh'lot, and Maya... Since Maya's in it... ...it must've been taken the day before the rite. I should ask Mrs. Inmee about it. Family Photo added to the Court Record. Rayfa: To think that this would be their final family photo... That no-good Maya Fey has some nerve. I mean, here she is posing with the two men whom she would soon kill. Phoenix: I beg to differ. I see this photo as proof that she didn't kill them. Rayfa: Hmph. That smile of hers does not fool me. I sense a deep and abiding malice behind it. Phoenix: (I'll prove Maya's smile is the real deal!) Photo frame near TV (subsequent times, before presenting Family Photo) Phoenix: A photo of the high priest, his wife, Acolyte Zeh'lot, and Maya...

Photo frame near TV (after presenting Family Photo) Phoenix: It's that family photo they took. Mrs. Inmee said it was taken the day before the rite. I don't suppose any of them could've possibly imagined what was to come... Talk Puhray Zeh'lot Phoenix: How did Acolyte Zeh'lot end up living here as your husband's disciple? Beh'leeb: About two years ago, while my husband was at a spiritual retreat in the mountains... ...he came across Puhray collapsed on the ground. That's when he brought him here. You were always one to help those in need, weren't you, dear? Phoenix: ...And he'd been living here ever since? (About two years ago... That's around the same time Maya arrived in Khura'in.) Beh'leeb: Yes, he was born in a poor village and had nowhere to call home. My husband felt pity for the boy, so he took him in as his disciple. ...But not only as his disciple. He was like a member of our family, too. Phoenix: I see. (If this is where Acolyte Zeh'lot lived... ...there might be something I could learn about him lying around here.) The day before (appears after presenting Family Photo) Beh'leeb: This photo was taken during the Feast of Blessings. Phoenix: The Feast of Blessings? Beh'leeb: Yes. It is forbidden to eat during the days of the rite, so the day before it's performed... ...we enjoyed dishes full of gingihl, an herb known to strengthen the body and mind. You loved the gingihl-based dishes I make, didn't you, dear? Phoenix: Gingihl... I heard you can go three days without sleeping after eating some. Beh'leeb: Yes, but many foreigners don't care for it because of its strong smell. Our customs say that these dishes can only be eaten the day before the Purification Rite... ...and only between noon and 3 PM. Phoenix: That's pretty specific. Is it because the smell is too strong? Beh'leeb: A very good guess, indeed. It is to ensure the smell is gone by the time Lady Kee'ra is welcomed the next day. Phoenix: Wow, is it really that strong? (Come to think of it, the evening before the murder... ...an overwhelming odor was all over town. It was like a cross between garlic and mint.) Beh'leeb: After the Feast of Blessings, Puhray went over to the plaza to begin his supplication. I never thought that would be the last time I would see him. Phoenix: What was Maya doing at the time? Beh'leeb: Shortly after Puhray left, she went to the temple to prepare for the rite. ...I don't know what she did after that. Beh'leeb's Statement added to the Court Record. Phoenix: So, Acolyte Zeh'lot went out to pray the afternoon before the rite? (According to the newspaper... ...on the day before the rite, the plaza was so cold, the whole place had iced over.) Beh'leeb: Puhray always prayed a lot -- far more than anyone I have ever known. He was a devout young man whose faith was twice as strong as others. Phoenix: (I don't know why, but that's... kinda intimidating to me...) The day before (subsequent times) Beh'leeb: This photo was taken during the Feast of Blessings. Phoenix: The Feast of Blessings?

He has joined my husband in the Twilight Realm. He was so full of life before he went out to the plaza. Rayfa: This must be most difficult for you. It is like losing a family member. Beh'leeb: What's that, dear? ...Yes, you're right. I don't know what would've become of me if my husband were not here by my side. Phoenix: Umm... Is there anything you can tell me about Acolyte Zeh'lot that might help? Rayfa: He was a kindly young man. Let us leave it at that. Family Photo Phoenix: Can I ask you about this photo? Beh'leeb: It was taken during the Feast of Blessings, the day before the rite was held. Phoenix: The Feast of Blessings? Would you mind telling me a little more about it? After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: (I thought I'd have made some progress by now. But I haven't come across any particularly insightful information, even here.) Rayfa: You seem disappointed. Phoenix: Mrs. Inmee, is there anything else you could tell me? Beh'leeb: Forgive me. But if I keep thinking about those two any longer... Rayfa: Barbed Head... Phoenix: Yes, I understand. Thank you for your help. I'm sorry to have troubled you.

I think it is about time you prepared yourself for the inevitable. Don't you? Tehm'pul Temple Present Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report Rayfa: Ah, the second murder victim. Phoenix: Did you know Acolyte Zeh'lot, too, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: I knew of him. I know he had been living under the care of Abbot Inmee at his home, but little else. Phoenix: You mean like how they're letting me stay at the temple? Rayfa: Are you seriously trying to insult the poor victim with your comparison, you filthy dog? Phoenix: (Hey! What was THAT comparison for?!) Warbaa'd Dagger Rayfa: That is the sacred dagger used in the Purification Rite. In using it for murder, the vile criminal known as Maya Fey shall be cursed for all eternity. Phoenix: Nothing's been proven yet, so stop treating her like a criminal! Rayfa: How do explain the accused's fingerprints all over the dagger, then? And the fact that Abbot Inmee was slain with this very weapon? Phoenix: (I-I hate it when I have no comeback...!) After clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag in Plaza of Devotion and clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House: May 11Detention Center Maya: ............... Phoenix: (Maya sure looks tired.) I'm so sorry, Maya. I failed to defend you during that trial earlier today. Maya: I'm sorry, too, Nick. I never meant to get caught up in this whole mess. Even worse, I got you caught up in it, too, and you were convicted under that stupid law. Nick... You should really withdraw from this case. Maybe they'll even commute your sentence if you do! Phoenix: I-I could never abandon you like that! You might not believe me, but I'm going to pull off a win somehow. Maya: It's not like I don't believe in you, it's just... Phoenix: Don't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside out and upside down! You'll see! Maya: O-Okay... Rayfa: ..................... Phoenix: You're awfully quiet, Your Benevolence. Rayfa: It is only a matter of time until your executions are carried out. I simply thought I would allow you two a good talk before you depart from this world. Phoenix: Sorry, but we're not giving up yet. And we won't till the bitter end. Rayfa: There is no need to put on a brave face. Your fates were sealed with today's verdict. Worry not of Maya Fey. The Twilight Realm will cleanse the taint from that neophyte practitioner's soul. Then, perhaps, the Holy Mother may finally forgive her. Maya: ............... Phoenix: (Wait... Was that her attempt at comforting me?) Rayfa: Barbed Head, further resistance shall come to naught. Stop your desperate struggle. Accept the judgment that has been passed upon you. Phoenix: (She obviously doesn't know me very well.) Rayfa: Then, perhaps, your sentence will be commuted, and-- Maya: Hold it right there, Your Benevolence. Why do you always have to be like that? Phoenix: M-Maya, what are you... Rayfa: Wh-What is the matter? I was simply showing some mercy upon your souls. Maya: Nick here is risking his life to defend me. Rayfa: And that is why I told you it will come to nau-- Maya: No, it won't! Nick is just doing what lawyers are supposed to! He's defending his client, no matter what! Rayfa: Enough! There is no place for lawyers in the Hall of Justice! For we have the Divination S\u00e9ance! Maya: But your Insights were wrong! Rayfa: Nnngrrrr... Phoenix: (Ooh boy, that's gotta hurt.) Maya: Don't you get it? Errors are bound to happen if your Insights are accepted without question. So I ask you, royal priestess: What is your true duty? Do the victims' souls or the Holy Mother herself wish you to judge people in error? Rayfa: Oooooh... You dare bring Her Holiness's name into this?! You know nothing, you... you... phony baloney! Phoenix: P-Please, you two! Enough already! Maya: S-Sorry, Nick. I got a little carried away. That's not really like me, huh? Aha ha ha. Phoenix: No, I should be thanking you, Maya. It's good to have you in my corner. Rayfa: Hrrnh... How dare you mock me so! You will not get away with this! I was a fool to show you compassion. And to think I could convince you to accept your fate. So struggle all you want in the Hall of Justice tomorrow. You will receive your just desserts, as the scorn of our kingdom is heaped upon you! Phoenix: (...I can see straight through that contorted smile on your face, you know. *sigh* She may say these terrible things... ...but it's just the way she was raised, I guess.) Examine Bell Maya: A guard will come running if you ring that bell there. Phoenix: Really? Let's put that to the test, shall we? *jingle, jingle* Maya: Oh, but they got really mad last time when I rang it for no reason. Phoenix: You could've told me that before I rang it! Talk Zeh'lot's murder Phoenix: Could you try to remember what happened one more time? Maya: I've been trying as hard as I can... But I can't remember anything from the middle of the rite onward. Phoenix: Oh, right. You suddenly felt sleepy, and everything after that's a blank. Maya: Even so, I didn't kill anyone! And I'm not the one going around dressed like Lady Kee'ra! ...Although it's kind of cool to think there's a mysterious female vigilante out there. Phoenix: R-Right... Puhray Zeh'lot Phoenix: Were you close to Acolyte Zeh'lot? Maya: Umm... We met several times during the meetings about the rite. But I didn't know him very well. He seemed pretty quiet. Phoenix: Didn't you eat together the day before the rite? Maya: Yeah! We ate this one super-stinky dish, but it was actually really good! I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it was love at first bite! Like... You know the salty noodles at Eldoon's Noodles? It's like if you added garlic and herbs to that, and then let it simmer for a really long time. Phoenix: (Sounds more like a hot pot than ramen to me at that point...) Maya: *sigh* Now I miss ramen, too... Phoenix: Umm... so what was Acolyte Zeh'lot like while you were eating? Maya: ...He seemed to be enjoying the food. But as soon as we were done, he left to go pray. Phoenix: And what did you do? Maya: Oh, umm... I returned to the temple to prepare for the rite. Phoenix: (That coincides with Mrs. Inmee's description of events.) Lady Kee'ra's identity (appears after \"Puhray Zeh'lot\") Phoenix: Any idea who might be pretending to be Lady Kee'ra? Maya: Hmm... When the rite started, it was just me and Abbot Inmee. Phoenix: But the S\u00e9ance vision showed a third figure who looked like Lady Kee'ra. Maya: I know... *sigh* Lady Kee'ra... I wish I could've seen her in the flesh. Phoenix: Umm, yeah... (Let's stay focused on the case, shall we?) It was supposed to have been impossible for a third party to enter the Inner Sanctum. Maya: Ah! But what if she came from the sky? You know, like that bushy-bearded paratrooper! That mountain would've been no match for Lady Kee'ra's wings! Phoenix: That's from the Plumed Punisher TV show, right? Maya: H-How'd you know? Phoenix: Because the real Lady Kee'ra doesn't have wings. Maya: Ooh! I've got it this time! There must be a secret room with a secret door at the Inner Sanctum! Did you know there are eighty-eight secret Plumed Punisher bases here in Khura'in? Phoenix: Can we please stop talking about the Plumed Punisher show for a sec, Maya? Maya: I guess so. *sigh* Keeping it real is much harder than it looks. Present Plumed Punisher Strap Maya: It's my Plumed Punisher strap! There's only one of them in the entire world! I'll treasure it for the rest of my life! Phoenix: .........Your Benevolence? I can't help but notice how hard you're staring at this strap. Rayfa: M-Me?! Want that?! Sorry, but you are sorely mistaken! Maya: Hey, Your Benevolence? Would you let me out of here in exchange for the strap? Rayfa: ....................................... ...What a preposterous idea! Phoenix: (It didn't stop you from entertaining it, though, did it?) Lady Kee'ra's Warning Maya: Nick, I'm not the one going around impersonating Lady Kee'ra. Phoenix: I know, Maya. I believe you. Rayfa: Oh, please. Dispense with this bungling act. Phoenix: I'm going to prove that Maya isn't Lady Kee'ra. Rayfa: Why bother? She is already as good as guilty. And floundering about will not change that fact. Phoenix: I don't care. I'll keep fighting until the very last crack of His Magistry's gavel! Rayfa: Hmph. You truly are...a nincompoop. Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report Maya: First Abbot Inmee, and now Acolyte Zeh'lot... Rayfa: Spare me your crocodile tears. We both know it was YOU who slew those pious men! Maya: N-No, it wasn't me! Nick... How can we make her understand? Phoenix: Probably only by getting to the bottom of things in court tomorrow... Warbaa'd Dagger Maya: I can't believe the sacred dagger was used in a murder. Rayfa: Only a truly irreverent individual would dare do such a thing. And it was your fingerprints that were found upon the weapon. How do you explain that? Maya: I used the dagger during our rehearsals! That's why it has my fingerprints on it. Rayfa: And how do I know you are not lying? Maya: Ugh... Why won't you believe me? Phoenix: Just let it go, Maya. There's no changing her mind right now... Family Photo Maya: We took this picture during the Feast of Blessings... ...before all of these unthinkably tragic things happened... Rayfa: Unthinkable? I doubt that. You were surely plotting your murderous rampage at the time. Maya: I was thinking of nothing of the sort -- especially not during that meal! The smell of gingihl was so strong, I couldn't think of anything else. Rayfa: Yes, well, it IS a rather intense aroma... Phoenix: (Wow... Do I even want to know how strong of a smell gingihl gives off up close...?) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Well, I should get going now. Maya: ...Sorry I wasn't any help. Phoenix: Don't worry. I've got this. We'll beat the charges tomorrow and be on the first plane back home before you know it. Then we'll go grab dinner at Eldoon's, or your favorite burger joint! You pick! Maya: ...Sounds good! I think I'll get the extra-large Hamburg steak topping on my salty bowl! Best of both worlds! Phoenix: You can have whatever you like! (But first, I have to beat the charges.) Maya: Ah! I almost forgot! Phoenix: Ack! Wh-What is it? Maya: I have a favor to ask. Phoenix: Okay... But why are we whispering? Maya: I forgot I left something at the high priest's house. It's super important! Would you mind getting and holding on to it for me? Phoenix: Sure. So what's this super important thing? Maya: In my bag, you'll find a folding book. It's only given to the priestess who performs the rite. It's called the Tome of Secrets. Phoenix: That does sound important. How could you leave something like that just lying around? (That explains all the whispering. If Rayfa found out, all heck would break loose.) Maya: Look, it's got Lady Kee'ra's real name written in it, so... Oops! Don't tell anyone I told you that! In fact, just forget I said anything at all! It's supposed to be a secret! Phoenix: The Tome of Secrets contains... secrets? Imagine that. Rayfa: Hm? What are you two whispering about? Phoenix: Oh, um, n-nothing. It's just she forgot something, so I told her I'd go get it. Rayfa: ...You are up to something, I just know it. Maya: Thanks, Nick! I'm counting on you! Tehm'pul Temple, Plaza of Devotion, Inner Sanctum, Detention Center, or Bazaar Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: So, are you ready to give up, Barbed Head? Any more of this and you will cause Lady Inmee to suffer more than she already is. Phoenix: I understand what you mean, but I can't give up that easily. After all, I have to defend Maya in court. Rayfa: Stubborn fool. ...But you have already been found guilty. If you wish to continue floundering about, I suppose now is your last chance. Phoenix: I'll take every chance I can get. What to do Rayfa: What? Have you given up already? Phoenix: Not even close! Still, it does feel like I'm barely treading water over here. Rayfa: Water? Do all the people of your country go for a swim when they are troubled? If so, seek the rivers on the edge of town. There you will find all the water you need. Go ahead, paddle to your heart's content! Phoenix: (English idioms go right over her head.) May 11High Priest's House Phoenix: Hello? Anybody home? No answer... Mrs. Inmee's probably out right now. Well, I'll just get what I came for. Rayfa: I am watching you like a warbaa'd, Barbed Head! You had better not steal anything! Phoenix: I would never do something like that! I'm just here to get what Maya asked for! Rayfa: Then get on with it. Phoenix: I would if you'd stop interrupting me... Examine Handbag Leads to: \"Ah, here's Maya's bag.\" Phoenix: (Ah, here's Maya's bag.) Rayfa: Hm? What is that strange patch on her bag? Phoenix: It's the Steel Samurai. He's the hero of an action-hero show back in my country. It's actually Maya's favorite show. She's got all sorts of merchandise related to it. Rayfa: I see... He looks strikingly similar to the Plumed Punisher. Phoenix: They are similar, but... (...the Steel Samurai definitely came first.) Rayfa: I see... How interesting... Phoenix: (Rayfa seems genuinely intrigued. There must a common thread between Plumed Punisher and Steel Samurai fans. Come to think of it... ...didn't Maya mention something about trading with a Plumed Punisher fan? But I digress... I'd better find what she asked me to look for and get going.) Let's see here... This must be that Tome of Secrets that Maya was talking about. Tome of Secrets added to the Court Record. Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Are you finished now? Phoenix: Hold on a second. The string around it is coming undone... Whoops! Oh...! Rayfa: AHHHHH! YOU FOOL! Do not lay eyes upon it! Put it away! Quickly! Before we go blind! Phoenix: Relax. My hand just slipped. Rayfa: This is the Tome of Secrets! Are you trying to get us cursed?! Lady Kee'ra is liable to swoop down and gouge our eyes out! Phoenix: Oh, right. This book is related to Lady Kee'ra, isn't it? Your Benevolence, would you mind if I asked you some questions? Rayfa: Hmph... Examine Handbag Rayfa: What is that strange patch on her bag again? Phoenix: It's for the Steel Samurai, this action hero back in my country. Rayfa: It looks so similar to the Plumed Punisher -- strikingly so. Hmm, I see... \"The Steel Samurai\"... Phoenix: You're actually interested in it, aren't you? Rayfa: Wh-Whatever gave you that idea?! Move Rayfa: Where do you think you are going, Barbed Head? Were you not the one who said you wished to speak with me? Phoenix: (I better stay here and talk to Rayfa for now.) Talk Tome of Secrets Rayfa: This is not something I would normally speak about to an outsider such as you. Phoenix: Well, can't you make an exception?! Rayfa: If you insist... Nayna! What of this folding book? ...Yes, I see... This very important tome is bestowed upon the priestess in the Purification Rite. Phoenix: *gulp* Very important? Wh-What's written inside? Rayfa: Yes, yes... Yes, I see... ...Really? Is it all right to reveal that? Phoenix: ...Um, uhhh... Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Patience, patience! The book contains Lady Kee'ra's true name. Phoenix: Her true name? Is a name really that important of a secret? Rayfa: To a Khura'inist priestess, a person's name is one of the most important things to know. Lady Kee'ra's real name (appears after \"Tome of Secrets\") Phoenix: What's so important about a name? Rayfa: Without a name, a priestess's voice will fail to reach a person's mitamah. It is much like trying to send a letter without the recipient's address. A spirit can only be identified once you know the deceased's face and name. Phoenix: Oh, I get it. It's like when you see someone in a crowd you recognize, but you don't know their name. It makes it impossible to get their attention. Rayfa: Indeed. You must know a spirit's face and true name before you can commune with it. It is the same for Khura'inism's most secret art, one that my mother alone may use. Phoenix: The queen has a secret art? Rayfa: Hmph, it is something a foreigner such as you could never hope to guess. Maya: In Khura'inism, spirit channeling is a secret art that can only be performed by the queen. No one else is supposed to be able to do it. Phoenix: (I should pretend this is all new to me. Besides, I get the feeling she secretly really wants to tell me all about it.) The queen's secret art (appears after \"Lady Kee'ra's real name\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about this secret art of the queen you spoke of? Rayfa: Come again? Phoenix: Oh, sorry. Maybe we shouldn't talk about this. It IS a secret after all, right? Rayfa: It is the secret art of spirit channeling. But I suppose those words are meaningless to you. Phoenix: I'm just surprised how willing you are to tell me about it. Rayfa: A third-rate lawyer could not channel spirits simply by learning of the technique. Phoenix: (Third-rate is a bit harsh. I'd even settle for second.) Rayfa: What is it? You have the look of a tentacled hag frog upon your face. Phoenix: (What the heck is a tentacled hag frog?!) ...Spirit channeling... That's where a medium lets a spirit possess her body to return to our world, right? Rayfa: Well now. I see you have done your homework. Phoenix: Oh, I guess I studied a bit. Eh heh. Rayfa: With the power of spirit channeling, one can bring back even the most ancient of spirits! It is quite a magnificent power, is it not? Phoenix: (I've never seen her eyes light up like this before.) I imagine they're pretty shocked when they come back from ancient times. Rayfa: Indeed. A spirit's memory is cut off at the moment of death. Phoenix: So even a spirit that is brought back after centuries doesn't sense any gap in time... ...between the moment of its death, and the moment it is channeled? Rayfa: Yes, and yet, it clearly recalls all of the memories it had in life. Thus, even heroes and scholars of antiquity can be channeled and directly learned from. Our queens have also used this power to help the rulers of neighboring lands seek counsel. That is why we have never been invaded, and how we have maintained our unique culture. Phoenix: So, spirit channeling is a really effective tool for international politics. Rayfa: It is, indeed. And that is why only those with the power to channel spirits may rule our kingdom. But of late, there has been an endless influx of illegal immigrants from neighboring lands. The fools come seeking the same great power as my mother. Phoenix: Illegal immigrants? Rayfa: Yes. It is becoming quite a problem. Some have lost their way in life, and look to Khura'inism for their salvation. Among them are also those of dubious nature, who have been driven from their own lands. Phoenix: (Dubious nature... Driven from their own land... Gaspen Payne definitely fit that bill. But they sure weren't treating him like an illegal alien.) Rayfa's spiritual power (appears after \"The queen's secret art\") Leads to: \"Can you channel spirits, Your Benevolence?\" Present Tome of Secrets Rayfa: You fool! Why have you put the Tome of Secrets before me?! Phoenix: What's the big deal? Rayfa: S-Stay back! Come no closer! Phoenix: (Hey, this thing's actually pretty useful!) Lookie here, Your Benevolence. It's the Tome of Seeecrets. Rayfa: If you do not desist this instant, I shall have you put to death for the crime of blasphemy! Phoenix: Urk! S-Sorry! (...If looks could kill, I'd already be dead.) Phoenix: Can you channel spirits, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: I am but the royal priestess. There is still much that I must learn. As of now, the Divination S\u00e9ance takes me to the very limit of my ability. Phoenix: (So, her spiritual power doesn't measure up to Maya's.) Rayfa: ...You were just mocking me in your mind, weren't you? Phoenix: D-Don't be ridiculous! Rayfa: It is written all over your face! You... impudent nincompoop! The Divination S\u00e9ance was once one of the important roles fulfilled by the queen. That is what my mother taught me when I was little. Phoenix: (So the queen can perform the Dance of Devotion? That'd be a sight to see.) Rayfa: Someday, I will be a powerful priestess and queen, just like my mother. And the Divination S\u00e9ance is a vital part of my training to prepare me for that day! Phoenix: F-Forgive my ignorance, Your Benevolence. Rayfa: Hmph, you shall see. It will not be long before I, too, master the secret art of spirit channeling! I will be a magnificent queen who unites her people for the greater good of Khura'in! Phoenix: (Now I see... Spirit channeling is something she really aspires to.) Maya: I'm going to ace that test and become the next master! After all, I can't let my clan and the other villagers down. Phoenix: (It looks like she actually has something in common with Maya.) Rayfa: Are you quite through now? There are more important things to do than to stand here and talk about spirit channeling. Phoenix: (That's true. It doesn't have anything to do with this case, as far as I can tell. Or does it...?) Umm... If the queen is a spirit medium... Rayfa: Are you about to suggest that my mother was channeling Lady Kee'ra? Phoenix: Ack! (I guess she saw that one coming.) Rayfa: Hmph, lawyers are indeed a witless breed! On the day of the rite, my mother was engaged in other duties at the palace. Phoenix: Of course... Rayfa: My mother is a very busy woman. And the idea itself is preposterous. Do you truly believe the queen of Khura'in would personally battle the insurgents? This is precisely what makes you third-rate! Phoenix: Urk! (Another dead end! This is bad!) A-Anyway, I need to continue looking for leads, so... ???: Over there! After him! Don't let him escape! Rayfa: What is all that racket? What? That escaped prisoner has surfaced here in town? Phoenix: Escaped prisoner? You mean... that guy with the bushy beard? Rayfa: There is no reason to panic. The police are on his trail. Phoenix: (He's no longer a suspect... But he might know something, considering he was at the scene of the crime.) Let's go take a look! Rayfa: Wait! May 11Khura'in - Bazaar Phoenix: *huff* *puff* Oww, my aching back. I forgot how badly I'd injured it. Ow, ow, ow... I need to do some stretching and exercise more when I get back home. ???: Ah, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: *huff* *puff* ...H-Hey, Ahlbi. Datz... Are'bal... Have you seen hi-- Ow, ow, ow! Ahlbi: A-Are you all right, sir? Phoenix: One second... *huff* *puff* *wheeeeeze* Have you seen... that escaped prisoner around here? Ahlbi: Oh, so that's why all those police came rushing over here. I heard them saying something about an escaped prisoner disappearing in this area. Phoenix: He disappeared in this area? He couldn't have taken to the air again, could he? Rayfa: Barbed Head! *huff* *huff* I told you to wait! Phoenix: It's too dangerous for you around here, Your Benevolence. Mr. Are'bal could be lurking nearby! Rayfa: What sort of a princess would I be if all it took was an escaped prisoner to frighten me?! Phoenix: (She's fearless, I'll give her that.) I can't be responsible if something happens to you. (As long as I'm here, though, I might as well search the area myself. Hmm... If I were an escaped prisoner, where would I hide?) Examine Manhole Phoenix: That manhole cover... It's open! Shah'do: Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff! Ahlbi: Whoa! What is it, Shah'do?! Phoenix: Did he sniff out someone or something in the manhole? (Hmm, I wonder...) Could Shah'do track Mr. Are'bal if he had something with the rebel's scent on it? Ahlbi: I-I don't know... Phoenix: (I feel like I've got something with Mr. Are'bal's scent on it... Something he might've touched...) Talk Any ideas? Phoenix: Have you noticed anything around here? Ahlbi: I haven't seen the escaped prisoner. But I did notice how slow you run, sir. Phoenix: (It's just the high elevation. I'm out of breath before I know it!) What to do Ahlbi: The police said the escaped prisoner vanished right around here. Phoenix: Hmm, there aren't any really good hiding places, so where could he have gone? Ahlbi: Maybe he melted into the crowd. Phoenix: You should be careful, Your Benevolence. Rayfa: You need not tell me that! I am not a child, after all! Phoenix: Okay, okay... Present Plumed Punisher Strap Ahlbi: That is THE Plumed Punisher strap. There's only one in the entire world! Phoenix: Oh, do you know a lot about the Plumed Punisher? Ahlbi: Of course! She's a real hero to the people! Phoenix: The ratings for the show must be through the roof. Ahlbi: They are! It reached 100 percent viewership at one point! Phoenix: One hundred percent?! Ahlbi: Well, when there's only one TV channel in the entire kingdom... Phoenix: Oh, that explains it. Warbaa'd Dagger Ahlbi: That's the dagger that was used in the rite. It's said that Lady Kee'ra once wielded it. In addition to that dagger, there are many other items that are said to have been hers. Phoenix: Really? Like what? Ahlbi: There's the obvious stuff, like swords, spears, and other weapons. But there are other, more interesting items, like her favorite hat and her favorite pillow. Phoenix: Her pillow...? Ahlbi: Yes. They say if you use it, Lady Kee'ra will ensure you have a restful slumber. Phoenix: As long as it's not eternal... Brand New Flag (after examining manhole) Leads to: \"Here, Shah'do. How about this?\" Phoenix: Here, Shah'do. How about this? I hope it works... Shah'do: Grrr... Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff! Phoenix: I think he's picked up a scent! You mind if I borrow Shah'do for a bit?! Ahlbi: By all means! I had no idea you could do this! Yeah! Go get 'im, boy! Shah'do: Ruff, ruff, ruff! Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I'm heading down the manhole now. It could be dangerous, so please wait here! Rayfa: Wait! Phoenix: Don't worry, I won't commit any of those misdeeds you're so worried about. Rayfa: That is not what I fear! There may be a vicious insurgent lurking down there! Phoenix: Oh, are you worried about me? Rayfa: No. I was simply wondering why you would go to such lengths in your investigation. After all, if you would simply withdraw from this case, they might commute your sentence. Phoenix: I'm doing this to prove Maya innocent. Rayfa: But how can you be so sure of the accused's innocence?! She has already been found guilty! Phoenix: Don't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside out and upside down! You'll see! Maya: O-Okay... Phoenix: I believe in her. If she says she's innocent, then that means she's innocent. Lawyers must trust in their clients to the bitter end. That's just what we do. Rayfa: ......... You... lamebrain. Do what you will! Phoenix: Well, I'm going in! Let's go, Shah'do! Shah'do: Ruff, ruff! Ahlbi: Be careful! Shah'do!: Ruff, ruff! Phoenix: W-Wait! Come back here! It's pitch black down here. I can't see a thing. *WHAM* Phoenix: Aaagh! Phoenix: Ooogh... Owww owww owwww... What happened? I went down into the manhole, and then... ???: Oh, ya finally came to? Phoenix: Ah! (I'd remember that face anywhere! And that dragon symbol on his armband... That's the mark of the rebels! There can be no mistake! It's him -- Datz Are'bal!) YIKES! Datz: Sorry I got a little rough with ya back there. Thought ya were the cops. Why ya making that face? ...Hey, want an apple? Phoenix: (Whew...I thought he was going to kill me.) I-I'll pass on the apple, but thanks. (I don't mind a good apple, but not right now.) What is this place? Datz: This is the office of my brother in arms, Dhurke! But right now, we're using it as a rebel safe house! Phoenix: Wait, back up a sec. What kind of office is this exactly? Datz: A law office, what else?! Phoenix: Really?! Dhurke used to be a lawyer?! Datz: Yep! Just like you! Phoenix: (Khura'in's public enemy number one is an ex-lawyer? Didn't see that coming.) Datz: But I don't suppose I'll be coming 'round here anymore. Phoenix: You won't? Are you planning to flee or something? Datz: It's just... I wanna get outta the rebel business. Tired o' being hounded by the cops and all that. So I came by today to pick up the last o' my stuff. Phoenix: R-Really...? Datz: I'm gonna sell Dhurke's info to the minister o' justice, then slip outta Khura'in! Phoenix: ...W-Wait a second! You're a key person of interest in this case! You can't go running off like that! Datz: Relax, will ya? I'll tell ya whatever ya need to know. Oh, and sorry about punching your lights out back there. My bad! So, Mr. Lawyer Man, whaddaya wanna know? Phoenix: Tell me about the murders of the high priest Tahrust Inmee, and his acolyte Puhray Zeh'lot. Datz: Sure, I'll tell ya whatever I can. Don't know if it'll be much help, though. I mean, I'm not a rebel anymore, so... Phoenix: (I wonder how true that really is...) Examine Picture of Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in Phoenix: (There's a knife driven deep into a photo of the queen. I guess the rebels really hate her. I better remember to stay on their good side.) White flowers Phoenix: Incense and white flowers... (The flowers are still fresh. They must've been put here maybe today or yesterday.) Did you put these here, Mr. Are'bal? Datz: ...Something wrong with flowers? Phoenix: Oh, no! Datz: It's just a traditional thing here in Khura'in. Pay it no mind. Ladder Phoenix: There's a ladder leading underground. He must've brought me in through there. But there's no reason for me to leave yet. I should see what else Mr. Are'bal has to say. Photos Phoenix: This looks like a photo of Dhurke and his compatriots... And here's one that looks really old... Wow, this was taken about twenty years ago. Datz: Those are Dhurke's sons. Phoenix: Really? So this is the rebel Dhurke in the center? He doesn't look so evil. And both of his sons... look kind of familiar... Datz: The one on the left is Yuty. Oh, but you know him as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi is Dhurke's son?! Datz: That he is! Yuty was once a rebel, too! He used to really respect his old man... ...both as a father and as a lawyer. Phoenix: Then why'd he become a prosecutor? Datz: Being a lawyer in this kingdom is the same as signing your own death warrant. Phoenix: On account of the Defense Culpability Act, right? Datz: Yeah. That's why Yuty decided to be a prosecutor instead. He wanted to spark a revolution from the inside, so he dove right into the enemy's den! Phoenix: I would've never guessed it, looking at him now. Datz: You can say that again. Dhurke is battling to change Khura'in's legal system. The will of the dragon spurs him on. We all thought Yuty was taking up the mantle to carry on that will, too... We were sure he'd help overthrow Ga'ran one day, but... As you've seen, he now uses the law to do her bidding. Dhurke's been beside himself. Phoenix: (So he no longer carries the will of the dragon in him, huh... I wonder what happened between father and son for it to come to this?) What about the other child in the photo? Datz: That's Dhurke's adopted son, but he's gone back overseas. His name's Apollo. Phoenix: (Apollo? Wait a second... That bracelet... It really IS Apollo!) Datz: He was a rascal, that one! And his voice could shake the entire room! I imagine he's out there raising high hell somewhere! Phoenix: Ha, aha ha... Yes, I'm sure he's doing just fine. (Considering how far he's come, Mr. Are'bal's description really doesn't do Apollo justice!) Phoenix: ............Apollo! I've been watching you grow over these past two years. That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo. Apollo: ...Thank you! I'll... I'll be fine! Everything will be fine! Phoenix: (He's a responsible young man now. He never lost that loud voice, though.) Photos (subsequent times) Phoenix: This looks like a photo of Dhurke and his compatriots... And here's one that's really old... Datz: Those are Dhurke's sons. The one on the left is Prosecutor Sahdmadhi when he was younger. I used to call him Yuty. Thought he'd carry on the will of the dragon and become a fine lawyer, but... Phoenix: And the other child is...? Datz: That's Dhurke's adopted son, but he's gone back overseas. His name's Apollo. Phoenix: (That name, and that bracelet... Yep, that has to be our Apollo.) Datz: He was a rascal, that one! And his voice could shake the entire room! I imagine he's out there raising high hell somewhere! Phoenix: Ha, aha ha... Yes, I'm sure he's doing just fine. (Considering how far he's come, Mr. Are'bal's description really doesn't do Apollo justice!) Lizards Phoenix: What are these hanging here? Lizards? ...If so, they're pretty big. Datz: Those're sewer lizards! We call 'em that 'cause they live in the sewer! They grow bigger than your average lizard, which makes 'em fine eating! Phoenix: Wait, you eat these? Datz: What else would ya do with 'em?! Here, try one! Phoenix: Pass! I'll definitely pass! Datz: ...You're missing out on a fine treat, my man! Phoenix: S-Somehow, I think I'll live without it. Food on table Phoenix: (There are bowls and platters of food here. ...They're still warm, as if this was all recently prepared.) You must have a pretty big appetite, Mr. Are'bal. Datz: Har har har har har! Guys as big and strong as me... Got even bigger appetites, y'know! Phoenix: But you just fled from the police. I don't know how you could eat this much after all that excitement. Ack! S-Sorry if I offended you! Datz: But first, let's start with an apple-tizer! Phoenix: (Where's he getting all those apples from?!) Datz: Wanna join me, Mr. Lawyer Man? Got plenty of sewer lizards, too! Phoenix: T-Thanks, but I already ate. Coat Phoenix: Is that coat yours, Mr. Are'bal? Datz: Nah, it belongs to the rebel leader Dhurke. Phoenix: It's pretty impressive. I like the color, too. Datz: ...Wanna try it on? Phoenix: Really? You sure it's okay? Datz: Of course. Bet it would look great on ya! Phoenix: Well then, don't mind if I do... ......... Ack! It smells all moldy! Datz: Haaaar har har har har! I can't believe ya fell for it! Haaar haaar! That thing's been hanging there forever! Phoenix: (Note to self: Don't trust this guy ever again.) Sign Phoenix: What's this thing with the dragon on it? Some kind of a sign? Datz: Yep. That was his business sign back when this was Dhurke's office. Phoenix: He used to be a lawyer, right? Datz: That he was, but it was a really long time ago. This place has seen better days, that's for sure. Phoenix: Well, I hope he can put his sign back up someday. Datz: .........I wouldn't hold my breath. TV or refrigerator Phoenix: You guys get electricity? Datz: Yeah, but the power goes out occasionally. Phoenix: That's pretty inconvenient. Datz: You're telling me! Sometimes, it goes out for an entire day. Phoenix: What about the stuff in the refrigerator? Datz: Why don't you see for yourself? Phoenix: Forget I asked! (I'm afraid of what I might find...) Book Phoenix: Is this... a law book? (A dragon mark's been branded into the cover.) Datz: That's Dhurke's law book. Phoenix: Really?! The leader of the rebels? That Dhurke? Datz: That's right. And that \"Mark of the Dragon\" is the emblem of the rebellion! Phoenix: Hmm, the pages in this one section are really dirty. Datz: Must be the section on the Defense Culpability Act. Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record. Phoenix: He must've done a ton of research on the Defense Culpability Act. He practically wore out the entire section. Book (subsequent times) Phoenix: Is this... a law book? (A dragon mark's been branded into the cover.) Datz: That's Dhurke's law book. Phoenix: Really?! The leader of the rebels? That Dhurke? Datz: That's right. And that \"Mark of the Dragon\" is the emblem of the rebellion! Phoenix: Hmm, the pages in this one section are really dirty. Datz: Must be the section on the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: He must've done a ton of research on the Defense Culpability Act. He practically wore out the entire section. Talk The high priest's murder Phoenix: Tell me everything you know about the high priest's murder. Datz: Uhh... Well, as ya know, I don't remember much about that. I banged my head on a rock as soon as I parachuted into the Inner Sanctum. So when I told you I had nothing to do with his murder, I meant it! Phoenix: Okay then, where were you when you came to after banging your head? Datz: Uhh... By the time I came to, it was already dawn. I musta been out cold the whole time! Phoenix: So you didn't see the crime happen at all...? Datz: ...Ya got that right! Phoenix: Then why did you say you did when you testified?! Datz: Oh, uhh... About that... Since I didn't remember a thing... ...I was afraid I'd seem suspicious, so I came up with that whole story! Phoenix: (Does he even realize how much trouble his big fat lie has caused me?) Datz: Sorry for the trouble! It was definitely my bad! Phoenix: (He doesn't seem very sorry to me!) So, the bottom line is you were at the scene of the crime, but weren't involved in it. Got it. Dhurke the attorney (appears after \"The high priest's murder\") Phoenix: So, Dhurke used to be a lawyer? Datz: Yep! He was a force to be reckoned with back when he was still practicing! He was a juggernaut of the law, and as mighty as a dragon! He could strike terror into a prosecutor's heart, just by glaring at him. People called it his \"dragon's glare.\" He even got criminals to confess and pass out with a well-placed glare! Phoenix: (You've got to be kidding me...) Datz: But most important of all, he would never surrender. He'd fight for the accused, no matter how the odds were stacked against him. Phoenix: Is that what you mean by the will of the dragon? Datz: Yep, that would be it! Actually... Your work in court yesterday was mighty impressive, too! You didn't give up, no matter how hard of a beating you took! ...Not unlike Dhurke, I might add! Phoenix: Oh, um... thanks. (Even if a big part of that beating I took was because of you...) Present Anything Datz: Is this a parting gift for me leaving the rebels? Phoenix: N-No, you can't keep it! (I'll just ask him what I can for now.) After clearing \"Dhurke the attorney\" Talk option and examining white flowers, photos, food on table, and book: Datz: Well, I gotta start packing. Who knows when they might catch up with me if I don't scram soon? Phoenix: Please, wait! I still need to ask you something. Datz: Go ahead, shoot. Phoenix: What are you rebels trying to do? Datz: .................. Phoenix: And why were you at the Inner Sanctum in the first place? Talk Mr. Are'bal's plan Phoenix: Why were you at the Inner Sanctum on the day of the murder? Or more precisely, what were you trying to do there? Datz: I was trying to escape from prison, that's all. But that high priest was a fool for getting taken in by Dhurke. He shoulda tried hightailing it outta Khura'in like I'm doing! 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: Ah... Psyche-Locks! (Mr. Are'bal is hiding something! But I won't know exactly what until I can undo the locks!) What exactly are you trying to hide, Mr. Are'bal? Datz: Huh? I'm not hiding anything! No way, no how! Phoenix: (...I'll just have to use my magatama on him, then.) Present Magatama Phoenix: 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Datz's Plan -- Phoenix: I'm going to ask you again: Why were you at the Inner Sanctum on the day of the murder? Or more precisely, what were you trying to do there? Datz: Ya can keep asking, but the answer's still the same. I was trying to escape from prison, that's all. ...But that high priest was a fool. He fell for Dhurke's line and sold his own country out. Phoenix: How can you say such things about him?! He helped you escape, didn't he? Don't you even care about what happened to him? Datz: Nope. I was getting out of the rebellion, anyway. He should've opened his eyes. We never stood a chance against the Ga'ran regime. Phoenix: Hang on. Do you really believe what you're saying? Didn't the high priest's death really hurt you on the inside? Datz: Like I just said, I couldn't care less about the whole thing! Phoenix: I beg to differ. This wouldn't be here in this room if you didn't feel a thing. Present Nahmanda Flower Phoenix: Leads to: \"I heard these flowers are offered in memory of the dead here in Khura'in.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: What does that have to do with anything? Phoenix: You don't know? Try looking deep into your heart. Datz: Umm... I still don't get it. But I'm starting to think you don't, either! Phoenix: (Arngh... Why does it feel so much worse when it's him who's pointing out my failures?) Datz: I told ya, I couldn't care less about the high priest! Phoenix: (Really...? Because I'm pretty sure I have something that points to his grief.) Leads back to: \"I beg to differ. This wouldn't be here in this room if you didn't feel a thing.\" Phoenix: I heard these flowers are offered in memory of the dead here in Khura'in. The high priest's death hit you hard, so you've been grieving here alone, haven't you? Well? Datz: Hee-HO! 1 LOCK BROKEN Datz: Those flowers don't mean anything. It's just a Khura'inese way o' saying goodbye. Phoenix: Why hide the fact that you're mourning his death? Datz: You're reading into this too much. I told ya, I'm done with the rebellion! I haven't even heard from Dhurke or the rest of 'em for a few days. And tomorrow, I'm planning to kiss this kingdom goodbye! Phoenix: No, I know you've been in contact with the other rebels lately! Datz: And how exactly do you plan on proving that?! Phoenix: This piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels! Present Brand New Flag Phoenix: Leads to: \"I found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: ............ Phoenix: Cat got your tongue? Datz: No, it's just, I was shocked at how off-target ya are. Wait, you're not stalling for time or something, are ya? Phoenix: N-No, I'd never do that. (I hope he doesn't think I'm in cahoots with the police or something...) Datz: I keep trying to tell ya -- I got nothing to do with the rebels anymore. Phoenix: (This food was brought here for Mr. Are'bal after he escaped from prison. So he must've gotten in contact with the other rebels somehow.) No, I know you're still involved with them! Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels!\" Phoenix: I found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion. You wrote a message on it, and left it behind for your fellow rebels, didn't you? Datz: Gulp! Phoenix: They brought this food for you at your request. Datz: Hoo-HA HA! Phoenix: So you're lying about leaving the rebels. You're still involved with Dhurke and the rest of them, aren't you? Datz: Naaaaaaaargh! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Are you ready to tell me the truth now? Datz: Oh, you're good, Mr. Lawyer Man! I admit it! I requested the grub. But I was just taking advantage of 'em, that's all! Phoenix: What do you mean? Datz: With my face plastered all over the place, I couldn't stay out in the open anymore. So, I just took advantage of my former comrades for some grub and a place to hide. I was gonna kiss this kingdom goodbye tomorrow! Phoenix: I'm not buying it. You're obviously lying. I can tell just by looking at you. The white-hot flames of revolution definitely still burn on inside of you! Datz: What?! That's ridiculous. Those flames burned out a long time ago! Phoenix: This proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you! Present Dhurke's Law Book Phoenix: Leads to: \"Dhurke's law book? I'm no lawyer, so what's that got to do with me?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: Ah! Phoenix: I'm right, aren't I?! That's why you're so shocked! Datz: Yeesh, I almost forgot about dessert! Phoenix: (I guess that wasn't it.) Datz: Would you give up already? The flames of revolution burned out inside of me a long time ago! Phoenix: (No, I know they still burn on. Because he's wearing something that proves it!) You can't fool me, Mr. Are'bal. Leads back to: \"This proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you!\" Datz: Dhurke's law book? I'm no lawyer, so what's that got to do with me? Phoenix: Look at the mark branded onto the cover. This mark that stands for an unwavering commitment to the revolution. It is Dhurke's way of representing the will of the dragon! Datz: Yeah? So what of it?! Phoenix: You have that same mark on the scarf tied around your left arm. But you wouldn't be wearing that if you were no longer a rebel! Datz: I-I... I forgot to take it off, that's all! Phoenix: No, as a wanted man, that should've been the first thing you took off! The fact that you haven't hidden that mark yet... proves you're still a rebel! Datz: Hoo-HA! 1 LOCK BROKEN Datz: Think whatcha want! But you don't know nothing about me! Phoenix: No, you're wrong. You wear your heart and your beliefs right on your sleeve -- just like me. And this is what I believe in. Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Leads to: \"...............\" Present anything else Phoenix: Datz: That's what you believe in? Phoenix: Sure! And I never waver from it! Datz: That's the lamest belief I ever heard of! Haaaaaar har har har har! Phoenix: (I didn't think it was THAT funny...) Datz: I was right, you don't know a thing about me! Phoenix: Actually, I know you wear your beliefs right on your sleeve -- just like me. Leads back to: \"And this is what I believe in.\" Datz: ............... Phoenix: When a person's back is against a wall, they always fall back on what they believe in. Just as I always have my badge, you always have the will of the dragon with you. Datz: And would you risk your life for your beliefs? Phoenix: ...No, I wouldn't. Datz: No? Phoenix: No, because I wouldn't be much use to my clients dead. Now, admit it! You've never once thought about leaving the Defiant Dragons, have you! Datz: .........That look in your eyes. It's just like Dhurke's. ...Looks like you've got the will of the dragon inside o' ya, too. 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Mr. Are'bal's plan (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Datz: I had planned to take ya out if ya turned out to be on the side of the royals... But I think I can trust ya. Phoenix: (I can't believe I was that close to getting shanked here...) Datz: It's like ya said. I've no intention of leaving Dhurke's group. Phoenix: In other words, you were testing me. Datz: You're a foreigner, and a lawyer who's been charged with abetting a criminal to boot. And I've seen a fair share of lawyers get pardoned... ...after weeping at the feet of the queen. Phoenix: Well, I'm going to keep fighting till the end. Datz: Yeah, I can see that now. Sorry I ever doubted ya. Phoenix: So, what are you doing here, anyway? Datz: I came to get the secret hideout key from a helper. Phoenix: A secret hideout? Datz: Yep. I was supposed to get my next order from Dhurke there. But the town's swarming with cops thanks to that murder. Nothing I can do about that. Phoenix: What about the order Dhurke was supposed to give you? Datz: Gonna have to abort that mission. Now I'm just lying low, waiting for a chance to make contact with Dhurke again. .........Hey, why the long face? Phoenix: I thought you'd be able to tell me something about the high priest's murder. Datz: Sorry to disappoint ya... Oh, I know. Lemme make it up to ya with this. Phoenix: ...What is it? Datz: This orb is actually a key. It opens the door to one of our secret hideouts. I can't say any more than that. Anyway, I hope it helps. Phoenix: This orb... is a key? Datz: Yep! Plus the hideout's in a totally unexpected location! And being that it's super secret, we couldn't have just any ordinary key! Phoenix: I see... Golden Orb added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Maybe this will help me unravel the truth behind this case. Thanks! Datz: Don't mention it! Besides, you're a fellow brother in arms, fighting the powers that be! If it'll help ya, feel free to pick my brain a bit more. Lady Kee'ra (appears after \"Mr. Are'bal's plan\") Datz: Everyone's been talking about the return of Lady Kee'ra lately. Phoenix: Well, my friend Maya's suspected of being the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra. You wouldn't happen to know who she really is though, would you?! Datz: Beats me. But whoever she is, she bushwhacked me and hauled me off to jail! Even worse, on top o' attacking us and delivering us to the cops... ...she's been watching us like a hawk and framing us for different crimes! Phoenix: Watching you like a hawk? Framing you for crimes? Why would anyone go to all that trouble? Datz: Our kingdom likes to pretend that its people are free to think what they want. Because of that, the authorities can't arrest ya just for sympathizing with the rebellion. So they resort to framing people for things they didn't do. Phoenix: Then that Lady Kee'ra figure is... Datz: Yep, she's just some lickspittle working for the Ga'ran regime. Phoenix: Wow... Inga: Heh, even without the DC Act, Dhurke and his insurgent scum buddies' days are numbered. Phoenix: Wh-What's that supposed to mean?! Inga: Let's just say... I got a little trick up my sleeve. So I'd watch it if I were you. 'Cause you got a defiant attitude -- like one o' them dragon dupes. Phoenix: (So he was talking about Lady Kee'ra, then?) Datz: Advanced combat skills, detailed surveillance, and clever set ups... She's no amateur if ya ask me. Phoenix: So, you're saying the monarchy is using Lady Kee'ra to secretly take out the rebels? Datz: Exactly! The Ga'ran regime is using her to control the people, even down to what we think! Phoenix: Why don't the people protest if the monarchy is doing things like that? Datz: Unfortunately, we don't have any conclusive evidence. And without that, we can't prove anything. Phoenix: Arngh! I know the feeling... If I bring this up in court, they'd probably dismiss it out of hand. (I'll have to unmask Lady Kee'ra if I want to get anywhere.) Goal of the revolution (appears after \"Lady Kee'ra\") Leads to: \"Our goal? To get rid o' that evil, no-good Defense Culpability Act!\" Present Attorney's Badge Datz: I've seen the will of the dragon within ya! You're gonna make a fine rebel! Phoenix: What?! Datz: What's wrong, my friend! You've gotta rise up with me! Har har har har har! Phoenix: Um... I don't recall joining the rebellion, though... Tahrust's Autopsy Report, Inner Sanctum Photo, Nahmanda Flower, or Family Photo Datz: The high priest left Lady Inmee all alone when he died. Even worse, they say she's expecting a baby. Phoenix: It's always hardest for the family members left behind. Datz: I know exactly what you mean. Blast it! If only I could remember what happened after I escaped from prison. Phoenix: (It seems Mr. Are'bal feels responsible for the high priest's death.) Dhurke's Law Book Datz: The dragon emblem branded into that book is a sign of defiance against the Ga'ran regime. That evil law's led to the deaths of many of our brothers in arms. Phoenix: You mean the Defense Culpability Act? Datz: Yep. But we're not gonna stand for it much longer! That's the main reason we have to see this revolution through! Phoenix: (I've never seen him so serious before.) Golden Orb Datz: That orb's the key to the secret hideout. Phoenix: So, where exactly is this hideout, anyway? Datz: Umm............ Phoenix: Don't tell me you forgot when you bumped your head? Datz: .........Har har har har har! Phoenix: (Looks like I'll have to find it myself.) Anything else Datz: Hmm... This is that whatchamacallit, ain't it. Phoenix: What is? Datz: You know, that whatchamacallit. Um... What were we talking about again? Phoenix: It's all right. You don't have to force yourself if you've got nothing to say... Datz: Our goal? To get rid o' that evil, no-good Defense Culpability Act! Phoenix: I can tell just by looking at Dhurke's law book. Datz: The DC Act has turned this kingdom into a corrupt cesspool... ...where false charges are overlooked, and prosecutors are the only ones heard in court. It's been twenty-three years since it was first enacted. Phoenix: What happened twenty-three years ago to make them pass such a terrible law? Datz: The assassination of Queen Amara... That's where it all began. Ahlbi: It happened before I was even born, but... ...Queen Amara -- the previous queen -- was assassinated. And it was the rebel leader Dhurke who did it. Phoenix: Dhurke assassinated the former queen, didn't he? Datz: That's the official line, but... Phoenix: The official line? Datz: Those charges were completely trumped up! Dhurke was framed, I'm telling ya! Phoenix: H-He was?! Datz: Plus, Dhurke was a lawyer. Once the people thought a lawyer had killed the queen, they turned against all lawyers. And that's how the DC Act was first passed. Phoenix: So, that's why there aren't any lawyers left in Khura'in. Datz: Even worse, it changed the significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance. Phoenix: (The significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance?) They were holding S\u00e9ances in court, even before the DC Act? Datz: You bet they were! Lawyers and prosecutors used to hotly contest the Insights that came outta S\u00e9ances. Phoenix: You mean like what I've been doing? Datz: Right! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence. Phoenix: Right... I see what you mean about the significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance changing. Datz: Yep! The Insights became the only truth, and arguing against them was banned! Rayfa: As royal priestess, it is my duty to reveal the truth through the Divination S\u00e9ance. This time, I will prove that the insights I glean thereof are the very truth itself. Prepare yourself, for this shall be your last trial... and your last rites. Tomorrow shall end with you under the headsman's axe! Phoenix: (From what I've seen, Rayfa would agree with that.) Datz: This kingdom's a shadow of its former self. It's become a dictatorship where the royals use the fear of trumped-up charges to rule! Phoenix: And that's what Dhurke's been rebelling against? Datz: Yep. All we want is to live in a kingdom with a fair and impartial legal system. And there's only one way to make that come true: Overthrow the current regime! Phoenix: (So, that's the truth behind the rebels.) Datz: ...Well, PW, my friend, it's about time for me to get going. After all, I AM the fangs of the Defiant Dragons. Datz Are'bal! Phoenix: You're not going to do that \"alley-oop\" thing again, are you? Datz: I was just getting to that! See ya when I see ya! Alley-oop! Phoenix: (Why does he have to jump like that before running off?) ...Well, I guess we're friends now. But enough about that. I've already spent way too much time here! Tehm'pul Temple, Plaza of Devotion, Inner Sanctum, Detention Center, or High Priest's House (before examining manhole, then presenting Brand New Flag in Khura'in - Bazaar) Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: That patch on the accused's bag... It is the Steel Samurai? Phoenix: Yes. It's a huge hit back in my country. Rayfa: I see... It has a rather fine design, I must say. However, it pales beside the Plumed Punisher, of course. Phoenix: Of course... (They all look the same to me, to be honest...) What to do Rayfa: How dare you leave me behind like that! Phoenix: S-Sorry... (It sure was a lot easier without her, though.) Rayfa: Do that again and I will levy a penalty on you! Phoenix: A penalty? Like what...? Rayfa: Like... Oh, I know! You must clean my room. Phoenix: Hey, that's not so bad. Rayfa: ...All thirty of them. Phoenix: Forgive me for leaving you behind, Your Benevolence! May 11Khura'in - Bazaar Phoenix: Whew... I finally got out of there! Ahlbi: Mr. Wright! I'm so glad you're okay! I was so worried about you! Shah'do: *whine* Phoenix: Shah'do... What happened to him, anyway? Ahlbi: He came out of the manhole about five minutes after you went in. Sorry he wasn't much help! Shah'do: *whine* Rayfa: ...Well? Did you find anything of worth? Phoenix: Oh, uh... I tripped and fell down there. I must've been out cold for a while. (I better keep things to myself for now.) Rayfa: I figured as much. Phoenix: (I have to find that secret hideout Mr. Are'bal was talking about. I should probably start with places that have something to do with the high priest.) Examine Manhole Rayfa: What is it, Barbed Head? Is the sewer calling to you once more? Phoenix: Not exactly... (I probably shouldn't tell her about Mr. Are'bal...) Talk Any ideas? Rayfa: Barbed Head... I detect a foul odor emanating from you. Phoenix: Well, I did walk through the sewers, so... Rayfa: Stay back! Keep your stink to yourself! Phoenix: I'd be glad to leave you alone if you'd like. Rayfa: Who said you could walk away from me, you muttonhead! Phoenix: Fine, I'll stick to you like glue. Rayfa: No, that is too close! Phoenix: (I just can't win with her.) What to do Rayfa: Even after investigating the sewers, you have nothing. Phoenix: Well, I'm not ready to give up yet! (Besides, I wouldn't say I have nothing.) There's nowhere I wouldn't go if it would help Maya! Rayfa: So, what will it be next? Will you dive into a septic tank? Phoenix: Uuh... I-If it would help Maya, I wouldn't rule it out! Rayfa: S-Stay back! Phoenix: I thought it was just a hypothetical! Present Golden Orb Rayfa: That orb has a mesmerizing core. I must take a closer look at it. Phoenix: (Mr. Are'bal entrusted me with this, so maybe I shouldn't let even Princess Rayfa handle it.) Y-Your Benevolence? Wouldn't you be defiled by touching an object that has been in the hands of a lawyer? Rayfa: I suppose so. Phoenix: ...You do know that there are no such things as lawyer cooties, right? May 11Inner Sanctum Rayfa: Barbed Head. You already searched here, did you not? Phoenix: Oh, umm... I just thought I'd look around again. You know, in case I missed something? (I probably shouldn't tell her I'm looking for the secret rebel hideout.) We have a saying back home: \"Leave no stone unturned.\" Rayfa: Hmm? ...Oh, yes. You cannot stump me. I know that one. Phoenix: (Actually, \"I don't have a clue\" is written all over your face...) Examine Prayer flags Phoenix: I can't believe Mr. Are'bal used this as a parachute. Rayfa: That reckless fool... Then again, he must have a screw loose if he counts himself among those vile rebels. Phoenix: (I wouldn't exactly call him crazy... but he's certainly one-of-a-kind.) Left side of warbaa'd statue Phoenix: It's a statue of a bird... Guess I'll take a closer look at it. (Changed from [It's a statue of a bird... I should take a closer look later.] in the original release) Statue's missing eye Leads to: \"Hey, this eye is missing.\" Phoenix: Hey, this eye is missing. Rayfa: What are you doing? You must not touch that for no reason! Phoenix: S-Sorry! But that shape... Hmm, I wonder... Present Golden Orb Phoenix: Leads to: \"I knew it!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This might fit in that cavity. Rayfa: Pohlkunka! Wh-What are you doing?! You... chowderhead! Remove your hand from there this instant! Phoenix: S-Sorry! I just thought this might fit in there. Rayfa: Are you blind?! They have entirely different shapes! Phoenix: (Yeah, that was a long shot. Still, I can't help feeling I have something that would fit in there.) Rayfa: Do not let me catch you needlessly touching the statue again! Phoenix: A-Alright already, I get it... Leads back to: \"But that shape... Hmm, I wonder...\" Phoenix: I knew it! Rayfa: Wh-Wh-Wha...?! ........................ Phoenix: (She must be at a loss for words. And that doesn't happen too often.) Rayfa: ...What is this place?! E-Explain yourself at once, Barbed Head! Phoenix: (I don't think she's ready for the full story...) I don't really know much myself, but... It seems to be a secret rebel hideout. (If I'm shocked there's a secret door here, I imagine that goes double for Rayfa.) Rayfa: A rebel hideout in the Inner Sanctum?! Somebody will pay for this! Phoenix: W-Well for now, I think I'll have a look around. Rayfa: Wait! You must not enter before the police! Phoenix: Don't worry, I won't disturb anything. (Or at least I'll try not to...) Besides, with you watching over me, it should be fine, right? And, uh, you see... Rayfa: ...Fine. Just please stop pleading your case. I can only stand so much lawyerly drivel. But I will be presenting all information gleaned from your efforts here to the police. Phoenix: Of course. Now, shall we? Rayfa: I will go no further. Phoenix: Oh, right. You're not supposed to come in contact with the taint of Lady Kee'ra's battles. Rayfa: Very good, Barbed Head. I commend you for remembering! Phoenix: O-Oh, well thank you! (Wait, why am I thanking her?) Rayfa: I may not be able to enter, but I will allow no misdeeds on your part. I will be watching you like a warbaa'd from the entrance here! Phoenix: I told you I'm not going to do anything! (I better hurry before she changes her mind!) Examine Revolving door Phoenix: (Who'd have guessed a rebel hideout would be at the back of the Inner Sanctum? Then again, the sanctum's not open to the public. What better place to hide away from prying eyes?) May 11Secret Hideout Rayfa: I believe this to be a sacred space that enshrines the source of the spring water. Phoenix: (That makes sense. The rebels must've converted it into a secret hideout. But what about that warbaa'd revolving door? I wonder if that, too, was originally intended to hide and protect this sacred space.) Rayfa: To think those filthy rebels were scheming their schemes in this most sacred space...! It is a desecration upon Khura'inism itself! The Defiant Dragons shall pay for this! Phoenix: (I suppose it's only natural that she'd be upset. But the investigation must go on!) I think I'll start by taking a picture of the place. (Good thing I brought a camera to snap some souvenir shots.) Rayfa: Stop that! You must not take photos here without permission! Phoenix: (Rayfa's really fired up. She's sticking her head in as far as it will go. I guess she won't be \"tainted\" as long as she doesn't touch anything...?) Rebel Hideout Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Now, to search every nook and cranny... Rayfa: Barbed Head! Just because it is hard for me to see your every move... ...do not use that as an excuse to touch and break things! Phoenix: I heard you the first time! (Sheesh...) Examine Banner Rayfa: How dare those filthy insurgents raise their banner amid such a sacred space! Barbed Head! You must burn it at once! Phoenix: ...Um, didn't you tell me not to touch or damage anything? Rayfa: Hmph, this is an exception! Very well, if you will not do it, then I will! Phoenix: But, Your Benevolence, I thought you're not supposed to come in here. Rayfa: Nngrrrrrrr...! Phoenix: (For once, the strange customs of this kingdom are working in my favor.) Hm? (There's something under the banner. A microphone? What's this doing here? Was someone trying to record something with it?) Smaller stone slab Phoenix: A large stone slab... (It's shaped like a magatama. It looks rather unstable. I bet it'd tip over in an earthquake.) Hm? What's that earthy, grass-like smell? Rayfa: It is the smell of the moss that covers the stone. Phoenix: Oh, so this shaggy green stuff is moss... ...Hm? It looks like some of the moss about halfway up has been disturbed. ...I wonder why that is? (One quick touch can't hurt, right...?) Whoa! (The slab's starting to wobble!) Rayfa: What is happening?! What have you done to the sacred space?! Phoenix: N-N-Nothing! (All I did was nudge it a little... I knew it looked unstable. Probably best not to touch it again.) Water or larger stone slab Phoenix: So, this is the water source that supplies the Inner Sanctum's spring. It flows through the channel built into the floor before heading outside. Rayfa: Lady Kee'ra uses this sacred water to wash the taint of battle from her body. Phoenix: It's also not red like the water in the spring. Chart Phoenix: Looks like an order from Dhurke. Rayfa: What's this?! Let me see that! Phoenix: I thought you're not supposed to touch anything in here. Rayfa: This is an exception! Now hand it over! Let's see here... Hmm... ...O Holy Mother! Phoenix: What? What does it say? Rayfa: It is an order intended for that rebel named Datz. It reads... \"After the rite, infiltrate the palace under the guise of returning Lady Kee'ra's costume... ...and search for clues about that incident from twenty-three years ago. --Dhurke\" Phoenix: Twenty-three years ago? He must mean the assassination of Queen Amara. I wonder what the rebels are up to... (It's intriguing and all, but it doesn't seem related to the case at hand.) Rayfa: This will not do! I must warn my mother at once! Phoenix: No need to do that. This order will never be carried out. Lady Kee'ra's costume is still here, and Abbot Inmee is no longer able to aid the rebels. Rayfa: Hmph, I-I knew that! Chart (subsequent times) Rayfa: Is there anything else you would like me to read, Barbed Head? Phoenix: Oh, um, let's see... Uhh... How about this note? Rayfa: Let me see that. Konuuro, zabaas, bahr'bahr, yak, and roux... Wait, this looks familiar! Phoenix: What is it? Some kind of Khura'inist spell? Rayfa: No, it's a recipe for Khura'inese curry. Phoenix: I guess the rebels enjoy a home-cooked meal, just like everyone else. Plumed Punisher poster Phoenix: There's a Plumed Punisher calendar here. Rayfa: Ah, now I understand. The villains in The Plumed Punisher are based on the insurgents. Watching the show must have roused their ire against Lady Kee'ra! Phoenix: (Umm... I doubt that's it.) Plumed Punisher clock Phoenix: Look! Rayfa: What is it, Barbed Head? Phoenix: It's a Plumed Punisher clock! Rayfa: Why, I believe it's... It is a limited-edition promotional item given to fifty lucky viewers! This rare item plays the Plumed Punisher theme song ever hour! H-Hand it over now, Barbed Head! Phoenix: Ah! (She snatched it away from me! No matter what she says, Rayfa is definitely a huge fan.) Rayfa: Hmm... What a fine item. And this switch... If I'm right... Phoenix: (It's the Plumed Punisher theme song...) Rayfa: Yes, now I see! The insurgents who use this room... ...must be Plumed Punisher fans! Phoenix: ...That may be so, but I don't see how it's relevant to this case. Chain Phoenix: The statue door rotates when you pull this chain. Rayfa: I see...Then you must shut the door and destroy its mechanism! That will deprive the insurgents of access to this place! Phoenix: B-But wouldn't that trap me in here? Rayfa: Not to worry! I would come to visit you once a year. Phoenix: (She's actually serious!) Cart or guns Phoenix: Weapons! And lots of them, too. Rayfa: We are lucky we found them before they could be used. Excellent work, Barbed Head! Phoenix: Oh, uh, thanks... (If the rebellion ever happens, I hope it's bloodless.) Bloodstain Phoenix: What's this? A bloodstain...? I should probably try to figure out what happened in here. Hmm... Rayfa: Do not tamper with any evidence before the police arrive! Phoenix: ...The police? Hey, that reminds me. Ema gave me something just for times like these. Ema: I thought it might help your investigation. Here, it's all yours! I wanted to bring you a bunch of other forensic tools... ...but they were confiscated at the airport. Phoenix: (Luminol testing fluid... This actually might come in handy.) Phoenix: (Luminol testing fluid glows in reaction to even the tiniest traces of blood. So it can even detect areas where blood has been wiped up. It might help us figure out what happened in here. Okay, time for science to do its thing! First, let me put these red-tinted glasses on to see the luminol's glow... ...then I just press [A / Space] wherever I want to spray some of the luminol. (Changed from [...then I just touch wherever I want to spray some of the luminol.] in the original release) Areas where there was blood will react by turning blue.) Spray area near where waterway diverges Leads to: Leads to: \"Th-This is a huge bloodstain! Something big must've happened here!\" Phoenix: Th-This is a huge bloodstain! Something big must've happened here! Rayfa: Perhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue. Phoenix: ...There was definitely a lot of blood here. But it's impossible to say much else at this point. I'll just take a picture for now. Oh, right. Luminol reactions don't show up in photos. I'll just have to take some notes. That should do it! (...I didn't notice before, but the bloodstain looks like it was smeared away in one place. Is it because the warbaa'd revolving door passed over it?) Rebel Hideout Photo updated in the Court Record. Bloodstain (subsequent times) Phoenix: That bloodstain on the floor... The luminol showed that it was even bigger than I expected. Something definitely happened here, and it wasn't good. Rayfa: How can you be so sure? Perhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue. Phoenix: True... But there's not much else we can say at this point. After examining banner, smaller stone slab, chart, Plumed Punisher clock, and bloodstain: Phoenix: ...Well, I think that covers about everything here. Ema: Mr. Wright! You shouldn't have come in here before the police! Phoenix: Sorry, but I was in a hurry. I didn't do anything I wasn't supposed to. Her Benevolence can attest to that. Rayfa: It is your fault for being so slow. I expect the police to work faster and more efficiently! Ema: Sorry... Rayfa: Well, Barbed Head? Have you not already seen enough? Phoenix: I guess it's about time I got back to the temple and go over everything I've learned. May 11Tehm'pul Temple Ahlbi: Welcome back, Mr. Wright! How'd it go? Phoenix: Unfortunately, I didn't find anything conclusive. Ahlbi: N-No way! Rayfa: ...I do not understand, Barbed Head. Phoenix: What don't you understand? Rayfa: Why you did not commit any misdeeds during your investigation. After all, lawyers ply their trade primarily through illicit means and methods. Phoenix: What?! Who told you that? Rayfa: My mother. Are you saying she was wrong? ...No, that cannot be! You must have committed some sort of misdeed right under my nose. Phoenix: (If that were so, she wasted her whole day following me around.) Rayfa: Hm? What is it? ........................ Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has need of me. Phoenix: What's going on? Rayfa: I must go perform a Divination S\u00e9ance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins. Phoenix: I see... Rayfa: .........The third time will be the charm. My insights will finally bring you to your knees tomorrow! And I will teach that neophyte practitioner a lesson! Phoenix: (Looks like the royal priestess is back with a vengeance. She's made a full recovery from when we started the investigation earlier today.) I look forward to seeing you in court, Your Benevolence! Rayfa: Hmph. Your overconfidence will be your downfall. You will not look so confident when I am finished with you tomorrow! Phoenix: Actually... I'm not really looking forward to seeing her tomorrow. Especially without any solid evidence. Ahlbi: Why don't we go over everything you know so far? Phoenix: All right. Hmm, let's see here... Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed during the rite with Lady Kee'ra's dagger. And Maya's fingerprints were found on it. Ahlbi: That doesn't sound very good! Phoenix: I know... It's the very definition of being up a creek without a paddle. The day before his murder, Zeh'lot enjoyed a meal with the high priest, his wife, and Maya. I also learned about spirit channeling here in Khura'in. Ahlbi: None of that sounds very helpful. Phoenix: Oh, but I did hear something interesting. That the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra might be working for the justice minister. Ahlbi: What?! Really?! Our kingdom is supposed to be ruled through faith and laws. We can't allow the people to be controlled by fear and violence! Phoenix: Ahlbi, that sounds like something a rebel might say. Ahlbi: I-It does? But if that Lady Kee'ra really is one of Minister Inga's subordinates... ...that would exonerate Miss Maya! Phoenix: Unfortunately, I have no way of proving it in court. Ahlbi: ...Oh, that's too bad. Phoenix: Oh, I almost forgot about the secret rebel hideout we found at the Inner Sanctum. There was a bloodstain inside. But I don't know if or how it's connected to this case, though. Ahlbi: Wow! A secret room at the Inner Sanctum?! That would be a huge hit with tourists! Phoenix: (This kid really is an entrepreneur at heart.) Ahlbi: ...Er, what I mean is that hideout could be important to your case. Phoenix: Maybe, but it's still too early to tell. Argh... Looks like I'm heading into court without any useful evidence. Ahlbi: We'll just have to pray something appears during tomorrow's trial... Phoenix: Princess Rayfa's Divination S\u00e9ance might be my only hope. There could be some new information in it that might help. Ahlbi: Th-The Divination S\u00e9ance?! But I thought it always works against the accused! Phoenix: ...Not always. Datz: Right! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence. Ahlbi: Really?! I never heard anyone say that before. It's hard to figure you out sometimes, sir. Phoenix: (Divination S\u00e9ances worked both ways before the Defense Culpability Act. It's only now that the people of Khura'in find it strange.) Ahlbi: Um, Mr. Wright? I just wanted to say... good luck tomorrow! Phoenix: Thanks. I can't afford to lose this next one. (I've collected all sorts of information, but I haven't even started connecting the dots. If I could do that, I might have a shot at pulling off a win. Rayfa's Insights will be the deciding factor. It's a huge gamble, but it's all I've got!) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Phoenix: I've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I'm pretty sure I know what I need to, but... ...maybe I should go over it all again.)\nThe Rite of Turnabout Image Gallery TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4May 12, 9:34 AMHigh Court of Khura'in - Accused LobbyMaya: .........Phoenix: (Maya looks exhausted, but I can't blame her.)Maya: Nick, I was thinking about it all day yesterday... I never properly asked you to defend me, did I?Phoenix: It doesn't matter. I'm on this case till the bitter end.Maya: I know. That's why... I wanted to officially ask you for your help.Phoenix: You got it, Maya! Let's do this. We gotta wrap this up and get back home so you can make your dream show come true. \"The Steel Samurai vs. The Plumed Punisher,\" right?Maya: You bet!Rayfa: You look as if you did not sleep last night, Barbed Head. It is written all over your face. How can you expect to put up a respectable defense like that?Phoenix: I-I'm all fired up, and raring to go! (I guess Maya's not the only one looking exhausted.)Rayfa: ...........................Phoenix: (Hm? Rayfa doesn't seem in the best spirits herself.)Rayfa: Hmph. Go ahead, feign confidence now while you are still able. For I will see to it that your last rites are read to you this day!Phoenix: (Heh, guess it was just my imagination...)Maya: Ready, Nick?Phoenix: Okay, Maya, let's head on in!May 12High Court of Khura'inDay 2Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge: Now then, if everyone is ready...Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Magistry.Nahyuta: The prosecution is ready. Let us begin without further delay.Judge: Oh, no prayers this time, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta: I already offered my prayers for the latest victim during my visit to the crime scene. Being that the accused has already been found guilty of the first murder... ...let us hasten this trial, so we may put this dead lawyer walking out of his misery.Judge: I could not agree more. In yesterday's trial, the accused was already found guilty of murdering the high priest. And today she will be tried for the murder of his disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot. Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your opening statement, if you would.Nahyuta: ...Certainly. The accused has now slain two of the most devout clergymen in Khura'inism. Even the lowest level of Hell -- the Hell of Tickling -- would not be punishment enough.Judge: *gulp* Th-Then... what t-terrible fate awaits her?Nahyuta: Bahlgilpo'kon Hell -- a realm of eternal agony. There she will suffer the endless punishment of ja'gar by the galuun of Puhlmo'ten. Furthermore, Guhljaama--Judge: E-Enough, enough! My blood runs cold at the mere thought that such a terrible place exists.Phoenix: (I was going to ask for a translation, but on second thought, ignorance is bliss.)Judge: N-Now then, please continue, minus the part about the terrible hell awaiting the accused.Nahyuta: As you wish... The victim of this heinous crime was the high priest's disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot. He had been training under the high priest while living at the priest's home.Judge: I had met him a number of times, and he seemed like an earnest young man. How tragic that he met such a terrible end.Nahyuta: The murder occurred at the Plaza of Devotion, during the Purification Rite. It was a bold crime carried out while the plaza was full of the faithful deep in prayer. The Warbaa'd Dagger was found impaled in the victim's upper back. The stabbing caused a spinal cord injury that killed him instantly.Judge: Ah, the Warbaa'd Dagger. Lady Kee'ra's weapon of choice.Nahyuta: We have already established that the accused's prints were on the weapon. Incredibly damning evidence in itself.Maya: N-No... I didn't do it!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Hold your tongue. Now, being that the accused, Maya Fey, is a serial killer... ...the prosecution believes that the death penalty is the only possible sentence.Judge: Would the defense care to respond?Phoenix: The accused is innocent, and nothing can convince me otherwise! After all, the crime scene was packed with worshippers. How could my client possibly have committed this murder without a single witness?Nahyuta: The accused's fingerprints on the murder weapon alone is enough to render a verdict. As such, I see no need to debate this any further.Phoenix: B-But...!Judge: Well, once Her Benevolence conducts her S\u00e9ance, it will be clear for all to see.Nahyuta: ............... Your Magistry, might I have a word?Judge: Hm? Is something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta: It is about the Divination S\u00e9ance...Rayfa:Judge: Y-Your Benevolence!Rayfa: Stop right there, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.Nahyuta: ...As you wish. Forgive me for overstepping my bounds.Phoenix: (What was that all about?)Rayfa: Barbed Head, have you made peace with your fate? For this time, the Divination S\u00e9ance will bring you to your knees!Phoenix: I'm ready. And I accept your challenge. (The only problem is, I have no weapons at my disposal. Our only hope now is what we can glean from the S\u00e9ance vision and Rayfa's Insights.)Judge: Very well. The Divination S\u00e9ance if you please, Your Benevolence.Rayfa: Yes, let us begin. ...Nayna! O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination S\u00e9ance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!Rayfa: ............Phoenix: ............Judge: ............Phoenix:  (I don't get it. Why wasn't there anything to see?)Judge: Y-Your Benevolence! What in the world...?Rayfa: Urgh... I was unable to evoke any sort of response. I called out the spirit's name many times... but to no avail!Nahyuta: Just as I thought...Phoenix: (Wait, what does he know that we don't?)Nahyuta: I had sought to confirm the contents of today's Divination S\u00e9ance. After all, it is customary for the prosecutor to verify it beforehand.Phoenix: (Come to think of it...)Rayfa: I must go perform a Divination S\u00e9ance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins.Nahyuta: And that is why I sought to stop Her Benevolence from performing it here. However, she insisted that it be done. She wished to try one more time here in the Hall of Justice.Judge: It would appear Her Benevolence is tired from her manifold duties.Rayfa: I am not anything of the sort! The victim's spirit will not answer my call, but I know not why! It is my sacred duty to convey the truth through the Divination S\u00e9ance!Phoenix: (Rayfa...)Judge: What are we to do without a Divination S\u00e9ance?Nahyuta: I suppose I shall have to deliver the last rites without them. The prosecution has already taken that into account when preparing for today. I am fully capable of proving the accused's guilt, with or without a Divination S\u00e9ance.Judge: Ha ha ha ha ha! You never fail to impress, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.Phoenix: (This is bad... The Divination S\u00e9ance was my one and only hope.) Your Magistry, Her Benevolence said she isn't tired! So, shouldn't we try to find out why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed?Rayfa: !Judge: How curious, Mr. Wright. Why have you suddenly taken such a keen interest in the Divination S\u00e9ance?Rayfa: Yes, explain yourself! The Divination S\u00e9ance is for shedding light on an accused's crimes! It is the Holy Mother's hammer of wrath, that is ever poised to pound you into your grave! You should fear it, not plead for it!Phoenix: ...I believe in my client. Plus, yesterday, somebody told me something that changed my mind: The Divination S\u00e9ance was once thought of as just another piece of evidence. If we were to correctly interpret the visions through careful analysis... ...then they would lead us to the truth behind what really happened. And the truth will show that my client, Maya Fey, is innocent.Maya: The truth is, you don't have anything else to fall back on, huh, Nick?Phoenix: ...Maya, please, you're not helping.Rayfa: How dare you?! The voice of a mitamah is to be feared, not utilized by vile lawyers such as you!Nahyuta: S\u00e9ances exact a heavy toll upon the royal priestess. It would be best not to burden her any further. Or does the defense feel that it can pose no counterarguments without the S\u00e9ance?Phoenix: N-No, of course not! (He saw right through me! I'll have to find a way to make the Divination S\u00e9ance happen, or we're toast.)Judge: Well, since the Divination S\u00e9ance is not possible at this time, I see no other choice. Let us proceed with the trial without the S\u00e9ance, as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi suggested.Nahyuta: Thank you, Your Magistry.Rayfa: Why you...! I will not forget this, Barbed Head! This will NOT be the last you see of me!Nahyuta: Now then, I will now proceed by providing an outline of the case at hand.Judge: Very well. If the lead detective would please come to the stand, we may begin.Ema: ........................ ...Sorry, Mr. Wright.Nahyuta: Detective Skye... I understand how you would wish to save the accused and the defense. They are your friends, after all. But you must let them go... and move on.Ema: B-But...!Nahyuta: There is only one way to save them now: By giving their souls the chance to burn away the taint of their sins in the infernal flames.Ema: Ooh... I... I... I can't do this!Judge: Ah! No eating in the sacred Hall of Justice!Maya: Ms. Skye!Ema: Y-Yes?!Maya: Don't worry about me and Nick. You just do your job. I'm sure Nick will figure something out... eventually!Ema: ............... Right. Thanks, Ms. Fey.Nahyuta: How very brave for a criminal with a tainted soul. Very well, Detective Skye. Please proceed.Ema: Okay, I can do this... Let me start with an overview of this case.Witness Testimony-- Overview of the Second Murder --Ema: The latest victim was Puhray Zeh'lot. He had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years. The high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body. He may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.Judge: I see... Well, that certainly makes sense. Would the defense care to respond?Phoenix: (I didn't spot any inconsistencies in her testimony so far. And I don't have any evidence in my arsenal. What am I going to do now?)Maya: Hmm...Phoenix: What is it, Maya?Maya: I was just wondering about how much the police actually looked into Acolyte Zeh'lot. Because it just might prove to be the key as to why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed.Phoenix: What are you getting at?Maya: Umm, well... It's just a hunch.Phoenix: (Wait a second. During my investigation... ...Rayfa told me about how the Divination S\u00e9ance works. If I could figure out why it failed... ...maybe she could try it again. Okay! Time to press for some more information!)Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- Overview of the Second Murder --Ema: The latest victim was Puhray Zeh'lot.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of person was Acolyte Zeh'lot? Ema: According to the neighbors and others who knew him... ...he was a deeply devout youth. Nahyuta: I, too, have heard his name mentioned as one who was a fervent practitioner. I suppose you might say he was the high priest's star disciple. Ema: Furthermore...Ema: He had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Two years? Are you sure about that? Ema: We took statements from his neighbors and his fellow monks. They all corroborate our initial findings. Phoenix: What about you, Maya? Maya: ...Well, when I first came here... ...I saw Zeh'lot praying under the high priest's instruction. Phoenix: I see... So the results of the police investigation seem to check out...Ema: The high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was Mrs. Inmee's positive ID the only way you verified the identity of the victim? Ema: Huh? ...Well, no! We also checked the ID card he carried and the data in his family registry. But... Phoenix: But what? Ema: His personal information didn't match any of the public records we cross-referenced. Phoenix: Maybe that's why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed. Ema: I-I'm not sure what you mean, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Here's what I'm thinking... His address was wrong Phoenix: The victim's address was wrong! Ema: Um... Mr. Wright? Even if it was wrong, how would that affect the Divination S\u00e9ance? Phoenix: Oh, uhh... You're right. It wouldn't. (What was it that a Divination S\u00e9ance required, again? Oh, right! Then there is only one possible answer!) Ema: It looks like the fact that his personal info wasn't in the public records isn't important. Phoenix: No, Ema, it is important. Leads to: \"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason...\" Puhray Zeh'lot is a fake name Leads to: \"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason...\" Phoenix: The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason... In other words, he was using a fake name! The royal priestess uses a deceased's face and true name to summon their spirit. Rayfa: Why, yes, that is indeed true. Nahyuta: If he was using a forged ID and there is no mention of him in our public records... ...then he was likely an illegal immigrant. They are not uncommon here in Khura'in. Phoenix: An illegal immigrant? (Come to think of it, Rayfa mentioned something about immigrants yesterday.) Ema: But if that's the case, we have no way of knowing who he really is. We'll have to proceed without holding a Divination S\u00e9ance this time. Phoenix: Urk! Judge: I had always thought that Acolyte Zeh'lot was Khura'inese. Oh, how the high priest must be lamenting his disciple's deception in the Twilight Realm. Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think? Should we add this to the testimony? Add it to the testimony Phoenix: This is an important fact. Please add it to the testimony. Judge: Hmm... It would seem to be a fact most inconvenient for the defense. But, if you insist. Detective Skye, please add what you just said to your testimony. Ema: Yes, Your Magistry. Adds statement \"He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.\" Don't add it to the testimony Phoenix: No, Your Magistry. There's no need to add it to her testimony. Judge: Very well, then. Please continue if you would, Detective Skye. Ema: Yes, Your Magistry. We still don't know the victim's true identity, but... Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: But the victim was using a fake name, so... ...he may very well have been in Khura'in illegally. Ema: Y-Yes, that's very likely the case. Phoenix: (Now that I have an opening, what next? It's still not going to help me learn Zeh'lot's true identity. Was he really an illegal alien?)Ema: He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Isn't there some way to track down his real name? Ema: No, not if he was an illegal immigrant. Phoenix: Have you actually confirmed that he was in Khura'in illegally? Ema: Well, we don't have any conclusive evidence. But there's also no evidence of him being a citizen of Khura'in, either. Phoenix: Hoh boy... Now what do we do... Maya: What if there was a clue in the evidence you gathered? Phoenix: That's probably our only hope at this point. (If he really was an illegal immigrant, our proverbial goose is probably cooked.)Present Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Sorry, Detective Skye...\"Ema: He may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya isn't that Lady Kee'ra who's been going around capturing rebels! Ema: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright, but...  Nahyuta: Nahyuta: That verdict was already handed down in the previous trial. It is no longer a point of dispute, and I will not allow you to make it so. Phoenix: But...! Nahyuta: No \"ifs,\" \"ands,\" and most of all, no \"buts.\" The accused was posing as Lady Kee'ra. And she killed Acolyte Zeh'lot because she mistakenly believed him to be a rebel. Maya: Th-That's not true! Ema: I'm sorry... The verdict has already been read in that case. I have to assume that it's fact now. Phoenix: Arngh!Before adding statement Phoenix: Maya, you mentioned that Ema's testimony might hold a clue as to why the S\u00e9ance failed. Maya: I did, but it's really just a hunch. Phoenix: (That might mean there was a mistake made during the investigation. It would have to be information that would impact the S\u00e9ance. Hmm, what could it be...?)After adding statement Phoenix: (Now I know why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed, but...) Maya: Umm, nothing's really changed. Phoenix: Yeah, which means we're in big trouble. Maya: If he really was an illegal immigrant, it's going to be real hard to find out his real name... Phoenix: (I guess our only choice is to give up on the whole Divination S\u00e9ance thing. If only there was some way to find out the victim's real name...)-- I Have an Alibi --Tahrust: I have an ironclad alibi for the time during which the murder took place.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You used the word alibi as if it were second nature. Tahrust: Hrrrmmm... Are you, perhaps, mocking me? Or is it, perhaps, the Kingdom of Khura'in itself you wish to ridicule? Gallery: C'mon! Everyone and their grandma knows what alibi means!We're not a bunch of country bumpkins here! We have plenty of courtroom dramas on TV! Judge: Peace, peace! Peace, I say! Mr. Wright, would you care to clarify your last statement? Phoenix: P-Please! Don't take it the wrong way! It's just, alibi is a rather technical term for a priest to use so naturally. Tahrust: I assure you, I know how to use the term. In fact, I had even hoped for a chance to do so one day. I suppose that even I, a high priest, am not immune to such trivial worldly attachments. Phoenix: O-Oh, I see... (Still, he seems unusually calm and composed. It's almost as if he had prepped himself for something like this...)Tahrust: Just past noon on the day before the rite, I was entertaining guests at my home.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Guests...? And you were entertaining them personally? Tahrust: That I was. We gathered around the table for a most enjoyable conversation. Phoenix: (He said his guests could corroborate his alibi. That can't be good for our case.) Phoenix: Are you sure that was the same day as the murder? Maybe you've misremembered. Tahrust: KAAAAAAAH! Do not doubt my mnemonic faculties! I may have died, but my memories up to that point are crystal clear! Phoenix: S-Sorry...  (...He's pretty thin-skinned for a priest. Though, I guess I should've known better than to doubt his memory...) Rayfa: A spirit's memory is cut off at the moment of death. Phoenix: So even a spirit that is brought back after centuries doesn't sense any gap in time... ...between the moment of its death, and the moment it is channeled? Rayfa: Yes, and yet, it clearly recalls all of the memories it had in life. Tahrust: Ahh... There's nothing better than enjoying gingihl cuisine with dear friends. That way, everyone's breath becomes equally malodorous! Phoenix: Right...Tahrust: And I believe my guests can corroborate this.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And who exactly were your guests that day? Don't tell me they were rebels, so they can't be called here to testify... Tahrust: It was none other than His Magistry, along with his family. He couldn't attend the rite due to work, so he stopped by ahead of time. My my, how his daughter has grown. Phoenix: ...Wait a second. Judge: Let me set the record straight right now. I am NOT a rebel. Thank you for that wonderful meal, Abbot Inmee. Lady Inmee's cooking simply cannot be beat! Tahrust: ...So there you have it. Phoenix: When exactly was His Magistry at your home? Tahrust: He was there from 2 PM to 3 PM. Indeed, precisely the time period within which Acolyte Zeh'lot was slain. Judge: Yes, and we had a rousing chat concerning the game of Kachu'demahl. Phoenix: B-But...! Judge: I'll just have that added to the testimony. After all, it was I who visited the high priest's home. Adds statement \"My guests that day were His Magistry and his family. They visited from 2 PM to 3 PM.\"Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: And who exactly were your guests that day? Don't tell me they were rebels, so they can't be called here to testify... Tahrust: It was none other than His Magistry, along with his family. He couldn't attend the rite due to work, so he stopped by ahead of time. My my, how his daughter has grown.

They visited from 2 PM to 3 PM.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-Your Magistry, are you sure this testimony is completely accurate? Judge: As sure as sure can be! Oh, how wonderful it is to finally have my actions be admissible as evidence in court! Tahrust: His Magistry was at my home during the exact time period of the murder. Come, let us put this behind us. I could not have possibly committed this crime. Phoenix: How can you be so sure? What if the clock or watch you were using was off, or you misread the time? Judge: There was a clock right near the table, and it had the exact same time as my watch. Tahrust: Now do you understand, lawyer?Phoenix: How am I going to attack his alibi? Maya, what do you... Oh, right... She's kind of busy right now.Tahrust: What? Is there something on my face? Hrrrmm?Phoenix: N-No, not at all! (I'll just have to start chipping away at that statement about his alibi.)After pressing all statements:Tahrust: As you can see, my alibi is airtight. Or do you still think I could have killed Acolyte Zeh'lot?Phoenix: Argh...! (His Magistry's a witness?!)Nahyuta: Are you satisfied now? There is not a single discrepancy in Abbot Inmee's alibi.Phoenix: (I-If I give up now, it's all over!) N-Now hold on a second! (Is there something, ANYTHING wrong with the high priest's testimony?)There is Leads to: \"There IS a discrepancy in the high priest's testimony!\"There isn't Phoenix: Wait... Never mind. Nahyuta: I thought as much. After all, there can be no killer other than the accused. Judge: Indeed. And therefore, I see no need to continue these proceedings. Phoenix: (Do I really want to give up now? If I do, Maya will be found guilty. Was there really not a single thing wrong with the high priest's testimony?) Please, Your Magistry, wait. Leads to: \"There IS a discrepancy in the high priest's testimony!\"Phoenix: There IS a discrepancy in the high priest's testimony!Judge: There is? Well then, perhaps you could explain what it might be.Phoenix: This is what was wrong with his testimony.The prayer feast was short Phoenix: The meal was too short to be a Feast of Blessings celebration. Nahyuta: The length of the feast is of no consequence. Besides, Lady Inmee's testimony regarding the feast was the same as her husband's. Or would you suggest Abbot Inmee and his wife are lying? Judge: Hmm. I see no problem as you allege. Phoenix: Oops... I guess I'm wrong then. Judge: It seems there is nothing wrong with Abbot Inmee's testimony. Phoenix: I beg to differ. There IS a problem! A big one! Leads back to: \"This is what was wrong with his testimony.\"He's too friendly with the judge Phoenix: He's way too friendly with you, Your Magistry. Are you two perhaps, more than just friends? Judge: M-M-Mr. Wright! What on earth are you suggesting?! Phoenix: You seem awfully flustered, Your Magistry. That seems kind of suspicious. Tahrust: You are free to think anything you like about our relationship. But it has nothing to do with the case at hand. Judge: I concur! Now, I believe you know what comes next. Phoenix: (Guess I got a little carried away there...) Judge: It seems there is nothing wrong with Abbot Inmee's testimony. Phoenix: I beg to differ. There IS a problem! A big one! Leads back to: \"This is what was wrong with his testimony.\"He knew the time of the crime Leads to: \"After Abbot Inmee was channeled...\"Phoenix: After Abbot Inmee was channeled... ...no one ever stated what time Acolyte Zeh'lot was murdered!Judge: N-Now that you mention it...!Phoenix: Despite that, you claim to have an alibi from 2 PM to 3 PM. That means you knew that Acolyte Zeh'lot was dead... ...when you were still alive!Tahrust: Haaargh!Phoenix: (Wait... I think I saw something just now... No, I must be imagining things.) So, tell me, how did you know what time the crime had been committed?Tahrust: Ummm... About that... Hrrrmmmmmm... HRRRRNH! ...Open your heart! Let the Holy Mother in!Judge: Wh-Why! We've been blessed with the high priest's sacred words of prayer!Tahrust: All who serve Her Holiness must strive to banish worldly desires from their soul! Open your heart! Let the Holy Mother in! Purge your mind of greed and bias!Judge: I feel as if my very soul has been cleansed!Phoenix: You can't fool me! Prayer may banish worldly desires, but it can't make a contradiction disappear!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: How can you be so sure?Phoenix: (What's that supposed to mean?)Nahyuta: This lawyer seems to think little of the power of Khura'inist prayer.Phoenix: Huh?Nahyuta: Abbot Inmee was at home during the crime, but knew of what happened at the hideout. I believe this can be explained thusly... He must have had a way to monitor the hideout from his home.Phoenix: What?!Tahrust: .................. Y-You never cease to amaze, Prosecutor. As he has surmised, there was a listening device installed at the hideout. It enabled me to instantly learn of anything unusual, even when I was not there.Nahyuta: Remember, the rebels had been using this as a top-secret hideout. It would be perfectly natural for them to install such an apparatus.Phoenix: (Wait, come to think of it, when I was searching the rebel hideout...)Phoenix: Hm? (There's something under the banner. A microphone? What's this doing here? Was someone trying to record something with it?)Phoenix: (That was a listening device...?)Tahrust: It starts recording whenever it detects movement. And I heard just such a recording after His Magistry and his family left. If you look in the desk in my study, you will find the tape in question.Judge: All right, then... Bailiff!Bailiff: Yes, Your Magistry!Judge: Go retrieve the tape in question from the high priest's home.Bailiff: At once, Your Magistry!Nahyuta: The power of Khura'inist prayer... Even a putrid brain such as yours should understand it now.Phoenix: (It's like the contradiction really did vanish.)Judge: We shall ascertain the content of the recording once we have the tape. In the meantime, I would ask Abbot Inmee to continue with his testimony.Tahrust: Very well.Witness Testimony-- I Heard Everything --Tahrust: I was entertaining His Magistry and his family when the crime occurred. When I listened to the tape later, I heard a man and a woman quarreling. It sounded like an altercation between Acolyte Zeh'lot and Acolyte Fey. After that, there was a loud noise, followed by haunting silence.Phoenix: (I have to find some way to attack his alibi. If only Maya were here... She has a way of putting me at ease. But seeing her like this is only creeping me out!)Nahyuta: Though the high priest was a rebel, he was still a Khura'inist holy man. Therefore, take care in your questioning, lest you invoke the ire of our people.Gallery:How dare he suspect the high priest! May the Holy Mother strike him blind.Phoenix: (As if this wasn't hard enough already...)

If so, there's nothing that would lead you to believe he had experienced a heavy feeling.Tahrust: ..................Phoenix: The fact is, of course, a stone slab did fall over onto Acolyte Zeh'lot... ...impaling him on the warbaa'd statue behind him. But that was only revealed through Her Benevolence's Divination S\u00e9ance earlier.Judge: Hmm. Would the defense please get to the point?Phoenix: My point is, simply hearing a crashing sound... ...shouldn't have automatically led him to conclude the victim was crushed to death.Judge: I still don't see your point.Phoenix: I'm saying that the high priest knew. He knew how the victim was really killed!Judge: Why...!Phoenix: And that is information only the real killer could've known!Tahrust: !Phoenix: (I-I definitely saw it that time! I've got the high priest's spirit shaking in his boots -- or should I say, sandals!)Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Need I remind you Abbot Inmee was with His Magistry at the time of the crime. Such an alibi precludes him from being the killer!Phoenix: (That's true. So he can't be the killer. However, he knew how Zeh'lot was killed -- something only the killer could know. Can this discrepancy be resolved somehow?)Judge: Well, Mr. Wright?! We're waiting for an explanation!Phoenix: ...I was just getting to that. (Time to think of something quick!) The high priest knew something only the killer could've known because...He heard it during the trial Phoenix: He heard it during this trial. Judge: How could that be? The true cause of death came to light before Abbot Inmee came back to this world. Phoenix: Oh... Umm, well then maybe... Judge: Let me stop you right there before you waste any more time with your inane excuses. Phoenix: (Guess I couldn't have wiggle my way out of that one.) Judge: If you're going to make such a bold claim, I insist you back it up. Phoenix: Don't worry, I'm going to do just that. Leads back to: \"The high priest knew something only the killer could've known because...\"He inferred it after the fact Phoenix: Maybe he figured it out later. After all, we figured it out. He could have, too! Tahrust: W-Why, yes, it is as the lawyer says. Judge: Hmm. You are stating the obvious... and negating your own point, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Oh, umm... Oops? L-Let's pretend that never happened! Judge: Then you shouldn't have brought it up in the first place! Phoenix: (Urk! Now I'm really on His Magistry's bad side.) Judge: If you're going to make such a bold claim, I insist you back it up. Phoenix: Don't worry, I'm going to do just that. Leads back to: \"The high priest knew something only the killer could've known because...\"He heard it from the real culprit Leads to: \"He must've heard how the victim died from... umm...\"Phoenix: He must've heard how the victim died from... umm... ...from the real killer!Tahrust: Hrrrrrrrrmm? The real killer?Phoenix: (Of course! That makes perfect sense. I don't want to believe it, but this is the only possible explanation.)Judge: So, tell us! Who is this real killer?!Phoenix: (It's gotta be someone close to the high priest... Someone without an alibi... The person most likely to be Zeh'lot's killer is...!)Present Beh'leeb Inmee profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Your Magistry, while you were visiting the high priest's home..\"Present anyone else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is who really killed Puhray Zeh'lot! Judge: ..................... Phoenix: ...On second thought, I changed my mind. Judge: You are free to change your mind, but that won't change your punishment! Phoenix: (That was pretty sloppy. The high priest has an ironclad alibi. But was there someone who didn't?) Judge: I expect a serious answer this time, defense. Who do you believe is the real killer?! Leads back to: \"The person most likely to be Zeh'lot's killer is...!\"Phoenix: Your Magistry, while you were visiting the high priest's home... ...you didn't see Mrs. Inmee at all, did you?Judge: No, I never saw her, but... Wh-What does that have to do with anything?Phoenix: Did the high priest ever leave your sight?Judge: No, we were talking the entire time. And the food was brought right to the room's entryway.Phoenix: So, the high priest has an ironclad alibi. But his wife does not!Nahyuta: What the devil are you insinuating?Phoenix: I'm insinuating that Mrs. Inmee might have killed Acolyte Zeh'lot!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: You have a lot of nerve, making such a baseless allegation. She had no motive to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot. He was like family to her.Phoenix: No... We can't entirely discount the idea. Especially if you consider that... ...Mrs. Inmee could've been the one posing as Lady Kee'ra.Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Even a fool must temper his foolishness at times. Or do you truly believe Lady Kee'ra would kill Acolyte Zeh'lot, though he was not a rebel?Phoenix:Phoenix: As we all know, the high priest was secretly a rebel! It would follow that his favorite disciple could very well be a rebel, too!Judge: A-Are you suggesting that Mrs. Inmee killed her husband, as well?Phoenix: As sad as it is to think she'd kill her own husband to rid the kingdom of rebels... ...I don't think we can rule it out.Tahrust:Tahrust: ............... KAAAAAAAAAH!Phoenix: Urk!Judge: Yikes!Tahrust: You claim my wife is that rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra? And that she slew both Zeh'lot and myself? My lovely wife?! That is utterly impossible! KAAAAAAAAAH!Phoenix: Urk!Judge: Yikes! I have never seen the high priest so angry!Nahyuta: It is as Abbot Inmee stated. And the accused has already been found guilty of his murder. It is far too late to overturn it.Judge: Th-That's right, Mr. Wright! N-Now apologize to the good priest before he gets angry again! Quickly now!Phoenix: No, I'm not going to apologize! The true identity of Lady Kee'ra is a major piece to this trial's puzzle! Admit it, Abbot Inmee -- your wife, Lady Inmee, killed you. Yet even now, you continue to lie in an effort to protect her.Tahrust:Tahrust: How absurd! It appears the lawyer has forgotten. My lovely wife could not possibly battle the rebels in the guise of Lady Kee'ra. For we were blessed by Her Holiness and she is with child! Praise be to the Holy Mother!Phoenix: (Ack, I completely forgot about that.)Tahrust: That abominable Lady Kee'ra figure who slew me and Acolyte Zeh'lot was the accused!Phoenix: (This is bad, but I can't give up now!) D-Don't forget! My client doesn't have the strength to fight rebels, either!Tahrust: ..................Phoenix: How could a weak young woman like her possibly...Nahyuta:Nahyuta: You foolish oaf of a lawyer. If only you were as blessed as Lady Inmee.Phoenix: What?Nahyuta: Surely, the accused possesses the strength -- or should I say, the power. ...The power to battle those black-hearted rebels.Phoenix: Wh-What are you talking about?Tahrust: ...My good prosecutor, I see you have come to the same conclusion as I. Such keen insight!Nahyuta: Then you have figured it out as well, Abbot Inmee? May I ask you to explain it to this putrid-brained lawyer?Tahrust: Certainly. For I cannot allow him to frame my lovely wife for murder! Foreign devil! Your Magistry, allow me to testify as to how Maya Fey is that murderous Lady Kee'ra!Judge: W-Well, if it would assuage your anger... ...then by all means, please testify!Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey is Lady Kee'ra --Tahrust: Acolyte Fey channeled Lady Kee'ra's spirit. She is a spirit medium who knows Lady Kee'ra's true name, so she could have done it. So, it was the real Lady Kee'ra who returned to root out the rebels among us. She attacked and killed me with a strength far beyond any mortal woman.Phoenix: B-But...Nahyuta: Do you understand now? Murder by spirit channeling explains everything. This is the only way the accused could have defeated one rebel after another!Tahrust: Indeed, I am a living... or shall I say \"dead\" proof of her terrible power.Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaaagh! (Maya's ability to channel spirits... It's come back to haunt her!)Nahyuta: Now, is it not time to let it go, and move on, defense?Phoenix: No, never! I'll never give up! (Now what? Think, think...! How can I prove that Maya couldn't have channeled Lady Kee'ra?!)Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- Maya Fey is Lady Kee'ra --Tahrust: Acolyte Fey channeled Lady Kee'ra's spirit.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: My client channeled Lady Kee'ra? Isn't that a little far-fetched? Tahrust: Far-fetched, you say? Why, the very fact that I am here proves she has the power to channel spirits. Phoenix: Argh... B-But you've no proof she actually channeled Lady Kee'ra. Tahrust: Oh, but I do.Tahrust: She is a spirit medium who knows Lady Kee'ra's true name, so she could have done it.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: While it's true she may be capable of channeling Lady Kee'ra... ...I doubt there's any proof she actually did. Tahrust: We are talking about the infamous \"rebel hunter\" here. That modern-day Lady Kee'ra has captured many a rebel all by herself. And among them have been more than a few great warriors.  Who but the real Lady Kee'ra could have accomplished such a feat? Judge: ...Hmm, it would be difficult for a mere mortal. That leaves the real Lady Kee'ra of legend as the only likely answer. Tahrust: Indeed! Is this not proof enough that the real Lady Kee'ra of legend had been channeled? Phoenix: (The real Lady Kee'ra of legend. That's an oxymoron if I ever heard one. Then again, the people of Khura'in believe legends to be true.)Present Tome of Secrets Phoenix: Leads to: \"The Tome of Secrets is only given to the priestess who performs the Purification Rite.\"Tahrust: So, it was the real Lady Kee'ra who returned to root out the rebels among us.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Lady Kee'ra is an actual person? Do you really believe there ever was a woman that powerful? One capable of battling rebels much bigger and stronger than herself? Tahrust: There is no way to prove that. But to doubt the existence of Lady Kee'ra is to doubt Khura'inism itself. It is not for us to question. We must simply believe. Gallery: Yeah! How dare you doubt our legends?!You'll regret saying that, you pohlkunan! Lady Kee'ra's gonna strike you down! Phoenix: Ulp! (I won't get anywhere until I can refute their claims with some evidence!)Tahrust: She attacked and killed me with a strength far beyond any mortal woman.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A strength far beyond any mortal woman? And just how strong would that be? Tahrust: You need but look at the wound she inflicted upon my body. ...Though I had hoped to never have to think about that again. Phoenix: Your wound...? (It was pretty deep, and there was a tremendous amount of blood.) Tahrust: And while Acolyte Zeh'lot was rather small in stature, he was strong. Nevertheless, he was no match for the sheer strength of Lady Kee'ra.Phoenix: (Maya's spirit channeling is proof that she's Lady Kee'ra? This is not good! I'll have to prove she didn't channel the original Lady Kee'ra!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Ahlbi Ur'gaid\nDescription: My guide.

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of information from the game, specifically the case \"The Rite of Turnabout\" from Phoenix Wright: Spirit of Justice. The task is to find which evidence contradicts a specific testimony. The testimonies given are from Tahrust Inmee, claiming that Maya Fey channeled Lady Kee'ra's spirit to kill him with superhuman strength.\n\nLooking at the evidence list, the Tome of Secrets (Evidence 23) is crucial here. The Tome states that to channel Lady Kee'ra, one must know her true name, which is Ihmsan. However, Maya's Tome of Secrets would have the correct name, but if the channeling requires knowing the true name, and the real Lady Kee'ra's name is different from what's in the Tome, that could be a contradiction.\n\nWait, in the testimony, Tahrust says Maya knows Lady Kee'ra's true name, so she could channel her. But the Tome of Secrets reveals that the true name is Ihmsan, which Maya would know. But if the real Lady Kee'ra's name is different, then channeling wouldn't work. Alternatively, maybe the Tome's name is incorrect, meaning Maya couldn't have channeled the real Lady Kee'ra. Therefore, the Tome of Secrets (Evidence 23) contradicts the testimony that Maya knew the true name and thus could channel her. That would mean the testimony about her knowing the true name (Testimony 1) is contradicted by the Tome's actual content. Wait, no. The Tome says the name is Ihmsan, so if Maya used that name, she could channel. But if the real Lady Kee'ra's name is different, then even knowing the Tome's name wouldn't allow proper channeling. But in the game's context, the Tome's name is correct, so Maya could have used it. Hmm, maybe another angle.\n\nWait, another thought: The Tome of Secrets states that the priestess must know Lady Kee'ra's name and have seen her face. The testimony says Maya knew the name, but if the Tome's name is incorrect or there's more to it, maybe there's a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the real Lady Kee'ra's name is different from what's in the Tome, meaning Maya couldn't have channeled the real one. But according to the evidence, the Tome lists the name as Ihmsan. If that's the correct name, then the testimony's claim that Maya could channel her is valid. But maybe the Tome's name isn't the real one, hence the contradiction. Wait, in the game's story, the Tome's name is actually a fake, and the real name is Amara, the former queen. So Maya using the Tome's name (Ihmsan) wouldn't actually summon the real Lady Kee'ra (Amara), thus contradicting the testimony that she could channel her. Therefore, the Tome of Secrets (Evidence 23) would contradict Testimony 1, where Tahrust claims Maya knew the true name. Because the Tome's name is not the real one, so even if Maya used it, she couldn't have channeled the real Lady Kee'ra, thus contradicting the claim that she did."

After clearing \"Enguarde's past\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Hotel Lobby and clearing \"Big scoop\" Talk option upon breaking Psyche-Locks in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway: March 21Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe said they had an investigation briefing... Pearl: Yeah... Oh! He's back! Gumshoe: Hey, so you came, pal. Phoenix: Why the blunt greeting? Gumshoe: Um, because there's nothing to be friendly or happy about. Phoenix: What do you mean by that? Gumshoe: Well, things look perfect this time around. The evidence and testimony are airtight... Phoenix: But... But... We can't just roll over and die! We have to stay positive! Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Freeze! Police! Everyone against the wall, hands where I can see 'em! Hey, what are you doing, Gumshoe!? Their hands, not yours!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for arrests. Talk Airtight evidence Phoenix: So what do you mean the evidence is airtight...? Gumshoe: I can't give you all the details, pal, but there's two big pieces. Pearl: T-Two!? Gumshoe: And both of them are in this photo. The first is the button that's missing from the victim's chest. Phoenix: Hmm... That's the button that you found during your body search of Mr. Engarde... Gumshoe: Yup. I found it in the folds of the Nickel Samurai's special pants. Phoenix: Um... Uh... And the second one is...? Gumshoe: The knife in his chest, pal. The fingerprints on the knife in his chest, to be exact. Pearl: Fingerprints...? Um... Whose are they? Gumshoe: You didn't even have to ask, little missy. It's obvious. They're Matt Engarde's. Phoenix: ... (Tomorrow's trial... Talk about being stuck between a rock and a hard place...) Airtight testimony Phoenix: So what about this \"airtight testimony\"...? Gumshoe: It's that old security lady, Ms. Oldbag. Phoenix: I thought so... Gumshoe: What do you mean, you thought so? Did she tell you something, pal? Phoenix: Um, well... Gumshoe: And I even told her not to open that mouth of hers and blab to anyone... Phoenix: (Her blab knob is stuck on ten, and there's no turning it down... Trust me.) Gumshoe: Yeah, well... Ms. Oldbag saw it all, pal. She saw Mr. Engarde come out of the victim's room around the estimated time of death. Pearl: N-No way! Celeste Inpax (appears after presenting Magazine Clipping) Leads to: \"She was the victim's manager and was also Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor.\" Present Guitar Case Phoenix: What can you tell me about this guitar case...? Gumshoe: Oh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item. Pearl: But... The guitar wasn't in his hotel room... Gumshoe: Yeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show. Phoenix: (It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...) Wine Glass Gumshoe: The stuff in that glass is tomato juice, pal. Phoenix: Tomato juice... Gumshoe: I heard the victim really loved that stuff. Favorite drink in the world. Phoenix: ...It was his favorite drink? (First time I've heard that...) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: We're pretty interested in this bit of gossip ourselves. Phoenix: The scandal with Mr. Corrida? But why? Gumshoe: Well, two years ago... A woman committed suicide. Pearl: Suicide... Gumshoe: Her name was Celeste Inpax. And she was Juan Corrida's manager. Phoenix: The victim's manager...? Gumshoe: But that's not all, pal. Ms. Inpax was Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor... She taught Ms. Andrews everything she knew about the business from square one. Pearl: Her mentor... Phoenix: (A woman who was both Mr. Corrida's manager and Ms. Andrews' mentor... Could her suicide have something to do with this case...?) Gumshoe: Do you want to know more about her, pal? Juan Corrida profile Gumshoe: I'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are. Juan Corrida, though, he was always desperately trying to be better than Matt Engarde. Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: There's something interesting about this woman, pal. Phoenix: And what is that? Gumshoe: You don't know? Haven't you heard the gossip about her? Phoenix: (Gossip, huh... I wonder if he knows anything about that article...) Anything else Gumshoe: If I'm caught leaking info to you here in the precinct, my neck's gonna be in a ringer, pal. Pearl: Y-Your neck!? No! Gumshoe: Ah, I mean my \"neck\" as a joke... But yeah, ask me about things that have to do with the case only, alright pal? Gumshoe: She was the victim's manager and was also Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor. It's been two years since her suicide, and now those two are linked again by another death. Or maybe it's just a coincidence...? But... Waaah! von Karma: I'm getting sick of dealing with one foolish idiot after another... Gumshoe: M-M-Ms. von Karma! von Karma: You can't seem to stop allying yourself with the enemy, can you? I don't need a traitor in my midst. Gumshoe: Y-Y-You don't... You don't mean... von Karma: I do. Scruffy. You have thirty minutes to get out of here. You are no longer needed. Good bye. Pearl: Th-That's... Gumshoe: W-Wait... Please wait, sir! If I don't get this month's pay, I'll star-- von Karma: Quiet! If it weren't for traitors like you... ???: \"I would've won.\" Is that what you want to say? von Karma: ...! Wh-Who!? Phoenix: That voice... E-Edgeworth!! Edgeworth: It's been a long time... Wright. Pearl: Th-This person... This is Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: What am I going to do with you...? Still blaming others when things go wrong? You haven't changed a bit, Franziska. von Karma: ... ... ... Y... You... How dare you show your face to me without a shred of shame upon it!? You've soiled the Von Karma name, dragged it through the mud... (Changed from [You've soiled the Von Karma name and dragged it through the mud.] in the original release) You even ran away with your tail between your legs like the ill-bred dog you are! (Changed from [Run away with your tail between your legs like the ill-bred dog you are!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Are you talking about the Von Karma family creed? \"To be perfect in every way...\" Then let's hear it, Franziska. How are things going? I hear you are having a rough time maintaining perfection in this country. von Karma: Y-You! Edgeworth: You seem to be getting crushed under the weight of it all. That's why I came back. von Karma: Keep your assumptions to yourself! I... I haven't given in yet! I won't lose! This case is mine! I'll never hand it over to you! Never! Mr. Phoenix Wright! I will see you tomorrow... In court. It will be a clinical lesson on the meaning of \"total victory\"! Edgeworth: Hmph. Still the same wild mare she always was. Phoenix: ... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hang in there! You'll be OK, buddy! You're not injured that badly! A hang nail isn't... ...H-Hey. Gumshoe! GUMSHOE! GUMSHOOOOOOOOOE!!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for when a fellow officer is injured. Talk Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: I thought you, the Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, had gone and died! Pearl: Mr. Nick! Phoenix: I... I never wanted to see you again! Edgeworth: I think that's enough of a \"warm welcome\" for someone you haven't seen in a year... Phoenix: Are you going to run tomorrow's trial...? Edgeworth: ...You heard her, right? That wild mare hasn't given in yet, it seems. So, no, I don't think I'll be making an appearance. Pearl: ... Edgeworth: Your hatred for me is quite unhealthy. Not to mention one-sided. But I will say one thing... Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: You can't win on your own at the trial tomorrow. Phoenix: (What is that supposed to mean...?) Edgeworth: I have something definitive that you lack. And working together is the definition of teamwork. It's the power to find the truth. (Changed from [And that's the definition of teamwork. It's the power to find the truth.] in the original release) Phoenix: \"The truth\"...? Edgeworth: In order to understand this case, you have to understand a certain \"truth\". ...Well, if you ever feel the need for my assistance, it is available to you. I'm not in charge of this case, so I can be a bit more generous with information. Phoenix: (Just what is going on inside his head...?) \"Proof of Von Karma blood\" Edgeworth: A lot of things may have happened, however Manfred von Karma was still my mentor. And a \"perfect win record\" is proof of a Von Karma. Phoenix: ...One year ago, you could not establish guilt in a few cases... Are those losses the reason you suddenly disappeared from the Prosecutor's Office? Did you leave because you had lost your \"perfect win record\"...? Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: To think your motivation for prosecuting trials was so selfish... It'd been better for everyone if you never came back from the dead, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ... I see. Then let me ask you something. Why do YOU stand in the courtroom? What is your reason? Why stand in court? (appears after \"\"Proof of Von Karma blood\"\") Phoenix: Well, with Franziska, she almost always says, (Changed from [Well, if it was Franziska, she would almost definitely say,] in the original release) von Karma: \"I will defeat you this time!\" the instant she sees me. (Changed from ['I will defeat you this time!' the instant she saw me.] in the original release) Phoenix: But... The courtroom is not a personal battlefield for prosecutors and lawyers. I stand in the courtroom to defend my client. ...To save their lives. Edgeworth: To save your client, you say? Phoenix: Those who think only of their own ego-driven goals... Those kind of prosecutors are reprehensible to me. Even if you're a \"prodigy\"... Or someone like you, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ... It looks like there is still a lot you have yet to learn. Phoenix: \"A lot I have yet to learn\"? Me...? Edgeworth: ...Hmph. Well, that's enough for now. The time when you will see is coming soon enough... Missing suicide note (appears after presenting Celeste Inpax profile) Edgeworth: Ms. Inpax's death was most certainly a suicide. Of that there is no mistake. However, we could not find her suicide note. That's when the police began to suspect that someone had hidden it. Phoenix: The suicide note? But how do you know Ms. Inpax had even written such a note? Edgeworth: There was no solid evidence, however... We did find traces of ink on her right index finger. Which makes the likelihood of a suicide note very high. Phoenix: But who would hide such a thing...? Edgeworth: The police think it was Mr. Juan Corrida himself. Phoenix: Th-The victim...? Edgeworth: He was the one who found her body. Which makes him the only person who had a chance to hide her suicide note. Phoenix: (Mr. Corrida hid his own manager's suicide note...? But why...?) Edgeworth: As long as her note is missing, any speculation beyond this is meaningless... For now, I think you should look this over. This is the suicide report... Part one anyway... Phoenix: (Part one...?) Suicide Report added to the Court Record. Missing suicide note (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Ms. Inpax's death was most certainly a suicide. Of that there is no mistake. However, we could not find her suicide note. That's when the police began to suspect that someone had hidden it. Phoenix: The suicide note? But how do you know Ms. Inpax had even written such a note?

Edgeworth: As long as her note is missing, any speculation beyond this is meaningless... For now, I think you should look this over. This is the suicide report... Part one anyway... Phoenix: (Part one...?) \"Dependent nature\" (Changed from ['Co-dependency'] in the original release) (appears after presenting Suicide Report) Phoenix: What's this about Ms. Andrews having a \"dependent nature\"? (Changed from [So, how are 'Adrian Andrews' and 'co-dependency' related?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Adrian Andrews' attempt at suicide... was a few days after the death of Celeste Inpax. Phoenix: And...? Edgeworth: And why did Adrian Andrews think about committing suicide...? Because she had apparently \"lost her will to live.\" (Changed from [Quite possibly because she had 'lost her will to live.'] in the original release) Phoenix: Lost her will...? But why would she...? Edgeworth: Her pillar of strength, her mentor Celeste Inpax, was gone forever. That's why. Phoenix: Wh-Why would that...? Pearl: Is this what they call, \"following someone to the grave\"...? Edgeworth: After her attempted suicide, Adrian Andrews started attending counseling sessions. She is someone who needs a person in whom she can trust absolutely. (Changed from [She is a person who looks for someone she can trust unconditionally.] in the original release) And once she finds that person, she'll do anything she can to keep them near. (Changed from [And once she finds that someone, she blindly follows them.] in the original release) Without such an anchor in her life, her crippling anxiety stifles her ability to live.

And that's... that's the nature of her dependency on others? (Changed from [And that's... That's her 'co-dependency'...?] in the original release) Edgeworth: When Celeste Inpax suddenly committed suicide, the world before her turned pitch dark... That's according to Adrian Andrews herself. Phoenix: Then... That means her super-confident attitude... Edgeworth: It's all a fa\u00e7ade. She's only copying her mentor's behavior to hold herself together. Phoenix: (How terrible...) Attempted Suicide Report added to the Court Record. \"Dependent nature\" (Changed from ['Co-dependency'] in the original release) (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this about Ms. Andrews having a \"dependent nature\"?

She's only copying her mentor's behavior to hold herself together. Phoenix: (How terrible...) Present Suicide Report Edgeworth: I don't like to look through reports. I like suicide reports even less. Worst of all are the reports that have multiple parts like that one. That has two. Phoenix: ...Two parts? Edgeworth: What you just handed me is the first part of the report... Here is the second part. Phoenix: (The second part of the report is about an attempted suicide...) The attempter's name...! It's \"Adrian Andrews\"! Pearl: M-Ms. Andrews...? Um, what did she do? Phoenix: She... She tried to kill herself...? She doesn't seem like the kind of person to try to kill herself, though... (Changed from [She doesn't seem like the kind of person to try and kill herself...] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think she's a strong career woman? That's just what she wants you to think. (Changed from [You think she's a strong career woman? That is just her image.] in the original release) Adrian Andrews... She has a certain secret she's always trying to hide. Pearl: A secret...? Edgeworth: ...Her \"dependent nature\". That's what she's really like on the inside. (Changed from [...Her 'co-dependency'. That's the key word.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews? \"Dependent\"...? Talk about the exact opposite of what that woman is...) (Changed from ['Co-dependency'... The word most unsuited to describing that woman...] in the original release) Attempted Suicide Report Edgeworth: Appearances can be deceiving. It's such a clich\u00e9 saying... But it's clich\u00e9 because it's true. Phoenix: Ms. Andrews... (To think that behind that unwavering, brave front... She's been hiding this weakness in fear...) Juan Corrida profile Edgeworth: There is an interesting rumor about this man... Phoenix: You mean the one about Ms. Andrews getting close to him? But that's pretty common tabloid fare, isn't it? Edgeworth: I don't take things at face value when there's more to be found... Matt Engarde profile Edgeworth: While I was abroad, these deplorable types of actors became popular, I take it. Phoenix: Well, \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" is his motto... Edgeworth: \"R-Refreshing\"!? And what is so refreshing about a spring breeze!? Phoenix: (Sounds like the pollen is not treating him well this year...) Adrian Andrews profile Edgeworth: Adrian Andrews... She holds a large secret within herself. Phoenix: A secret...? Edgeworth: You can't help but feel that this whole case revolves around her... Celeste Inpax profile Edgeworth: Hmm... This woman is another key to solving this case. (Changed from [Hmm... This woman is another key to the case.] in the original release) Phoenix: D-Do you really think so? Edgeworth: She was Adrian Andrews' mentor a long time ago, but she was suddenly called away by a different show, and became Juan Corrida's manager. (Changed from [but suddenly, she was called away by a production, and became Juan Corrida's manager.] in the original release) And then, a few months later... Celeste Inpax died. Phoenix: B-But her death was ruled a suicide, right? (Changed from [B-But her death was a suicide, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Yes. But there is still one riddle we've yet to solved... [sic] (Changed from [But there is still one riddle left unsolved...] in the original release) Phoenix: A riddle...? Edgeworth: Her suicide note. It went missing. No one could find it. Phoenix: (A suicide note that just vanished, huh...) Any other evidence Edgeworth: I have no interest in talking about useless evidence. Put a little more thought into what you show me... Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (Still as stuck up as ever...) Any other profile Edgeworth: We are looking into leads, but we can only look into a few key players with our limited resources. There's no reason for us to waste our energy investigating this person. Phoenix: (Why don't you just tell it to me straight and say, \"I don't have any info\"?) Detention Center Present Celeste Inpax profile Engarde: ... Phoenix: ...? Engarde: ... Pearl: Um... What's wrong? Engarde: How much do you know...? Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean \"how much\"...? Engarde: ...Mr. Lawyer. I may be your client... But... I hope you will keep yourself out of my personal life. Phoenix: A-Ah, no, I would never... Engarde: ... ... Now, if you'll excuse me... I have a lunch appointment I have to keep... Phoenix: (You're in DETENTION! Who in the world are you going to eat with!? The security guard!?) Pearl: Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: This Celeste Inpax lady...

I guess we'll have to come back later. After clearing \"\"Dependent nature\"\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: March 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room Pearl: ...Oh! Ms. Andrews is here. But it looks like she's talking with someone... Phoenix: (That's... Franziska von Karma!) Pearl: Ms. von Karma...? von Karma: What are you doing here!? Phoenix: Um, well, you see... I'm his lawyer, so... von Karma: You've got some nerve, following me around... Phoenix: Following you...? Pearl: Th-That's you, Ms. von Karma! You're the one doing the following! Phoenix: Pearls... Pearl: You're always following after that Mr. Detective with the little beard! von Karma: ...Me? Following after Scruffy...? Don't make me laugh. Let me show you something interesting... little girl. (Changed from [I'll show you something interesting... little girl.] in the original release) ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... Pearl: Wh-What is that? von Karma: An electromagnetic receiver. I planted a tracking device on that detective. And with this, I know that fool's every move. Phoenix: (So that noise we heard was this receiver... I feel really sorry for poor Detective Gumshoe now...) von Karma: Now then... Let's stop wasting time. Adrian Andrews!

If you ask me, I think you know the reason he was killed. Andrews: Hmm... Phoenix: Why are you hiding things? Don't you realize you're putting Mr. Engarde's life in danger by your actions? Andrews: ... Why do you ask questions for which I have no answers? The truth is, I was not that close to Mr. Corrida. Phoenix: You were not that close...? Andrews: That's right. I've never been good at being intimate with another person. Phoenix: You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that. Present Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Leads to: \"You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: I'm very bad at connecting with people. They're so depressing for the most part. Phoenix: Um... Andrews: But I especially dislike feeble-minded individuals. Phoenix: Yes, well... Andrews: That's why I don't think I could ever be intimate with you. Phoenix: (So... I guess she's saying I'm both depressing and stupid...?) But I am certain you were very close with the victim. Andrews: Say that all you like, but you still don't have any proof. Leads to: \"You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that.\" Phoenix: You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...? Andrews: ... A silly third-rate tabloid article. If you even had half your wits about you, you wouldn't believe such rubbish. Phoenix: Well, it seems quite a few people bought into this story. Andrews: Hmph. As to be expected in a world filled with crooks and liars. Phoenix: (...Note to self: Stay on her good side.) Andrews: In any case, I despise interpersonal relationships like that. Phoenix: I see... However... What if there was a need for you to get close to someone...? Andrews: Me? Need to get close to Mr. Corrida? As if there was ever such a need. Phoenix: Didn't you get close to Mr. Corrida for this person's sake...?

Andrews: It's not in my nature to enjoy doing things for others. Phoenix: B-But... You're a manager... Andrews: It's called a job. I am in charge of Mr. Engarde the star, not Matt Engarde the man. Phoenix: O-Oh. Andrews: And you are not my client. Phoenix: (Is this my subtle hint to \"go home\"...?) But... I know you must have had a need to get close to the victim. Leads back to: \"Me? Need to get close to Mr. Corrida? As if there was ever such a need.\" Phoenix: Celeste Inpax, your mentor. Andrews: How do you know about Celeste!? (Changed from [Why do you know about Celeste!?] in the original release) 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Ms. Inpax... She committed suicide, didn't she? Andrews: ... Phoenix: But it looks like no one knows why. Right before her death, she was Juan Corrida's manager. So, I believe you got close to Mr. Corrida so you could find out more about her suicide. Andrews: ...Y-You have a great imagination. You may have a future yet as a slimy muckraker for a putrid third-rate tabloid! Phoenix: M-Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: Th-There was no mystery surrounding her death. None. It would be pointless for me to force myself into a relationship for nothing! Phoenix: (Is that really true...? Was there really no mystery at all?) I don't believe you were completely at ease with the way her suicide was resolved! Present Suicide Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Ms. Inpax's suicide note was never found, was it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: Get a hold of yourself. Phoenix: Huh?

Leads back to: \"Th-There was no mystery surrounding her death. None.\" Phoenix: ...Ms. Inpax's suicide note was never found, was it? Andrews: ...! Phoenix: It looks like the police were under the suspicion that someone had hidden it. Like maybe the person who discovered her body, Mr. Corrida. Andrews: J... Juan? Phoenix: And, Ms. Andrews, I believe you thought the same thing! That is why you became intimate with Mr. Corrida! 1 LOCK BROKEN Andrews: I-I've sat by quietly and listened to your insulting ramblings long enough! Phoenix: ... Andrews: It's true that Celeste was my mentor, however, allow me to say this again: It had nothing to do with me! I didn't even know that her suicide note was never found! I'm a person who doesn't care about what goes on in the lives of others! Phoenix: (That's the impression you like to give, however...) I don't think that's who you really are. Andrews: What? Phoenix: I have evidence that says otherwise. This is proof that Celeste Inpax was someone very special to you... Present Attempted Suicide Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Andrews... You... You nearly went through with it too, didn't you?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, how about it, Ms. Andrews? Andrews: I'm sure even those among your lawyer colleagues find it hard to hate you. Phoenix: ...? Andrews: They probably pity you. After all, you are dangerously close to being a failure. Phoenix: \"Pity\"...? Andrews: Although, thanks to your little spectacle, I feel much better about myself. Phoenix: (*sigh* This evidence isn't strong enough to give up the truth.) Andrews: ...By now, even someone like you should understand. Leads back to: \"I'm a person who doesn't care about what goes on in the lives of others!\" Phoenix: Ms. Andrews... You... You nearly went through with it too, didn't you? (Changed form [Ms. Andrews... You... You went through it too, didn't you?] in the original release) Andrews: Went through with what? (Changed from [Went through what?] in the original release) Phoenix: Ending your life. (Changed from [A suicide.] in the original release) Andrews: ...! Phoenix: Ms. Andrews, you look and act like a very strong woman who has it all together. You don't ask for anyone's help, relying only on yourself. (Changed from [You don't ask for anyone's help and you live by yourself.] in the original release) Andrews: Y-Yes. I've been very independent ever since I can remember... Phoenix: However, that is all just a lie. A fa\u00e7ade. Andrews: ... Phoenix: You've always searched out people on whom you can depend on. Andrews: Th-That's...! Phoenix: You were dependent on Ms. Inpax, weren't you? Which is why... When she passed away, you lost everything you had. Andrews: S-Stop! 1 LOCK BROKEN Andrews: ... When Celeste passed away so suddenly like that... I died a death of my own. But... No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop thinking about what had become of her note. Phoenix: You must have heard about the police report... The one that said the police suspected Mr. Corrida of hiding Ms. Inpax's note... You heard about it, and thought to recover it from him by getting close, am I right? Andrews: ... Phoenix: If that's the case, then everything changes. Andrews: Wh-What do you mean? Phoenix: What topic did we start this conversation on again? Andrews: It was \"why was the victim killed\"... Phoenix: Exactly. Somehow, Ms. Andrews... It seems that you have become the one with a reason to want Mr. Corrida dead... (Changed from [It seems that you have become the one most likely to want Mr. Corrida dead...] in the original release) Andrews: M-Me...? Phoenix: Ms. Inpax was everything to you. ...And then she died. And you would do anything to find out why she killed herself. ...Even commit murder. Andrews: Murder...!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Andrews: It's true. I am a woman who can only live in insecurity. I'm physically small, and I don't really have a lot of self-confidence. I've pushed against all that, though... I've tried to live strongly. I never wanted anyone to find out the truth... Pearl: Ms. Andrews... Andrews: This one thing... It's the one thing I wanted to take with me to the grave... It was my secret. Mine and mine alone. Phoenix: I... I'm sorry. Andrews: You probably think I'm a worthless human being right now, don't you? Phoenix: Please, Ms. Andrews. All I want to know is the truth. Andrews: After Celeste passed away, I heard that someone had hidden her suicide note... And that someone was Juan Corrida. Celeste... Without her... Without her, I became scared. Everything... Everyone seemed like they were out to get me. Phoenix: So you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct? Andrews: ... Looks like that tabloid reported the truth after all. Ironic, isn't it? Phoenix: Well, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire. Andrews: And if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning. Pearl: ... Andrews: But as for the suicide note? I didn't and wouldn't kill anyone for it. It just doesn't suit me, that's all. Andrews: ... Well, that's enough for now. I still have work to do, so... Phoenix: I understand. Andrews: Oh, I have one small favor to ask. My... attempted suicide... I'd like for you to keep it a secret. Pearl: Ms. Andrews... Andrews: If... If people found out about my weakness... I... I would sooner choose to die than live. Phoenix: A-A-Alright! I understand! We'll keep it a secret! (Ms. Andrews... I guess she's the overthinking type... (Changed from [Ms. Andrews... I guess she's the 'always thinking' type...] in the original release) She probably never says anything without carefully thinking it through first. (Changed from [She never says anything carelessly, it seems...] in the original release)) Andrews: Thank you for your discretion. (Changed from [Thank you very much.] in the original release) Pearl: Mr. Nick... Can I ask you something...? Phoenix: What is it? Pearl: Ms. Andrews has been playing with that card in her hand since a little while back... Phoenix: (That card...? Yeah, I guess she has...) Ms. Andrews, what is that card you're holding...? Andrews: Huh? O-Oh, this? I don't quite know. It just suddenly appeared in my handbag... Phoenix: What is it? It looks like... A seashell? Andrews: That's what it looks like, doesn't it? I honestly don't remember owning this card... I wonder where I picked it up from...? Phoenix: (Her not remembering something clearly? Sounds like it would be a rare occurence.) Andrews: Well, I must be off. I leave Mr. Engarde in your \"capable\" hands. March 21Gatewater HotelHallway Phoenix: Well, I think we've gathered about all we can... Pearl: Wh-What about Mystic Maya? Is she alright...? Phoenix: (Oh, Pearls... She looks so worn out by all this... She hasn't slept at all, and has been walking all over the place with me today...) Pearl: What's wrong, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Let's go back to the office for a little while. You're really tired, right? Pearl: Oh, no! I'm OK. Really! ... I'm fine. I really am. Phoenix: (You don't look fine to me...)

Phoenix: Well, we did find one thing out for sure. Ms. Andrews has a motive. Pearl: You mean Ms. Inpax's suicide note...? Phoenix: That's right. She was also the one to discover the victim's body.

That kidnapper is one to keep his word, it seems. Phoenix: I'm glad to hear she's safe... But Mia, how did you know...? Mia: As soon as she was locked up, Maya called for me. I read the note she left... Then I gathered as much information about her surroundings as I could. Phoenix: (I didn't know you could use spirit channeling like that... Pretty smart of her...)

Gumshoe: OK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later. Phoenix: And that's when the victim's body was found, correct? Edgeworth: Which is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period. Judge: Hmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe: The victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct? Gumshoe: ...Yeah. Judge: Who is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about? Gumshoe: She's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir. Judge: Ah, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence... Gumshoe: When the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir. Judge: I see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe: After looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...? Gumshoe: Only a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana. Judge: Mmm... \"Banana\"... Gumshoe: Um, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir. Judge: Ah, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana. Phoenix: Then, what about the knife...? Gumshoe: It seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death. Judge: Hmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: The cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...? Gumshoe: Only a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana. Judge: Mmm... \"Banana\"... Gumshoe: Um, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir. Judge: Ah, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana. Phoenix: Then, what about the knife...? Gumshoe: It seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death. Judge: Hmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe: At first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you think that? Gumshoe: Because it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime. Judge: Oh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!? Gumshoe: Um, we thought of that too... But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: The only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's. Phoenix: Only the victim's, huh...? Judge: Hmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then... Guitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you think that? Gumshoe: Because it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime. Judge: Oh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!? Gumshoe: Um, we thought of that too... But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: The only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's. Phoenix: Only the victim's, huh...? Judge: Hmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe: However, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What convinced you it had nothing to do with the case? Gumshoe: The guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night. Judge: Well then, where was it? Gumshoe: The bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir. Judge: So you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...? Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar. Phoenix: So that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel... Gumshoe: Yeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all. Judge: Hmm...Mia: Our first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix: But there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia: Maybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix: If you say so...Mia: Of course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:Edgeworth: I believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge: Hmm...Edgeworth: Which brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix: (Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge: Very well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe: Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other. They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book. As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button. It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\". The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife. The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge: Hmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe: It was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe: ...And there's this button.Judge: That was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe: Yes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix: What!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge: All of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth: Yes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix: Hmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth: You can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix: Grrrrrrrrr...Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not? Gumshoe: ...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown. Phoenix: But Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end... Judge: That is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing. Edgeworth: ...Gumshoe: They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls! Gumshoe: Well, yeah, I guess, but... Phoenix: Which means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all! Judge: Hmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective? Gumshoe: Um, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired. Gumshoe: Eh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's... Edgeworth: I look forward to your pension negotiations. Gumshoe: N-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO! Judge: Now, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony. Gumshoe: *sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too... Edgeworth: Detective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir! Phoenix: (Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe: As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have any proof that button belonged to the victim? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: Oh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\". Gumshoe: Huh? But can't you tell by just looking at it? Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: A-And the victim's blood is on it. Phoenix: Anyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward. Gumshoe: ... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir! Phoenix: (Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...) Edgeworth: ...Thread. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: The button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal! Phoenix: Urk. Mia: That's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe: It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press Phoenix: Phoenix: When was this button found? Gumshoe: Pretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button. Judge: Hmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder... Edgeworth: The police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people... Phoenix: (Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe: The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How were the fingerprints arranged on the knife? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: By examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...? Gumshoe: Oh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that... Phoenix: (I can't believe the bumbling of this department...) Edgeworth: ...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder. Judge: Hmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe: The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife! Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either. Phoenix: (Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...) Mia: ...Phoenix. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: There's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wait a second!\"Phoenix: (A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia: Be grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix: We're still in a world of trouble...Mia: Well, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Pearl Fey\nDescription: Maya's cousin.

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, looking at the testimonies provided by Gumshoe, he claims that the Jammin' Ninja's button was ripped off the costume and found in Engarde's hakama. The relevant evidence here is the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16), which is described as being ripped from the costume and found in Engarde's hakama.\n\nBut wait, there's another piece of evidence: the Crime Photo (Evidence 9). The photo shows the victim sitting in a samurai outfit with a knife in his chest. The guitar case is on the floor, and there's a smashed vase with water on the carpet. Now, if the button was ripped off during a struggle, the Crime Photo might show the victim's costume intact, which would contradict the testimony that the button was ripped off. However, the description of the Crime Photo doesn't explicitly mention the state of the costume's buttons. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the testimony that the button was found in Engarde's hakama (Testimony 3), the evidence about the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) mentions that it was empty and had only Corrida's fingerprints. But how does that relate? Maybe not directly. \n\nWait, the testimony says the button was ripped off the costume and found in Engarde's hakama. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the cause of death was strangulation, not a struggle that would rip a button. So the button being ripped off might not align with the method of killing. However, the button is covered in blood, which could still be possible if the stabbing happened post-mortem. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) which has Andrews' fingerprints, but that's about her involvement, not directly related to the button. \n\nWait, there's the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) set to record from 8 PM. If the camera was recording, maybe the footage would show if the button was ripped off during a struggle. But the Spy Camera's footage isn't mentioned in the testimonies here. \n\nAnother angle: The Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. The testimony claims Engarde bought the knife for the crime, making it premeditated. But the Knife's description says \"Gatewater\" is engraved on the grip. If the knife is from the hotel, perhaps Engarde didn't buy it. Wait, the receipt (Evidence 24) is for a stuffed bear, not the knife. So the knife's origin isn't from Engarde's purchase. Therefore, the testimony that Engarde bought the knife for the crime (Testimony 5) might contradict the evidence that the knife is a hotel item (engraved \"Gatewater\"). So, Testimony 5 says the defendant bought the knife, but Evidence 15's engraving suggests it's hotel property. That would be a contradiction. \n\nBut the user's answer format requires the evidence and testimony numbers. Testimony 5 is about buying the knife for the crime. Evidence 15 is the Knife with \"Gatewater\" engraved. So presenting Evidence 15 against Testimony 5 would show that the knife wasn't bought by Engarde but is hotel property, contradicting the premeditation claim. \n\nSo the correct pair is Evidence 15 (Knife) and Testimony 5. But wait, the user's provided evidence list shows Evidence 15 as the Knife. So {\"evidence\":15, \"testimony\":5}. But I need to confirm the numbering. The Evidences are listed from 0 to 31. Knife is Evidence 15. Testimony 5 is the last one, which is about buying the knife. So yes, that's the contradiction. The knife's engraving from Gatewater contradicts the testimony that Engarde bought it for the crime, implying it's hotel property, thus he didn't buy it, making the premeditation claim false."

Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that... Phoenix: (I can't believe the bumbling of this department...) Edgeworth: ...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.

The defendant...Phoenix: ...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe: H-Huh!?Phoenix: Take a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe: ...Huh?Judge: It has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe: \"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix: That's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe: ... Uh oh.Phoenix: The murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge: Yes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth: Heh heh heh...Judge: Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix: What!?Edgeworth: I think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix: H-How so!?Edgeworth: I admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe: ...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth: The question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge: Wh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth: Sorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge: There is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth: If it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix: Urk...Edgeworth: Mr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge: Amazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia: It seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix: (This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge: A murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth: I can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix: (Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia: He means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge: What does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Um, well...Mia: Phoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix: (That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge: Mr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do. Leads to: \"There's one...\"No, not right now. Phoenix: (This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.) Judge: Looks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one. Edgeworth: Which means this court is adjourned. Mia: Phoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick! Phoenix: (Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!) Phoenix: Leads to: \"There's one...\"Phoenix: There's one...Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: One piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge: Mr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth: What the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix: (If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge: You may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass Phoenix: Leads to: \"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong. Judge: I can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence. Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: I am a man of my word, Mr. Wright! Infinite penaltyJudge: This... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix: Please look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge: Hmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix: However! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge: ...Gumshoe: ...Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: W-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge: Ah, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix: Y-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge: You can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: What is it, Your Honor?Judge: Your opinion...Edgeworth: ...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix: ...What!?Edgeworth: It's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge: Hmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible. Phoenix: (It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...) Mia: You can't think like that, Phoenix. Phoenix: Mia... Mia: Right now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing! Phoenix: (So in other words, push as far as we can go...) Leads to: \"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way. Phoenix: (If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!) Mia: They just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough! Leads to: \"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix: The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge: Hmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix: (There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth: Unlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix: Wh-What!?Edgeworth: You're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix: Th-Then...Edgeworth: Of course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix: Fingerprints...Edgeworth: There were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge: Only one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth: They were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix: WHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth: That is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth: Ms. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge: Hmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth: Tsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix: Grrr!Edgeworth: I've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge: W-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix: \"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth: Yes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia: What in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth: Now then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag: ...Edgeworth: ... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth: Uurrngh!Oldbag: ...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth: Grrrrrrrrr...Phoenix: (I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag: Oh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth: I saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag: I tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge: Ms... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge: Oof!Oldbag: Shush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge: Yes, madam.Edgeworth: No no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag: It's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth: The witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag: It was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge: You mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag: Look, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix: (Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag: Anyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth: Very well.

There was something I was interested in finding out, you know... Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time. That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room. It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge: Hmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag: See! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth: ...Judge: I see. Well, Mr. Wright.

Oldbag: The lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails. Phoenix: (Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...) Oldbag: Besides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little. Phoenix: And that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag: There was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Something you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that? Oldbag: It's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...? Edgeworth: I have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor. Phoenix: (\"Gossip\"...?) Edgeworth: If this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony. Mia: It looks like we shouldn't force it right now. Judge: Hmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag: Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Oh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room? Oldbag: I have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am! Judge: ...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report. Edgeworth: In any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag: That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who in the world was that!? Oldbag: I'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was... Judge: Yes...? He was...?

I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the provided story, characters, evidences, and testimonies.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies from Oldbag. She testified that Matt Engarde was seen leaving Juan Corrida's room wearing his flashy racing jacket. The key point here is the description of his clothing\u2014specifically the racing jacket.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence, there's the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) which was ripped from the victim's costume and found in Engarde's hakama. But also, there's the Security Camera Photo (Evidence 17) which shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. Wait, the Jammin' Ninja's costume would be a samurai outfit, right? So if Oldbag says Engarde was wearing his racing jacket, but the photo shows someone in samurai garb (the Jammin' Ninja costume), that's a contradiction. Because the racing jacket is different from the ninja costume. \n\nWait, in the testimony, Oldbag says Engarde was wearing his racing jacket when he left the room. But the photo (Evidence 17) shows a person in samurai garb (the Jammin' Ninja outfit) outside the door. That's a contradiction because the outfit in the photo doesn't match the racing jacket described by Oldbag. Therefore, the evidence (Lotta's Photo, which is Evidence 17) contradicts her testimony (Testimony 3 or 4). Wait, Testimony 3 is \"That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\" Testimony 4 is \"It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\" The added statement about the racing jacket is Testimony 5. But the key contradiction is between the jacket and the photo of someone in samurai garb. So Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) contradicts Testimony 5 about the jacket. But wait, the testimony about the jacket is Testimony 5: \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\" The photo (Evidence 17) shows a person in samurai garb, which is different from the racing jacket. So that's the contradiction. Therefore, the evidence is 17 (Lotta's Photo) and testimony is 5 (the racing jacket statement)."

Oldbag: That way, no one could see his face, of course! Phoenix: But there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence contradicts Oldbag's testimony. So, Oldbag is testifying that she saw the Nickel Samurai (Matt Engarde) coming out of Juan's room. She first said he was wearing his racing jacket but later changed her story to say he was in the Nickel Samurai costume. \n\nThe key contradiction here is between her testimony and the evidence. Let's look at the evidence. Evidence 15 is the Knife, which has Engarde's fingerprints. But wait, the knife might not directly relate to the costume. Then there's Evidence 16, Jammin' Ninja's Button, found in Engarde's hakama. But the button is from the Jammin' Ninja's costume, which is the victim's, not necessarily related to Oldbag's claim.\n\nWait, Oldbag's testimony says that Engarde was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume when he committed the murder. But according to the Crime Photo (Evidence 9), the victim was stabbed with a knife. However, the important point here is the time. The testimony mentions that he had to go to the post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, implying he was in costume then. But the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM for an hour. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. If the camera was running, maybe it shows something else?\n\nWait, the testimony in question is Testimony 3: \"He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\" But the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) mentions that the Nickel Samurai was to confess something after the stage show. However, the actual contradiction might be with the costume. The Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's hakama, which is part of the Nickel Samurai costume. But Oldbag says he was wearing the costume during the murder. However, the button from the victim's costume was found in Engarde's costume, suggesting a struggle or contact. Wait, but that might not directly contradict Oldbag's testimony.\n\nWait, another angle: Oldbag claims that the person she saw was in the Nickel Samurai costume (Testimony 1). But the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, which would be possible if he was in the costume. Hmm, not a contradiction. \n\nWait, the key contradiction is in Testimony 1: she saw the Nickel Samurai, but earlier she said he was wearing his racing jacket. However, after presenting the button, she changes her story. The actual contradiction is between her initial claim about the racing jacket and the later claim about the costume. But the evidence that contradicts this is the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16) which was found in Engarde's hakama. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the Spy Camera (21) might have footage that shows someone else. But the Spy Camera's footage is not directly mentioned here. \n\nWait, looking back at the story, when Phoenix presents the Jammin' Ninja's Button, Oldbag says it proves it was Engarde. But then Phoenix points out that she previously said he was wearing the racing jacket, not the costume. The button was found in Engarde's hakama (part of the Nickel Samurai costume), which suggests that he was wearing the costume. However, Oldbag initially said he was wearing the racing jacket, which contradicts the presence of the button in the costume. So the contradiction is between her testimony that he was wearing the costume (Testimony 1) and the evidence about the racing jacket. Wait, no. Wait, Oldbag's testimony changes after presenting the button. The original testimony about the racing jacket was before the button was presented, then she changes to saying he was in the costume. So the contradiction is between her original statement (racing jacket) and the fact that the button from the Jammin' Ninja was found in the costume. But in the cross-examination, when Phoenix presses on the jacket, Oldbag changes her testimony. The evidence that contradicts her initial claim about the racing jacket is the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16), which was found in the costume, implying he was in the costume, not the jacket. Wait, but the button is from the victim's costume. The button is from the Jammin' Ninja (Corrida's costume), and it was found in Engarde's hakama (part of his Nickel Samurai costume). That suggests that Engarde's costume had the button from the victim, which could indicate a struggle. But how does that contradict Oldbag's testimony? \n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is in Testimony 3: Oldbag says Engarde had to go to the post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, which is why he was in costume. However, the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) mentions that the Nickel Samurai was to confess something after the stage show. If the stage show was after the crime, but the Press Conference Ticket's timing might conflict. Wait, perhaps not. The real contradiction is that if he was in the costume during the murder (as per Oldbag), then the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) in the victim's room should have recorded someone in the Nickel Samurai costume. But the Spy Camera's footage might show something else. However, the user hasn't provided the footage details. Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit, but that's his own costume as the Jammin' Ninja. Wait, the victim was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, so if the killer was in the Nickel Samurai costume, that's possible. But how does that contradict? Maybe the Knife (Evidence 15) with Engarde's fingerprints: if he was in the costume, he would have gloves or something, but the knife has his fingerprints. Wait, but the costume might not have gloves. That could be a contradiction: if he was in the costume, why are his fingerprints on the knife? But the user's provided evidence list says the knife has Engarde's fingerprints. However, that's not directly contradicting the testimony. \n\nWait, looking back at the cross-examination after presenting the button, Phoenix points out that Oldbag initially said Engarde was wearing the racing jacket, but now says he was in the costume. The evidence that contradicts her testimony about the costume is the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16) found in Engarde's hakama. Wait, but the button is from the victim's costume, not Engarde's. So if Engarde was in his own costume (Nickel Samurai), how did the victim's button get there? That suggests that Engarde's costume came into contact with the victim's, implying a struggle. But Oldbag's testimony is that she saw the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) leaving the room. The presence of the victim's button in Engarde's costume supports that they were in contact, but doesn't directly contradict the testimony. \n\nWait, the key contradiction is between Oldbag's testimony that the person was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume (Testimony 1) and the fact that the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's hakama. Because if Engarde was in his own costume (Nickel Samurai), then the button from the victim's costume (Jammin' Ninja) shouldn't be there unless there was a struggle. But the contradiction here is that Oldbag's testimony about seeing the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) in costume is supported by the button being present, but the button actually belongs to the victim. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, when Phoenix presents the button, he points out that Oldbag initially said Engarde was wearing the racing jacket, but the button was found in his Nickel Samurai hakama. Therefore, the contradiction is between her original testimony about the jacket (which was part of the added statement) and the presence of the button in the costume. However, in the provided testimonies, the relevant testimony after the contradiction is Testimony 1: \"The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\" So the evidence (Jammin' Ninja's Button, 16) shows that the button from the victim's costume was found in Engarde's costume, which might indicate that the killer was in the victim's costume, not Engarde's. Wait, but the victim was the Jammin' Ninja, so his button in Engarde's costume suggests they had contact. But Oldbag claims she saw the Nickel Samurai (Engarde's character) leaving the room. If the killer was actually wearing the Jammin' Ninja costume (the victim's), then Oldbag's testimony is wrong. But the button is from the victim's costume, found in Engarde's. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Oldbag saw the Nickel Samurai) and Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo), which shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. If the photo shows the Jammin' Ninja (victim's costume), then that contradicts Oldbag's claim. But Evidence 17's description says the photo is of a person in samurai garb outside the door. The victim was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, so if the photo shows someone else in that costume, it could be the killer. But the testimony says it was the Nickel Samurai. However, without knowing what the photo exactly shows, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording the room. If the camera footage shows someone else, but that's not part of the evidence description here. The user-provided evidence list for the Spy Camera says it was set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour, running at the time of the murder (8:15 PM). But the contents aren't specified here. So maybe that's not the right path. \n\nWait, going back to the story: When Phoenix presents the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16), Oldbag insists it was Engarde. Phoenix then points out that she initially said Engarde was wearing his racing jacket, but the button was found in his Nickel Samurai hakama. This contradiction leads to Oldbag changing her testimony to say it was the Nickel Samurai costume. The key contradiction here is that Oldbag's original statement about the racing jacket (added to her testimony) conflicts with the presence of the button in the Nickel Samurai's costume. Therefore, the evidence is the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16), which was found in the Nickel Samurai's hakama, contradicting her earlier claim about the racing jacket. However, the testimony in question here is Testimony 1, where she now says it was the Nickel Samurai. Wait, but the added statement about the racing jacket is part of her previous testimony, which is now being contradicted by the button evidence. \n\nWait, in the cross-examination after presenting the button, Phoenix points out that Oldbag previously stated the defendant was wearing his racing jacket, but the button was found in his Nickel Samurai hakama. This shows a contradiction between her testimony (about the racing jacket) and the evidence (the button in the hakama). The testimony that's contradicted is the added statement: \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\" But in the current testimonies provided (Testimony 0-4), that added statement isn't listed. The testimonies provided are:\n\nTestimony 0: Engarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nTestimony 1: The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nTestimony 2: Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nTestimony 3: He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nTestimony 4: So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\n\nSo, the added statement about the racing jacket is part of the previous testimony, but in the current cross-examination, the relevant testimony is Testimony 1 (Nickel Samurai). The contradiction arises because Oldbag initially said he was wearing the racing jacket (now changed to the costume), but the button from the victim's costume was found in Engarde's Nickel Samurai costume, implying that the killer was in the victim's costume, not Engarde's. Wait, but the button is from the victim's costume (Jammin' Ninja), found in Engarde's costume (Nickel Samurai). That suggests that Engarde's costume came into contact with the victim's, perhaps during a struggle. However, Oldbag's testimony is that she saw the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) leaving the room. The presence of the victim's button in Engarde's costume could support that, but doesn't directly contradict. \n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is that if Engarde was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume (Testimony 1), then he couldn't have had the Jammin' Ninja's button in his hakama unless there was contact. But that's not a contradiction; it's possible. The real contradiction is that Oldbag initially claimed he was wearing the racing jacket, which contradicts the presence of the button in the Nickel Samurai costume. But in the current testimonies, she's now saying it was the costume. So the contradiction is between her previous statement (now part of her testimony) about the racing jacket and the evidence (button in the costume). However, the user-provided testimonies don't include the racing jacket statement as part of the current testimony (Testimony 0-4). The racing jacket statement was added earlier but is not part of the current cross-examination's testimonies. \n\nIn the current cross-examination, after the button is presented, the testimony is about seeing the Nickel Samurai. The contradiction here is between Testimony 1 (saw Nickel Samurai) and the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) found in Engarde's hakama. Wait, but how? The button is from the victim's costume. If the killer was in the Jammin' Ninja costume (victim's), then Oldbag's testimony that she saw the Nickel Samurai is incorrect. But the button in Engarde's costume could suggest that Engarde was in his own costume and struggled with the victim, tearing the button. However, Oldbag's testimony is that she saw the Nickel Samurai, which would be Engarde. The presence of the button from the victim's costume in Engarde's hakama supports that there was a struggle, but doesn't contradict Oldbag's testimony. \n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is that the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) recorded the murder. If the camera shows someone else, but that's not part of the evidence description here. The user hasn't provided details on the video, so maybe that's not it. \n\nWait, the real contradiction is in Testimony 3: Oldbag says Engarde had to go to the post-ceremony stage show right after the crime. The Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) says the Nickel Samurai was to confess something after the stage show. If the stage show was after the murder, then Engarde would have had to be in costume for the show, which aligns with Oldbag's testimony. But the real contradiction is elsewhere. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The answer might be that the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) contradicts Testimony 1 (saw Nickel Samurai). Because the button from the victim's costume was found in Engarde's costume, implying that the killer was in the victim's costume, not Engarde's. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony that she saw the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) is contradicted by the button evidence, suggesting the killer was wearing the Jammin' Ninja costume. But wait, the victim was the Jammin' Ninja, so if the killer was wearing that costume, it would be the victim's. But the victim was already dead. So maybe someone else was wearing the Jammin' Ninja costume. The button in Engarde's costume suggests he came into contact with the killer in the Jammin' Ninja costume, but Oldbag says she saw the Nickel Samurai. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (saw Nickel Samurai) and the button (Evidence 16) which is from the Jammin' Ninja costume, implying the killer was in that costume. \n\nBut how does that work? If the killer was in the Jammin' Ninja costume (victim's), then Oldbag would have seen that costume, not the Nickel Samurai. Therefore, the contradiction is that Oldbag claims to have seen the Nickel Samurai (Testimony 1), but the presence of the Jammin' Ninja's button in Engarde's costume suggests that the killer was in the Jammin' Ninja costume, not the Nickel Samurai. Therefore, the evidence (16) contradicts testimony (1). \n\nSo the answer would be {\"evidence\": 16, \"testimony\": 1}. But I need to check the evidence and testimony numbers. \n\nLooking at the evidence list: Evidence 16 is Jammin' Ninja's Button. Testimony 1 is \"The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\" So if the button is from the Jammin' Ninja's costume, and Oldbag claims to have seen the Nickel Samurai, that's a contradiction because the button suggests the killer was in the Jammin' Ninja's costume. Hence, presenting Evidence 16 against Testimony 1 shows a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be evidence 16 and testimony 1."

Can I look down now? My neck hurts... Tables at the back Phoenix: They haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over... Stage Phoenix: The awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous. Pearl: You just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright. Phoenix: (I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls. Front table Pearl: It's a feast fit for a king! Phoenix: Yeah. Pearl: It was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee? Phoenix: That's right, a \"kiwi\". Pearl: I don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one. Phoenix: (Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...) Hotel Lobby Examine Second floor Phoenix: A lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here... Camera Phoenix: These cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage. Seats Phoenix: Seats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now. Talk Wendy Oldbag Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...? Oldbag: Oh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip. Pearl: Um, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"... Oldbag: \"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Oldbag: And you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!? Phoenix: Um... I plead the fifth. Oldbag: But you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault! Phoenix: M-Me!? Oldbag: I thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky. Pearl: \"Body...guard?\" Oldbag: For your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles. Phoenix: (She's not talking about Edgeworth, is she...?) Oldbag: But... Edgeworth: That sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me. Oldbag: That's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!? Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* What happened? Phoenix: I'm sorry, but what in the world just happened? Oldbag: I don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again. Powers: A-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"? Oldbag: Maybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release) Phoenix: Um, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake? Oldbag: Silence, whippersnapper! Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* March 20Gatewater HotelHallway I. TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know! Nope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in! What's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back! Pearl: Those two sound pretty serious... Phoenix: (That southern accent can only mean...) Hey, Wright! Phoenix: H-Hey... Lotta... Lotta: Come on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights... Gumshoe: Ah, YOU! Phoenix: Ah... Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Hey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros... Pearl: A... A murder!? Gumshoe: Aw, shoot! Me and my big mouth! Lotta: See! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder! Gumshoe: H-Hey, wait... Yeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less! Gumshoe: Oh, man... I'm in trouble now... Talk What happened Phoenix: So... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...? Gumshoe: Ah, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal. Pearl: U-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...? Phoenix: Huh? Why do you ask? Pearl: Well, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so... Gumshoe: It wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off... Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: The guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal. Phoenix: The Jammin' Ninja... Lotta Hart Pearl: Um, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy... Phoenix: You mean Lotta? Pearl: That woman... She was there that time too, right? Phoenix: That time? Pearl: ...When Mystic Maya did that channeling... Phoenix: Oh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there. Pearl: Jer-nal-ist... Gumshoe: It looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened. Phoenix: \"Hanging around\"...? Gumshoe: Yeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal. Phoenix: B-But why would she...? Gumshoe: She wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"... Phoenix: (Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?) The victim (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: So the victim was the Jammin' Ninja? Pearl: Mr. Jammin' Ninja...? Gumshoe: He was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\". Pearl: Oh... Gumshoe: The victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is! Phoenix: (Yeah, even I recognize his face...) Gumshoe: But I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight. Phoenix: (I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...) Pearl: Mr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...? Gumshoe: Yup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Phoenix: ...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say? Gumshoe: I wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know? Phoenix: \"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...) Arrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile) Phoenix: Wh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks. Phoenix: (Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...) Pearl: Um... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this... Phoenix: Yeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know... Present Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: I was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power! Pearl: Awesome power...? Gumshoe: I thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal. Phoenix: ...That's a good way to improve yourself. Gumshoe: Ho ho ho. Well, it's nothing really... Lotta Hart profile Gumshoe: That girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list. Phoenix: Oh? Then who's number one...? Gumshoe: As if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal! Phoenix: A-Ah... So who's number two? Gumshoe: Maya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time. Pearl: It must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal! Phoenix: It's only wishful thinking. Gumshoe: Wishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight! Phoenix: (I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...) Gumshoe: Lately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal! Juan Corrida profile Gumshoe: I'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are. Phoenix: You can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess. Gumshoe: They even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal! Phoenix: (I never knew he thought of me as a rival...) Matt Engarde profile Gumshoe: The Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight! Phoenix: Maya's a big fan of his. Gumshoe: Really? ...Oh, I'm sorry then. Pearl: Why are you sorry? Gumshoe: Matt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida. Pearl: What!? Any evidence Phoenix: Would you take a look at this for me? Gumshoe: Listen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market! Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know this person? Gumshoe: You meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before. Pearl: Which means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective? Gumshoe: That's not what it means... Not exactly anyway... After clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway: March 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby Powers: Hey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: It looks like Juan Corrida has been killed. Powers: Wh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!? Phoenix: It looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde. Powers: Y-You're joking, right!? Phoenix: Nope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja. Powers: Ooogh... Not again... I feel sick. Pearl: \"Again\"...? Phoenix: ...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls. Powers: I still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would... Phoenix: (...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?) Powers: ...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier. Radio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers. Phoenix: ...For me...? But why? Powers: I don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney. Talk Matt and Juan Powers: Matt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway. Pearl: Mr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right? Powers: Those two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top. Phoenix: (I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...) Powers: Juan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show. Pearl: And that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...? Powers: The stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up. Phoenix: (Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...) Press conference Phoenix: Mr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he? Powers: That's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference. Phoenix: The Nickel Samurai's...? Powers: Yeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way. Phoenix: He was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release) Powers: I'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore. Present Radio Transceiver Powers: It was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up. Phoenix: And that's when he told you to give this to me...? Powers: Yeah... Phoenix: (Why... Why give me this transceiver...?) Maya Fey profile Powers: Hey, where did Maya go off to? Phoenix: She got a phone call. Powers: Oh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she? Will Powers profile Powers: Hey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am... Pearl: I think your face makes you look like a very kind person! Powers: ...! Phoenix: (Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.) Juan Corrida profile Powers: He debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know. Pearl: Really? Powers: Yeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry. Phoenix: (Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...) Matt Engarde profile Powers: Matt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential. Pearl: His star po-ten-shial...? Powers: I got his autograph the other day. Phoenix: ...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it? Powers: I don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't! Any other profile Powers: Umm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry... Phoenix: Ah, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much. Powers: S-Sorry. After clearing all Talk options: Pearl: Um... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time. Phoenix: (Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...) Pearl: Maybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her. ...*beep beep beep*... Phoenix: Ack! Pearl: Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick!? Phoenix: Huh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release) ...*beep*... Phoenix: Y-Yes, hello? Wright here... ???: Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? Phoenix: And you are...!? ???: You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as... Maya: Heeelp! Niiiiick! Pearl: M-Mystic Maya! Phoenix: Maya...? ???: So, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl? Phoenix: (Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!? ???: Come now. Don't fall apart on me yet. Phoenix: (Th-This... No! This can't be!) ???: Now that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms? Phoenix: ...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"... ???: Yes, that's it. This is a kidnapping. Pearl: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!! Phoenix: (M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!) ???: ...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release) Phoenix: H-How much!? How much do you want!? ???: Very good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation. Phoenix: Hurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya-- ???: Money is not what I seek. Phoenix: ...What? ???: What I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal. Phoenix: Complete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!? ???: I am not the person you will be representing. Phoenix: What...? ???: You are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there. Phoenix: Juan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde... ???: You are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde. Phoenix: M-Matt Engarde? But why? ???: He did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However... Phoenix: H-However!? However what!? ???: However, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall... Phoenix: ... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?) ???: You are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession. Maya: Mmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK! Phoenix: Maya! ???: You have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release) Phoenix: O-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!? ???: Yes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down. Phoenix: Aagh! ???: Oh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea. Phoenix: D-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!? ???: Alright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer. ...*beep*... Phoenix: ... Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!? Phoenix: ...She's been kidnapped. Pearl: N-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...! Phoenix: It's not your fault, Pearls. Pearl: But it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Powers: Mr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...! Phoenix: (No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...) Pearl: Mr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...? Phoenix: (...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back! Powers: Alright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away! Hallway Gumshoe: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!? Phoenix: Shhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde. Gumshoe: Wait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it! Phoenix: But the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent... Gumshoe: You really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!? Phoenix: (I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?) Gumshoe: And on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: The forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release) Phoenix: Umm... Gumshoe: But it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong. Phoenix: There's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?) Gumshoe: Anyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours. Phoenix: ...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?) Gumshoe: We've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way. Phoenix: You're right... Date:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Maya: Nnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...) ...*ka-click*... ???: I see you have awoken. Maya: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!? ???: Me? ...I am known as \"De Killer\". Maya: \"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!) ???: Don't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway. Maya: A-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me... ???: Yes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright. Maya: ...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...? ???: Calm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction. Maya: A... A business transaction? ???: I am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well. Maya: ...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis... ???: ... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as... March 21, 8:11 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Pearl: Good morning! Phoenix: Ah, morning, Pearls. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Mr. Nick! Come on! Let's hurry and go see Mr. Engarde! Phoenix: We have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so... Pearl: Oh, I see. Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release) Phoenix: (Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.) Pearl: Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!? Phoenix: Yeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that. Pearl: Please... Please... Help her... Phoenix: (I'm only able to stay this calm and collected... Because Pearls is doing the crying for the both of us...) Examine Anywhere Phoenix: ...No matter where I look in this familiar space I call my office... No, I can't let my mind wander now! I don't have the time! I've got to get going on this case! Talk What to do Pearl: Um... I have a thought... Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You're going to represent Mr. Engarde... aren't you? Phoenix: Yeah. I don't really seem to have a choice. Pearl: Um, but what if... What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: ... Pearl: Would you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...? Phoenix: Pearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing. Pearl: Y-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it... Maya's situation Phoenix: Pearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you? Pearl: I... I don't have anyone else left in this world. Phoenix: What do you mean...? Pearl: My family's all gone... Phoenix: (...Her family...) Pearl: My father... He left my mother and the village behind and went away. Phoenix: I'm sorry... Pearl: And... my mother... She did that thing... all for me... Phoenix: ... Pearl: Mystic Maya... She's like a sister to me... ... She is all I have left in this world... Present Anything Phoenix: Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (She looks out of it... Maybe I should leave her alone...) March 21, 8:57 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (We couldn't wait for visiting hours to start, so Pearls and I came down here early... To visit one Nickel Samurai, charged with the murder of the Jammin' Ninja...) Engarde: ... Phoenix: G-Good morning. How are you today? Engarde: ... Phoenix: I know this situation might be a little tough for you... Engarde: ... Phoenix: Um... We're... Engarde: Oh, sorry dude... Phoenix: ...? Engarde: I already signed up... Phoenix: E-Excuse me...? Engarde: I already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know... Phoenix: ... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople! Engarde: Really...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either. Phoenix: ...? Engarde: Fire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so... Phoenix: ... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright. Engarde: A lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ... Pearl: The Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he? Phoenix: (I think \"strange\" is an understatement.) Engarde: Sorry about that. You're just in time. Phoenix: Huh!? Engarde: You're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it? Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! This is our chance! Phoenix: (I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!) Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star? Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator. Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: Sorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions. Engarde: Um, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ... Pearl: Mr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to. Phoenix: (Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...) Engarde: Sorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude. Phoenix: (Does he have a mind of his own!?) What happened Phoenix: Mr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder... Engarde: Oh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff... Phoenix: No no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid... Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ... Pearl: Is he alright, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: (If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.) Engarde: Sorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\" Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...? Phoenix: It's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects. Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Mr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge. Engarde: Dude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that. Phoenix: ...Huh? Engarde: I'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now. Engarde: I don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course... Phoenix: (Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!) Press Conference Ticket Engarde: ...? What's that? Phoenix: It's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right? Engarde: Huh? Me? Phoenix: Yes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release) Engarde: Um, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager. Phoenix: (He didn't know...? That's odd...) Radio Transceiver Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that? Phoenix: I don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him... Engarde: Is that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too. Phoenix: I got it as a \"present\" from someone. Engarde: Hmm? Interesting. Phoenix: I've also been instructed to take your case. Engarde: Is that what you heard from the transceiver? Phoenix: Yes. Engarde: Dude, that's terrible! Don't let some disembodied voice boss you around! Phoenix: (This coming from a man with a cell phone on his wrist...) Will Powers profile Engarde: I've seen him somewhere before... Is he a member of my fan club? Phoenix: That's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you? Engarde: Powers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day. Phoenix: (He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...) Juan Corrida profile Engarde: Man, it's too bad he's dead... Phoenix: You killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree? Engarde: Dude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake. Phoenix: If that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ... Pearl: Stars sure know a lot of people, don't they? Phoenix: (I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...) Engarde: ...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all. Phoenix: (Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!) Matt Engarde profile Engarde: Yeah... I'm such a handsome devil. Phoenix: Uh... Um, yeah... Engarde: And I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing... Dude, it's no wonder I'm so popular. Phoenix: Uh... Um, yeah... (You're also good at sitting in a jail cell, Mr. Popular.) Any other evidence Engarde: Dude, I know I like to throw money around, but it's not like I buy anything and everything. Phoenix: (That's nice, because it's not up for sale anyway!) Any other profile Engarde: Um, dude, this person looks like a member of my fan club. Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the fan club president, OK? ... ... Phoenix: Um, \"dude\", you know what...? Forget I asked... After clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver: Engarde: ... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going. Phoenix: Please, wait! ...I really need to take your case! Engarde: There's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few? Pearl: Please! Please let Mr. Nick represent you! Engarde: Man, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too? Phoenix: If you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...! Engarde: ... Wait... What did you just say? Phoenix: \"De Killer\"... Engarde: D-De Killer!? Phoenix: (...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...) Engarde: ... Alright, dude. I accept your terms. Phoenix: Huh? Engarde: I'll let you represent me in court. Pearl: W-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Uh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...) Engarde: Go ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can... Talk Matt Engarde Engarde: Man, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name. Phoenix: Well, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight. Pearl: I didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...? Engarde: Ah, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular. Phoenix: (True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...) Engarde: Do you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am. Pearl: A spring breeze... Engarde: That's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad. Phoenix: (But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release) What happened Phoenix: Can you tell me about your activities last night? Engarde: After I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume. Phoenix: And you were alone the entire time? Engarde: My manager was running around being busy, so yeah. Phoenix: Because of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show? Engarde: I told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright? Phoenix: (That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...) Engarde: Anyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy... Phoenix: Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time...? Engarde: Yeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager. Phoenix: (I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release) Engarde: And that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me. The victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\") Phoenix: About you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of... Engarde: That's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail. Phoenix: The Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right? Engarde: Yeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know? The charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... Do you know why you were arrested? Engarde: I guess maybe my full body search went badly. Phoenix: Did they find something on you? Engarde: They found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume. Phoenix: A button...? Engarde: I don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\". Pearl: Aaah! Engarde: Dude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious. Phoenix: (I wonder if that's what really happened...?) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...) Pearl: Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah? Pearl: Let's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not... Phoenix: W-We can do that...? Pearl: Yes. If you use this... Phoenix: (Maya's Magatama!) Pearl: He won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it. Phoenix: (I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly. Engarde: What is it, dude? Phoenix: Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida? Engarde: ... Phoenix: Please put the phone away and answer this question yourself. Engarde: Alright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK? Phoenix: ... Pearl: Well, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Nothing. Not a chain or lock in sight. Pearl: Which means... I think it is alright to trust him. Phoenix: (Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.) Engarde: Um... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude. To be continued. March 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Well, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important... Pearl: So! So now what should we do!? Phoenix: Well, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer. Pearl: OK! Then let's start looking! Examine Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...? Charley the plant Pearl: Oh! I'll water it! Phoenix: Ah, it's OK... I already did that... Pearl: ...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...? Phoenix: (Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...) Poster Pearl: This is the Nickel Samurai... right? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, that's right. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!? Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. Pearl: Oh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either... Phoenix: I-It's OK, Pearls. Really. Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep... Talk What to do Phoenix: Since there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent. Pearl: I really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\" Any ideas Phoenix: Hey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls. Pearl: OK, what is it? Phoenix: Why are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go-- Pearl: Huh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...! Phoenix: (Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...) Pearl: Mr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me! Phoenix: (Ow! She slapped me!!) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: That's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it? Phoenix: I guess? Pearl: I feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama... Phoenix: (Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...) Maya Fey profile Pearl: Oh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright... Phoenix: I'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me. Pearl: If there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!? Pearl Fey profile Pearl: To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me. Phoenix: I think your hair now suits you perfectly. Pearl: R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget* Phoenix: *fidget, fidget* Dick Gumshoe profile Pearl: I'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked! Phoenix: Yeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.) Will Powers profile Pearl: He's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he? Phoenix: (Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...? Pearl: What about you, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...) Anything else Pearl: Um, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training. Phoenix: Ah, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself... Pearl: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry! March 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Engarde: Ah, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out? Phoenix: Um, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating... Engarde: I see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude. Present Press Conference Ticket Engarde: Dude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager. Phoenix: (...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...) Radio Transceiver Engarde: So, why are you carrying around that transceiver...? Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about it. Engarde: And why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude. Phoenix: (On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret. Engarde: OK, whatever, dude. Juan Corrida profile Engarde: Look, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him. Pearl: Being rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person... March 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby Oldbag: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without... Pearl: Good morning. Oldbag: Hold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!? Phoenix: U-Uh... Um... Oldbag: I heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds. Phoenix: Um, you know... That's not entirely... Oldbag: I'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt. Phoenix: Um... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened... Oldbag: Hmph! Don't push me, boy! Pearl: Um... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast... Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...? Oldbag: Don't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants! Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Examine Stage Phoenix: It's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but... Pearl: ...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh? Phoenix: (How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?) Talk The victim Oldbag: My dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again. Phoenix: ...I don't know what to say... Oldbag: I ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket? Phoenix: Umm... Oldbag: I'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan! Phoenix: But I haven't said anything... Oldbag: Well, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway! Phoenix: Huh? What woman? Oldbag: That irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or Phoenix: ...Pearls? Are you thirsty? Pearl: Um, a little. Phoenix: OK. I'll go get you some juice or something. Pearl: Th-Thank you very much. Oldbag: Hey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today! Phoenix: (So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...) What happened Phoenix: I want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder... Oldbag: Ah, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready. Phoenix: Getting ready? For what...? Oldbag: The show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards. Phoenix: (Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.) Oldbag: Anyway, I don't know anything about the murder. Phoenix: Ah, I see... Oldbag: ... But. Phoenix: ? Oldbag: But if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly! Pearl: What!? Oldbag: I saw the most important moment of the night! What you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Th-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!? Oldbag: Oh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today. Phoenix: Please tell me! What did you see!? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Oldbag: The murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't? Phoenix: (Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...) Oldbag: If you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present! What you witnessed (subsequent times) Phoenix: Please tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!? Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: P-Please! Mystic Maya's life is... Oldbag: Ah, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph! Phoenix: (What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!) Present Anything Oldbag: I don't have anything to say to delinquents like you! Phoenix: (Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...) Pearl: Please! Anything would be helpful! Oldbag: Well then, how about I tell you my measurements? Phoenix: ...Um... No, that's okay... Really. Pearl: She really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I know, I know... March 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall Phoenix: Looks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens. Pearl: I wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere... Phoenix: ...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess. Examine Doors on left Phoenix: There's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together... Chandelier Pearl: That is such a beautiful sight. Phoenix: The chandelier? Pearl: Yes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking. Stage Phoenix: The awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous. Pearl: You just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright. Phoenix: (I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls. Front table Pearl: We ate at this table last night, didn't we? Phoenix: Yes. Pearl: I was really happy then. Phoenix: (I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...) March 21Gatewater HotelHallway Lotta: Hey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer! Phoenix: Lotta... Lotta: Hey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face! Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What!? Lotta: Arrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty! Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright? Lotta: Looked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release) Pearl: Um, what are you looking for...? Lotta: My CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!! Phoenix: Y-Your camera...? Lotta: Look, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are! Phoenix: Yep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble. Pearl: Huh!? Examine Teddy bear Phoenix: I can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Lotta: I didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word! Phoenix: (Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?) Flowers on left Phoenix: Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think... Lotta: Yeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course. Phoenix: (I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...) Door on left Phoenix: There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". Lotta: So that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder. Door on right Phoenix: There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". Pearl: So Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right? Phoenix: That's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.) Talk Camera Phoenix: So you lost your camera...? Lotta: It ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new! Pearl: Huh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700? Lotta: I had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that! Pearl: When did you lose your camera? Lotta: Last night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie! Phoenix: Lotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours? Lotta: I don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop. Phoenix: (I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?) Lotta's Camera added to the Court Record. Camera (subsequent times) Phoenix: So you lost your camera...? Lotta: It ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new! Pearl: Huh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700? Lotta: I had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that! Pearl: When did you lose your camera? Lotta: Last night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie! Phoenix: Lotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours? Lotta: I don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop. Phoenix: (I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?) What happened Phoenix: Lotta, please tell me what you know about what happened at the time of the murder. Lotta: Well, from before the ceremony last night, I was hangin' around here in this area. Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested. Phoenix: What were you doing here...? Lotta: You sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had! Phoenix: A big scoop...? Lotta: I told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot! Phoenix: (I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?) Lotta: Although, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time... Big scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\") Phoenix: Lotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop? Lotta: Well... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof? Phoenix: What kind of story was it that you would hang around here...? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Lotta: Oops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know? Phoenix: (Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?) Pearl: We've been stopped, haven't we? Lotta: Ha ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer! Phoenix: (I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...) Big scoop (subsequent times) Phoenix: You were on the hunt for your big scoop last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Lotta: It's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder. Pearl: It looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks. Phoenix: Yeah... I guess so. Present Press Conference Ticket Lotta: Hey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!? Phoenix: P-Please don't direct your anger at me... Lotta: Why in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!? Phoenix: (...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?) Pearl: Are you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!? Lotta's Camera Lotta: Nngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal! Phoenix: Please don't look straight at me while you're saying that... Lotta: When I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet! Phoenix: (And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...) Maya Fey profile Lotta: Now that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...? Pearl: Um... Lotta: She's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now... Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk...) Pearl: ... Pearl Fey profile Lotta: Ah, just wanna say sorry to ya. Pearl: For...? Lotta: Well, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer. Pearl: ...Huh? Lotta: You know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey... Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What!? But why!? Lotta: I mean, you were all worked up, ya know? Pearl: *sniffle* ...Meanie... Phoenix: Lotta, that was very insensitive of you! Lotta Hart profile Lotta: This kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot! Pearl: Wow, that's really lucky! Phoenix: (*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...) Juan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile Lotta: I don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot. Pearl: Oh, I see... Lotta: And shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me... Pearl: O-Oh... Lotta: Sounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this! Phoenix: W-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that! Security Lady profile Lotta: This old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know... Phoenix: (A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.) Anything else Phoenix: Um... Do you know anything... Lotta: ...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there! Pearl: Please don't get so worked up over this... Lotta: Hah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters. March 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room Pearl: Um... Where are we? Phoenix: We're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room. ???: May I help you with something? Phoenix: Um, uh... We're... ???: You're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail. Phoenix: Um... How did you know I'm his lawyer...? ???: You were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer. Pearl: Wow... ???: It's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct? Phoenix: Well, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either. Pearl: It's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick. Andrews: I am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business. Phoenix: A-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...) Examine Red suitcase Phoenix: It's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here. Pearl: Stars really are different from us, aren't they...? Bedroom Phoenix: That's the bedroom over there. Pearl: That's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here! Sofa Phoenix: There's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here. Pearl: Um, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\". Phoenix: (Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...) Table Phoenix: Looks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that. Pearl: I'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates. Phoenix: Looks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...? Plate on right Phoenix: There's a giant bone sitting on the plate. Pearl: I... I don't really like meat... Phoenix: (...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...) Talk Night of the murder Andrews: I assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct? Phoenix: Y-Yes, that is correct. Andrews: Then I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add. Phoenix: \"Dinner\"? What did you eat? Andrews: I told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me. Phoenix: (...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...) Andrews: When the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall. Phoenix: And after the show ended, you came back to this room...? Andrews: No, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby. Phoenix: Oh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...) Andrews: When it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida... Phoenix: And that's when you found his body, isn't it? Andrews: ... Pearl: You really held strong through everything... Phoenix: (Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...) Relation to Engarde Phoenix: Um, so... About you and... Andrews: Stop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release) Phoenix: S-Sorry... Andrews: I have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Why did she have to go and say something like that...?) Pearl: Mr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright? Andrews: I already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager. Phoenix: His manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one? Andrews: No, he did not. Phoenix: He didn't? Andrews: Global Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars. Phoenix: I see... Andrews: This industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly. Pearl: You're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...! Phoenix: Pearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright? Pearl: Nngh... Motive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile) Phoenix: Do you have any ideas? Andrews: As to...? Phoenix: As to why Mr. Corrida was murdered? Andrews: Why would you ask me about such a thing...? Phoenix: I'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: M-Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: Sorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation. Pearl: Is it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately. Motive for murder (subsequent times) Phoenix: You know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered... 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Andrews: Why are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart. Phoenix: (No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.) Pearl: If you don't remove her locks... Phoenix: (Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...) Present Press Conference Ticket Phoenix: You were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right? Andrews: Yes, that's right. Pearl: But Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it. Andrews: ... Is that what he said...? Pearl: Huh...? Andrews: Actually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked. Pearl: Oh... I see. Phoenix: (I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.) Will Powers profile Andrews: That's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be. Phoenix: (Urk... What a horrible thing to say...) Andrews: ...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...) Pearl: I wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews... Juan Corrida profile Phoenix: Did you know the victim, Mr. Corrida? Andrews: Yes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all. Pearl: Did you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai? Andrews: Honestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release) Phoenix: ! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!) Matt Engarde profile Andrews: I asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition. Phoenix: (Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...) Pearl: He's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick? Andrews: ... Adrian Andrews profile Andrews: I hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why. Phoenix: S-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...) Anything else Phoenix: Um, I'd like to ask you about this... Andrews: I told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me. Phoenix: (Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...) March 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room Pearl: Mr. Nick... Where are we...? Phoenix: We're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls. Pearl: Mr. Corrida...? Phoenix: The victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too. Gumshoe: Oh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!? Phoenix: Not yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal. Gumshoe: Umm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there? Phoenix: (I just want Maya to be alright...) Pearl: ... Gumshoe: We don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal. Phoenix: Can you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...? Gumshoe: Just this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here. Phoenix: Thank you. Gumshoe: Oh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy. Pearl: Wow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you! Gumshoe: Ha ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good. Pearl: Mr. Nick! I got a map! Phoenix: That's great, Pearls! Pearl: ... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says... Hotel Guidemap added to the Court Record. Examine Refrigerator Phoenix: There are all sorts of things in this refrigerator... Pearl: The carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty... Phoenix: Empty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut. Pearl: ...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too! Phoenix: Maybe red was his favorite color...? Stuffed bears Pearl: Wow, there are a lot of bears! Phoenix: (Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?) Pearl: There's even a few in the trash can... Phoenix: Yeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears. Pearl: Poor teddies... It's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Phoenix: ... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...) Pearl: What's wrong, Mr. Nick? Desk Pearl: Hmph! It's so messy here! Phoenix: (Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...) Pearl: There are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please? Phoenix: OK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist. Pearl: ... I know what a watch is... Phoenix: (Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...) Blue suitcase Phoenix: It's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator... Pearl: Do all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida? Table on right Phoenix: It looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night. Pearl: This bottle... It's tomato juice. Phoenix: (We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...) Bedroom Pearl: So that's a bed, right? Phoenix: Yup. It's big, but it's a bed. Pearl: Aaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft! Phoenix: (Big beds must be a rarity for her...) Scattered items near guitar case Phoenix: Bottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant. Pearl: What's this glass fragment from...? Phoenix: A flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are. Pearl: You don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick? Guitar case Phoenix: This is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable. Pearl: That's strange. The guitar is not here... Phoenix: Maybe he forgot to bring it to the show? Pearl: But Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item... Phoenix: (That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid... Pearl: Yeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...? Guitar Case added to the Court Record. Guitar case (subsequent times) Phoenix: This is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable. Pearl: That's strange. The guitar is not here... Phoenix: Maybe he forgot to bring it to the show? Pearl: But Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item... Phoenix: (That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid... Pearl: Yeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...? Wine glass Phoenix: It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it. Pearl: Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much. Phoenix: There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from. Pearl: But doesn't it seem weird? Phoenix: ...What seems weird? Pearl: I mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor. Phoenix: ... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.) Pearl: Why is this glass the only thing that's still alright...? Wine Glass added to the Court Record. Wine glass (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it. Pearl: Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.

Pearl: Why is this glass the only thing that's still alright...? Talk Cause of death Phoenix: Do you know what was the cause of death? Gumshoe: Well, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release) Phoenix: It should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah. Here's a picture. Phoenix: There's a knife in his chest. Gumshoe: Yeah, pal, that's the murder weapon. Phoenix: (So he was stabbed to death...) Gumshoe: They're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now. Phoenix: There were fingerprints on the knife? Gumshoe: Yup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal. Phoenix: (That's bad... Real bad...) Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Cause of death (subsequent times) Phoenix: Do you know what was the cause of death? Gumshoe: Well, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release) Phoenix: It should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah. Here's a picture. Phoenix: There's a knife in his chest. Gumshoe: Yeah, pal, that's the murder weapon. Phoenix: (So he was stabbed to death...) Gumshoe: They're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now. Phoenix: There were fingerprints on the knife? Gumshoe: Yup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal. Phoenix: (That's bad... Real bad...) Reason for arrest Phoenix: Why was Mr. Engarde arrested? Gumshoe: Because we had evidence on him. Pearl: Evidence...? Gumshoe: It looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight. Phoenix: Yeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere. Gumshoe: Well, yeah. During the fight, his button came off... Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...) Gumshoe: But that's not all... Phoenix: What!? Gumshoe: There was a witness, pal. Phoenix: A witness!? Wh-Who is it!? Gumshoe: That lady... Ms. Oldbag. Phoenix: (Please... Anyone but her!) Gumshoe: The prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release) Phoenix: Something that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: As in, that's for you to figure out, pal! Pearl: Alright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick! Present Radio Transceiver Gumshoe: That's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that... Pearl: Yeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is! Phoenix: (It uses radio waves, huh?) Gumshoe: I got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal! Guitar Case Phoenix: What can you tell me about this guitar case? Gumshoe: Oh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item. Phoenix: The guitar case? Gumshoe: No, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course! Pearl: But... The guitar is missing. Gumshoe: Yeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show. Phoenix: (It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...) Wine Glass Phoenix: So about this wine glass... Gumshoe: Ah, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched. Phoenix: You noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...? Gumshoe: No, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first. Phoenix: Yeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release) Phoenix: You can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash. Crime Photo Gumshoe: You look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\" Phoenix: (Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: I'm sorry. Phoenix: ...For what? Gumshoe: I really want to help you look for her, pal. Pearl: Mr. Detective... Gumshoe: If anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can! Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey, little missy. Listen good, OK? Pearl: OK. What is it? Gumshoe: Don't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it. Pearl: Huh!? Gumshoe: If you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK? Phoenix: (Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...) Lotta Hart profile Gumshoe: If I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see. Phoenix: ...Because I'm in the number one spot? Gumshoe: Don't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Really? Then who's in first...? Gumshoe: Ms. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race. Phoenix: O-Oh... Gumshoe: She's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't... Phoenix: (He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...) Matt Engarde profile Gumshoe: Hey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so. Phoenix: One dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money? Gumshoe: I... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's... Phoenix: (It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!) Pearl: Mr. Nick... Security Lady profile Gumshoe: I thought she was an alien from outer space. Phoenix: Yeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet. Gumshoe: Nah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal. Phoenix: ... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean... Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: She's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\". Phoenix: Yeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together. Gumshoe: Compared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up. Phoenix: (I feel sort of bad for him...) Anything else Phoenix: What do you know about this? Gumshoe: Um... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast... After clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass: ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... Pearl: Wh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: (Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...) Gumshoe: It's Ms. von Karma... Pearl: Huh? Gumshoe: For some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release) Gumshoe: S-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww! von Karma: At last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?) von Karma: So you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you! Phoenix: (Owww!) von Karma: Hey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat! Gumshoe: Ah! von Karma: I didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful... Gumshoe: Uwaah! von Karma: Detective! Come over here for a second! Gumshoe: Yeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow! von Karma: ...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment. Phoenix: (He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...) von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine! Phoenix: ... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...? von Karma: Wh-What...!? Phoenix: ... von Karma: ... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! von Karma: This isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor! Phoenix: (Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?) Gumshoe: ...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you... Examine Paper on desk Pearl: Mr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...? Phoenix: It's called an \"autograph\". Pearl: Auto-graff? Phoenix: It's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph. Pearl: I can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this. Phoenix: Ah, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here? Pearl: Th-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone! Phoenix: (Hold on...) Pearl: ...? Phoenix: Wendy... I've heard that name somewhere before... Mr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record. After visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room: March 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall Powers: Oh, Mr. Wright! How are you? Phoenix: Ah, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time? Powers: Yeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave... Talk The Nickel Samurai Phoenix: Can you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show? Powers: OK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\". Phoenix: I see... Powers: This time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo! Phoenix: I see... ... W-Wait... A love what...? Powers: A love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time. Phoenix: Oh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl? Powers: Anyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader! Phoenix: Sounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three. Powers: Y-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies. Pearl: Um... Powers: Yes, Pearl? Pearl: Wh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she? Powers: Every Sunday at 8 AM. Pearl: I'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week! Phoenix: (I can't believe she's really considering it!) Jammin' Ninja Phoenix: So what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like? Powers: It started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star. Phoenix: ...Uh, what? Powers: He was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm. Phoenix: A... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!? Powers: And then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3! Phoenix: Aww, that's too bad for him... Powers: Y-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like. Pearl: Um... Powers: Yes, Pearl? Pearl: Wh-What happens next!? I want to know! Pearl: Jammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!? Powers: Every Sunday at 8 AM. Pearl: Umm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm... Phoenix: (I can't believe she's really  considering it!) The gossip on Adrian (appears after presenting Adrian Andrews profile) Phoenix: Would you mind telling me about this \"gossip\"? Powers: Ah, so you ARE interested in it! I figured you would be! (Changed from [Ah, so you're interested in it too! I figured you would be!] in the original release) Phoenix: Yeah. Powers: I have such a weakness for celebrity gossip, too. Phoenix: O-Oh really... You too, huh...? Powers: Yeah. So take a look at this! Phoenix: (Looks like a tabloid Ms. Oldbag would read...) Alright, let's see here... \"Jammin' Midnight Rendezvous!?\" Powers: \"...to the mysterious, yet beautiful manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\" ...Y-You see now, don't you? Phoenix: What...? Powers: You can stop pretending to be in the dark, Mr. Wright! Juan Corrida didn't have a manager of his own. Which means if we're talking about a certain manager with the initials A. A.... Phoenix: ... Adrian Andrews...? Powers: Y-Yes, exactly! This is big news!! Phoenix: (But... It seems kind of odd. That woman, Ms. Andrews... Together with the biggest rival of her client...?)

And I didn't suspect a thing because he looked like such a normal old man... Phoenix: (Old man, huh...) Guitar Case Powers: That guitar case... That was Juan's... Phoenix: I'm guessing you've seen this case before? Powers: It's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar. Phoenix: (The bright red guitar... The Jammin' Ninja's signature item.) Pearl: But if the guitar is so important, how could he forget it for the award ceremony? Phoenix: (That does seem a little strange...) Maya Fey profile Powers: I... I'm sure he won't hurt her and he'll let her go soon... Phoenix: Yeah... Powers: Mr. Wright. I believe in you. You will save her! Phoenix: Thanks. Security Lady profile Powers: I never would've thought I'd see her here of all places. The last time we saw each other was during that really bad incident... You know... I mean, when I look back now, I think of the good things, so it's not so bad, I guess. Phoenix: Yeah, I would love to go back in time and relive a few of those good things... *chuckle* Powers: Th-That's not funny... Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess not...) Adrian Andrews profile Powers: Hey, that's Ms. Andrews! She's Matt's manager. Actually, I was interested in her for a little bit. Just a little... Phoenix: (Hmm... So Mr. Powers likes this type of woman...) What do you know about Ms. Andrews...? Powers: Well, see... Here's the thing. I don't really KNOW her know her... you know? Pearl: ...! Powers: There's sort of a small rumor going around about her right now... Pearl: A rumor...? Powers: Ah! If you're interested, I can give you a little bit of the details! Phoenix: (He's so happy, he looks like a lion that's just found his next meal...) Detention Center Present Magazine Clipping Phoenix: What do you think about this article...? Engarde: ... Hmph. If you're talking about her thing with Juan, I always thought she was a bit careless in the way she handled it... ... Phoenix: And that's it? Engarde: ...That's it. Adrian Andrews profile Engarde: That's my manager. Did you meet her? Phoenix: Uh, yeah. Engarde: What do you think? Strong woman, right? And she takes good care of me...

Oldbag: I tell you, I saw him that night. I saw him coming out of Juan's room. Phoenix: You're kidding! Pearl: Oh no! Oldbag: It was about ten minutes before Juan's body was discovered. It was just a coincidence. I was on my way to the toilet, minding my own business. Phoenix: And...? Did you tell that to the police? Oldbag: Well, of course! I thought I could get a gift certificate or two out of it, maybe more. Pearl: Gift certificate...? Oldbag: I've been recruited again for that part at the trial. You know, the trial tomorrow?

That guy, he shoved the girl onto Juan on purpose! Phoenix: His own manager? But why...? Oldbag: I thought lawyers were smart! It was to create a scandal to make Juan lose face! That girl drove Juan into a scandal that dragged his reputation through the mud! Phoenix: (Sounds like a pretty standard definition of a scandal to me...) Why do you know about that anyway, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: I'm one of Juan's biggest fans! I'm always out there gathering information! There's nothing I don't know! Phoenix: And do you have proof that Mr. Engarde did what you say he did...? Oldbag: Next week's issue of a certain magazine says so! Phoenix: (Ugh... Of course. A tabloid...) Pearl: Next week...

But I will say one thing... Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: You can't win on your own at the trial tomorrow. Phoenix: (What is that supposed to mean...?) Edgeworth: I have something definitive that you lack. And working together is the definition of teamwork. It's the power to find the truth. (Changed from [And that's the definition of teamwork.

I'm not in charge of this case, so I can be a bit more generous with information. Phoenix: (Just what is going on inside his head...?) \"Proof of Von Karma blood\" Edgeworth: A lot of things may have happened, however Manfred von Karma was still my mentor. And a \"perfect win record\" is proof of a Von Karma. Phoenix: ...One year ago, you could not establish guilt in a few cases... Are those losses the reason you suddenly disappeared from the Prosecutor's Office? Did you leave because you had lost your \"perfect win record\"...? Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: To think your motivation for prosecuting trials was so selfish... It'd been better for everyone if you never came back from the dead, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ... I see.

I stand in the courtroom to defend my client. ...To save their lives. Edgeworth: To save your client, you say? Phoenix: Those who think only of their own ego-driven goals... Those kind of prosecutors are reprehensible to me. Even if you're a \"prodigy\"... Or someone like you, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ... It looks like there is still a lot you have yet to learn. Phoenix: \"A lot I have yet to learn\"? Me...? Edgeworth: ...Hmph. Well, that's enough for now. The time when you will see is coming soon enough... Missing suicide note (appears after presenting Celeste Inpax profile) Edgeworth: Ms. Inpax's death was most certainly a suicide. Of that there is no mistake. However, we could not find her suicide note. That's when the police began to suspect that someone had hidden it. Phoenix: The suicide note? But how do you know Ms. Inpax had even written such a note? Edgeworth: There was no solid evidence, however... We did find traces of ink on her right index finger. Which makes the likelihood of a suicide note very high. Phoenix: But who would hide such a thing...? Edgeworth: The police think it was Mr. Juan Corrida himself. Phoenix: Th-The victim...? Edgeworth: He was the one who found her body. Which makes him the only person who had a chance to hide her suicide note. Phoenix: (Mr. Corrida hid his own manager's suicide note...? But why...?)

Because she had apparently \"lost her will to live.\" (Changed from [Quite possibly because she had 'lost her will to live.'] in the original release) Phoenix: Lost her will...? But why would she...? Edgeworth: Her pillar of strength, her mentor Celeste Inpax, was gone forever. That's why. Phoenix: Wh-Why would that...? Pearl: Is this what they call, \"following someone to the grave\"...?

Worst of all are the reports that have multiple parts like that one. That has two. Phoenix: ...Two parts? Edgeworth: What you just handed me is the first part of the report... Here is the second part. Phoenix: (The second part of the report is about an attempted suicide...) The attempter's name...! It's \"Adrian Andrews\"! Pearl: M-Ms. Andrews...? Um, what did she do?

Andrews: ... Why do you ask questions for which I have no answers? The truth is, I was not that close to Mr. Corrida. Phoenix: You were not that close...? Andrews: That's right.

Ironic, isn't it? Phoenix: Well, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire. Andrews: And if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning. Pearl: ...

Phoenix: And that's when the victim's body was found, correct? Edgeworth: Which is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period. Judge: Hmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe: The victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct? Gumshoe: ...Yeah. Judge: Who is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about? Gumshoe: She's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir. Judge: Ah, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence... Gumshoe: When the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir. Judge: I see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe: After looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...? Gumshoe: Only a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana. Judge: Mmm... \"Banana\"... Gumshoe: Um, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir. Judge: Ah, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana. Phoenix: Then, what about the knife...? Gumshoe: It seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death. Judge: Hmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: The cause of death...

We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe: At first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you think that? Gumshoe: Because it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime. Judge: Oh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!? Gumshoe: Um, we thought of that too... But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: The only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's. Phoenix: Only the victim's, huh...? Judge: Hmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then... Guitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you think that? Gumshoe: Because it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime. Judge: Oh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!? Gumshoe: Um, we thought of that too... But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: The only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's. Phoenix: Only the victim's, huh...? Judge: Hmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe: However, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What convinced you it had nothing to do with the case? Gumshoe: The guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night. Judge: Well then, where was it? Gumshoe: The bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir. Judge: So you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...? Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar. Phoenix: So that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel... Gumshoe: Yeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all. Judge: Hmm...Mia: Our first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix: But there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia: Maybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix: If you say so...Mia: Of course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:Edgeworth: I believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge: Hmm...Edgeworth: Which brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix: (Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge: Very well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe: Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other. They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book. As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button. It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\". The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife. The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge: Hmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe: It was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe: ...And there's this button.Judge: That was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe: Yes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix: What!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge: All of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth: Yes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix: Hmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth: You can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix: Grrrrrrrrr...Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not? Gumshoe: ...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown. Phoenix: But Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end... Judge: That is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing. Edgeworth: ...Gumshoe: They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls! Gumshoe: Well, yeah, I guess, but... Phoenix: Which means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all! Judge: Hmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective? Gumshoe: Um, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired. Gumshoe: Eh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's... Edgeworth: I look forward to your pension negotiations. Gumshoe: N-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO! Judge: Now, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony. Gumshoe: *sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too... Edgeworth: Detective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir! Phoenix: (Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe: As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have any proof that button belonged to the victim? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: Oh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\". Gumshoe: Huh? But can't you tell by just looking at it? Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: A-And the victim's blood is on it. Phoenix: Anyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward. Gumshoe: ... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir! Phoenix: (Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...) Edgeworth: ...Thread. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: The button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal! Phoenix: Urk. Mia: That's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe: It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press Phoenix: Phoenix: When was this button found? Gumshoe: Pretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button. Judge: Hmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder... Edgeworth: The police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people... Phoenix: (Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe: The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How were the fingerprints arranged on the knife? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: By examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...? Gumshoe: Oh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that... Phoenix: (I can't believe the bumbling of this department...) Edgeworth: ...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder. Judge: Hmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe: The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife! Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either. Phoenix: (Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...) Mia: ...Phoenix. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: There's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wait a second!\"Phoenix: (A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia: Be grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix: We're still in a world of trouble...Mia: Well, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not? Gumshoe: ...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown. Phoenix: But Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end... Judge: That is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing. Edgeworth: ...Gumshoe: They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls! Gumshoe: Well, yeah, I guess, but... Phoenix: Which means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all! Judge: Hmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective? Gumshoe: Um, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired. Gumshoe: Eh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's... Edgeworth: I look forward to your pension negotiations. Gumshoe: N-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO! Judge: Now, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony. Gumshoe: *sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too... Edgeworth: Detective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir! Phoenix: (Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe: As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have any proof that button belonged to the victim? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: Oh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\". Gumshoe: Huh? But can't you tell by just looking at it? Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: A-And the victim's blood is on it. Phoenix: Anyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward. Gumshoe: ... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir! Phoenix: (Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...) Edgeworth: ...Thread. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: The button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal! Phoenix: Urk. Mia: That's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe: It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press Phoenix: Phoenix: When was this button found? Gumshoe: Pretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button. Judge: Hmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder... Edgeworth: The police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people... Phoenix: (Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe: The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How were the fingerprints arranged on the knife? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: By examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...? Gumshoe: Oh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that... Phoenix: (I can't believe the bumbling of this department...) Edgeworth: ...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder. Judge: Hmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe: The defendant bought the knife for the crime...

It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either. Phoenix: (Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...) Mia: ...Phoenix. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: There's something very interesting about what the detective said just now.

If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix: We're still in a world of trouble...Mia: Well, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix: Wait a second!Gumshoe: Wh-What?Phoenix: So the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe: That's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix: ...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe: H-Huh!?Phoenix: Take a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe: ...Huh?Judge: It has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe: \"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix: That's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe: ... Uh oh.Phoenix: The murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge: Yes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth: Heh heh heh...Judge: Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix: What!?Edgeworth: I think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix: H-How so!?Edgeworth: I admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe: ...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth: The question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge: Wh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth: Sorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge: There is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth: If it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix: Urk...Edgeworth: Mr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge: Amazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia: It seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix: (This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge: A murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth: I can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix: (Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia: He means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge: What does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Um, well...Mia: Phoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix: (That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge: Mr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do. Leads to: \"There's one...\"No, not right now. Phoenix: (This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.) Judge: Looks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one. Edgeworth: Which means this court is adjourned. Mia: Phoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick! Phoenix: (Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!) Phoenix: Leads to: \"There's one...\"Phoenix: There's one...Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: One piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge: Mr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth: What the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix: (If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge: You may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass Phoenix: Leads to: \"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong. Judge: I can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence. Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: I am a man of my word, Mr. Wright! Infinite penaltyJudge: This... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix: Please look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge: Hmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix: However! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge: ...Gumshoe: ...Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: W-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge: Ah, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix: Y-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge: You can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: What is it, Your Honor?Judge: Your opinion...Edgeworth: ...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix: ...What!?Edgeworth: It's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge: Hmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible. Phoenix: (It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...) Mia: You can't think like that, Phoenix. Phoenix: Mia... Mia: Right now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing! Phoenix: (So in other words, push as far as we can go...) Leads to: \"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way. Phoenix: (If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!) Mia: They just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough! Leads to: \"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix: The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge: Hmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix: (There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth: Unlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix: Wh-What!?Edgeworth: You're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix: Th-Then...Edgeworth: Of course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix: Fingerprints...Edgeworth: There were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge: Only one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth: They were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix: WHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth: That is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth: Ms. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge: Hmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth: Tsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix: Grrr!Edgeworth: I've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge: W-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix: \"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth: Yes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia: What in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth: Now then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag: ...Edgeworth: ... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth: Uurrngh!Oldbag: ...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth: Grrrrrrrrr...Phoenix: (I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag: Oh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth: I saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag: I tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge: Ms... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge: Oof!Oldbag: Shush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge: Yes, madam.Edgeworth: No no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag: It's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth: The witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag: It was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge: You mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag: Look, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix: (Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag: Anyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth: Very well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag: Leave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag: Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room. There was something I was interested in finding out, you know... Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time. That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room. It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge: Hmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag: See! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth: ...Judge: I see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag: Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag, what was your post on that night? Oldbag: The lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails. Phoenix: (Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...) Oldbag: Besides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little. Phoenix: And that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag: There was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Something you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that? Oldbag: It's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...? Edgeworth: I have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor. Phoenix: (\"Gossip\"...?) Edgeworth: If this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony. Mia: It looks like we shouldn't force it right now. Judge: Hmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag: Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Oh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room? Oldbag: I have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am! Judge: ...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report. Edgeworth: In any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag: That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who in the world was that!? Oldbag: I'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was... Judge: Yes...? He was...? Oldbag: ... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud! Phoenix: (Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...) Oldbag: Well, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag: It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!? Oldbag: Yessey! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Annoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person! Phoenix: (Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release)) The person's face Phoenix: Please tell the court about the man's face in more detail! Oldbag: You don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth! Phoenix: His teeth were... shining? Oldbag: Well, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie. Phoenix: ... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night! Oldbag: What? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!? Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all. Judge: *sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn. Oldbag: You've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me! Phoenix: (And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...) Leads back to cross-examination It was very important. Phoenix: Of course it was important, Your Honor! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important! Phoenix: You don't really have to put it that way to get me to say... Judge: Mr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...) Leads back to cross-examination What the person was carrying Phoenix: What was the man you saw carrying? Oldbag: In which hand? His right or his left? Phoenix: Um... Oldbag: Ah, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question! Judge: Indeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: S-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand? Oldbag: Ah, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand. Phoenix: Then how about his left? Oldbag: Empty. Phoenix: ... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...) Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important.

Oldbag: What a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters. Phoenix: But it does. Oldbag: Um... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing. Phoenix: What thing? Oldbag: That gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket. Phoenix: (Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...) Oldbag: That thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!! Phoenix: Um, right... Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all.

I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night! Oldbag: What? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!? Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all. Judge: *sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn. Oldbag: You've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me! Phoenix: (And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...) Leads back to cross-examination It was very important. Phoenix: Of course it was important, Your Honor! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important! Phoenix: You don't really have to put it that way to get me to say... Judge: Mr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...) Leads back to cross-examination What the person was carrying Phoenix: What was the man you saw carrying? Oldbag: In which hand? His right or his left? Phoenix: Um... Oldbag: Ah, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question! Judge: Indeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: S-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand? Oldbag: Ah, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand. Phoenix: Then how about his left? Oldbag: Empty. Phoenix: ... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...) Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all. Judge: *sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn. Oldbag: You've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me! Phoenix: (And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)

There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...) Leads back to cross-examination The person's clothes Phoenix: Please tell the court about the man's clothes in more detail! Oldbag: What a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters. Phoenix: But it does. Oldbag: Um... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing. Phoenix: What thing? Oldbag: That gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket. Phoenix: (Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...) Oldbag: That thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!! Phoenix: Um, right... Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all. Judge: *sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn. Oldbag: You've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!

Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important! Phoenix: Don't you see it, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Your Honor! I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony. Judge: Hmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please... Oldbag: Ah well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must... Adds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"Press (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!? Oldbag: Yessey! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Annoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person! Phoenix: (Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)Oldbag: He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket? Oldbag: What do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it! Phoenix: (She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)Present Jammin' Ninja's Button Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Oldbag...\"Mia: She may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.Phoenix: That's bad for us. Really bad.Mia: But, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix: (That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag...Oldbag: What!? Don't say my name for no reason!Phoenix: Do you know what this is?Oldbag: Aaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!Phoenix: (Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)Oldbag: Give it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Phoenix: (Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag: See! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix: It was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag: See! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix: ...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag: ... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge: Now hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag: But when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag: Edgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth: Well, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix: Just say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge: Witness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!Oldbag: *sigh* Alright, if you insist.Phoenix: (I should be the one sighing, not you!)Witness Testimony-- Who I Saw --Oldbag: Engarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember! The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw! Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder. He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know. So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Phoenix: I... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!Oldbag: What? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix: But... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag: Ah, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge: H-How do you know that?Oldbag: Because... I said so. And what I say is the truth.Phoenix: (At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)Judge: Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Who I Saw --Oldbag: Engarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Would you please get on with your testimony! Oldbag: Hmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs! Phoenix: Uh, what? Oldbag: \"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\" Phoenix: (...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!? Edgeworth: Witness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts. Oldbag: OKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!? Edgeworth: Wright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date. Phoenix: (Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)Oldbag: The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Be a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!? Oldbag: \"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream? Phoenix: ...Huh? Oldbag: What did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!? Phoenix: My dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!? Oldbag: See! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!? Phoenix: Well... Oldbag: \"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"! Phoenix: (Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?) Oldbag: All that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?Oldbag: Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why would that be? Oldbag: That way, no one could see his face, of course! Phoenix: But there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more! Oldbag: ... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say... Phoenix: (Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?) Oldbag: I got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag: He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show? Oldbag: Well, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing. Phoenix: And that included the Jammin' Ninja...? Oldbag: Of course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought. Judge: Hmm... I see. Oldbag: Well, anyway.Oldbag: So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai? Oldbag: As showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!? Phoenix: (Can I throw in the towel yet?)Present Knife Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please take a look at this.\"Phoenix: Hmm...Mia: You don't need to think too hard on this one.Phoenix: Huh?Mia: There's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...Phoenix: (Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)-- Secret Information --Oldbag: That Engarde is one evil, evil man!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You can't say something like that without proof! That's just slander! Oldbag: But it's true! That woman was getting intimate with poor Juan! Look! It says so right here, doesn't it!? \"Manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\" Phoenix: But the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"... Oldbag: What? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth! Phoenix: Um... Oldbag: Honestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip! Judge: Yes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?) Oldbag: Anyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touch\u00e9\"!Oldbag: He thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A scandal...? What do you mean by that? Oldbag: You're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...? Phoenix: Ah, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much! Oldbag: Well! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!Oldbag: So to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing! Oldbag: You must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth. And now, since you're in so much shock, you can't do anything right! Phoenix: (You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.) Oldbag: Alright then, sonny, show me what you've got! Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!? Present evidence Phoenix: I'm not going to let you push me around that easily! Oldbag: Heh. There's many a man who've said those exact words and paid dearly for them. Phoenix: Maybe you should brace yourself this time! Here is my proof that Mr. Engarde did not hold any ill-will towards the victim! Present anything Phoenix: Oldbag: ...Is that it? You can take it from here, Edgey-poo! Edgeworth: Ngrk! Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!? (Changed from [EH!? Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!?] in the original release) Oldbag: I want you to give that jagged-headed baboon-boy a message for me! Please? Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing. Edgeworth: Um... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy! Judge: Yes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy. Phoenix: (Did I just gain a new nickname here...?) Leads to: \"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\" Decline the offer to present Phoenix: ...I don't have anything to offer. Oldbag: Seeeeeee! Just as I thought. Leads to: \"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\" Oldbag: And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof! You've just given me a free pass to say whatever I want whenever I want, silly boy! Phoenix: (Me and my big mouth...) Oldbag: That's the way the cookie crumbles. For you, anyway.Oldbag: I cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...? Oldbag: Like I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need! Judge: You were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...? Oldbag: I was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this! Judge: N-No, stop! Oldbag: Well, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.Oldbag: ...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait! Oldbag: What!? I'm a busy woman! Tea time with the kids is over! Phoenix: Secret information that no one else knows yet... If that's true, then how do you know this \"secret information\"!? Oldbag: Huh!? Well... That's... because I'm a pro... Yes, that's it... Phoenix: ... Oldbag: I-It's a secret! Even if you drill a hole into my brain, you'll never find out! Phoenix: (How in the world did that old bat get such a \"secret\" piece of information...?) Press further Phoenix: If you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today! Oldbag: Umm... Edgey-boy! What are you doing!? Help me! Edgeworth: Eh!? What do I have to do with this!? Oldbag: Just do this for me... You'll get your reward. Edgeworth: Hmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head! Phoenix: (And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?) Judge: As long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning. Phoenix: (Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!) Leads back to cross-examination Present evidence Phoenix: So no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...? Oldbag: Wh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that! Phoenix: Witness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release) Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"! Judge: Objection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue. Oldbag: Okie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down! Phoenix: (Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...) Leads back to cross-examination Wait and see Phoenix: (I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...) Leads back to cross-examinationMia: Sounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.Phoenix: (Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)Mia: There has to be something we can catch her on...Phoenix: (Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)Phoenix: The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...Judge: Oh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.Phoenix: She reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.Judge: She reported such a thing...?Phoenix: On that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.Oldbag: Wh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?Phoenix: No no no, I said impressions.Oldbag: Then... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?Phoenix: Ah! That's it! That's the note!Oldbag: Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!Judge: Hmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?Oldbag: I'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!Phoenix: ...Judge: ...Edgeworth: ...Oldbag: ... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?Edgeworth: Nngh...Oldbag: I was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!Edgeworth: You really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.Judge: Well, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.Phoenix: (She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)Pile on more pressure. Phoenix: (If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!) Leads to: \"Witness!\"Forgive her. Phoenix: I guess we should forgive her. Oldbag: Hmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent! Phoenix: Grr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.) Mia: Phoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Mia: You should be pressing her until she gives in! Phoenix: (Mia is really scary today... *gulp*) Leads to: \"Witness!\"Phoenix: Witness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?Oldbag: S-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!Phoenix: You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!Oldbag: Are you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Oldbag!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Hmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling? Phoenix: Um... Judge: I'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections! Phoenix: (Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!) Leads back to: \"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?Judge: A camera...?Phoenix: Yesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"Judge: Why... Why... Witness!!Oldbag: What is it, gramps?Phoenix: If you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!Oldbag: Grr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?Phoenix: Ah, that's...!Oldbag: What!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!Judge: Um... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...Oldbag: I saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!Judge: Bailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?Edgeworth: There is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.Judge: Please present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!Oldbag: See, I told you! That's the guy I saw!Judge: This proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.Judge: Wh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth: This photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge: If that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth: The defendant.Judge: How did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix: (If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it. Phoenix: There is nothing strange with this photo. Edgeworth: Hmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright. Judge: I see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial. Mia: Is this really alright with you, Phoenix!? Phoenix: W-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi-- Mia: Try again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor! Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards. Phoenix: Um, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait... Edgeworth: Oh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo? Judge: Wh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!? Leads to: \"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it. Leads to: \"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix: There's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth: I knew this was coming, Wright.Judge: Your thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: I think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge: \"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: ... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge: If you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix: Um... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)Judge: Now then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?Present Nickel Samurai's feet Phoenix: Leads to: \"I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\"Present Nickel Samurai Phoenix: Phoenix: It's this person here, of course! Judge: You mean the \"Nickel Samurai\"? And what is wrong with that? Phoenix: At the time of the murder, Mr. Engarde was in his own room! Which means this Nickel Samurai is a fa-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you think that's all it takes, you should reconsider your choice of occupation. Phoenix: Urk. Edgeworth: I think it's about time you retired! Judge: Hmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all. Edgeworth: The problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor. Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: You are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright! Infinite penaltyPresent anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: The strange thing is somewhere around here! ...I think. Edgeworth: \"Somewhere\"...? Judge: \"Around here\"...? Mia: \"I think\"...? Phoenix: A-Am I seeing something you all are not...? Judge: Hmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all. Edgeworth: The problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor. Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: You are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright! Infinite penaltyPhoenix: I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!Judge: Wh-What are you pointing to? His ankles...?Phoenix: If you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.Judge: A-And...? What does that mean...?Phoenix: The costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)Judge: What is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.Phoenix: Let's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge: His... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix: Exactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: There is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia: That's curious...Phoenix: Huh? What is?Mia: Edgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix: That's true...Mia: He's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix: \"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia: I can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix: (He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth: ...Judge: If the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix: WHAT!?Edgeworth: Wright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix: (Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia: Don't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix: (Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge: Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?Present Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Are you saying this is who you think was in the costume...? Phoenix: Uh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see? Mia: I can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places... Phoenix: (Argh... And I really thought I had it!) Judge: Now then, would you care to try one more time? Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"Judge: A-Adrian Andrews...?Phoenix: If you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!Edgeworth: And why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix: For starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge: And how does that all add up?Phoenix: It means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge: The knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth: Why don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix: (I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!Judge: Order! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor?Judge: This court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: (Alright! This is it...)Mia: This... is kind of bad for us.Phoenix: Huh? What do you mean?Mia: If Adrian Andrews is summoned to court as a witness... It means that the trial will go on for another day.Phoenix: One more day...? Ack!!

I request that you please continue with today's trial.Judge: B-But... We cannot continue due to this unexpected development!Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk. \"Unexpected\" development? I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.Judge: And what do you mean by that...?Edgeworth: That Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan... Even if Wright was a bit slow to catch on...Phoenix: Wh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge: What is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth: Ms. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.Phoenix: ...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)Mia: Somehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.Edgeworth: Exactly.Judge: Very well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess.

I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix: She is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde: So after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix: See, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde: Hmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix: Yes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde: But... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix: She has her own agenda.Engarde: H-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix: I'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde: Get me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia: Phoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix: ...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia: ...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix: And that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia: That sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix: Um, what...?Mia: Who was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)Phoenix: ...

Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth: The prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!Edgeworth: What is your occupation?Andrews: I am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge: I see. Now then...Andrews: Before we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge: Uh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews: I'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge: Ah, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix: (If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth: Anyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews: Yes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge: Hmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews: But I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth: No one has accused you of that.Andrews: I think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix: ...!Judge: I think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth: Very well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews: It was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room. After that, I went to Juan's room. And there was his dead body. I... I was in shock... What I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo. I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.Judge: You poured yourself a glass of juice...?Andrews: Yes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth: And that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge: I see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia: Phoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix: Yes... I know.Mia: In order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix: Disrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia: She's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews: It was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...? Andrews: He was taking a nap. He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony... Phoenix: (Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes? Andrews: Excuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room? Andrews: ...No. Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Subject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.Andrews: After that, I went to Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you do that...? Andrews: As a friendly gesture, Juan was to make an appearance with the other Heroes. Phoenix: (So the show was supposed to be a \"show\" of friendship, huh?) Press further Phoenix: Is that the only reason? Andrews: I beg your pardon? What are you implying...? Phoenix: You had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...? Andrews: ... Sorry, but I didn't have any such intentions in mind at that time. Phoenix: (I can't get her to talk without a strong piece of evidence, I guess...) Leads to: \"May we continue now...?\" Let her be Phoenix: (I should back off... As long as I don't have any proof, she's not going to talk.) Leads to: \"May we continue now...?\" Edgeworth: May we continue now...?

Was I not supposed to be? Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...) Edgeworth: Anyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.

Press further Leads to: \"Ms. Andrews!\" Let her be Phoenix: (Well, it probably doesn't have anything to do with the case, so...) Mia: Stop right there.

Edgeworth: Wh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!? Andrews: I'm sorry... I thought that since the crime scene was already in disarray, that people would simply assume the vase was just another part of the mess. Judge: It looks like yet another fact has come to light here.

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of characters, evidence, and testimonies from the Ace Attorney game. The task is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. \n\nLooking at the testimonies given by Adrian Andrews, specifically testimony 3: \"What I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\" She claims that when she entered the room, everything was already as shown in the crime photo.\n\nNow, the evidence list includes the Guitar Case (Evidence 6), which mentions that there's water on top of the lid. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows an open guitar case on the floor with a smashed vase, which would have spilled water onto the case. However, Andrews' testimony 5 says she knocked over the vase onto the guitar case when she entered. But according to her initial testimony (testimony 3), the scene was exactly like the photo when she arrived. If she caused the vase to fall, then the scene she saw wasn't exactly as in the photo because her action changed it. Therefore, the Guitar Case evidence (6) showing water from the vase contradicts her testimony 3 that the scene was unchanged when she arrived. The contradiction is that her own action (knocking over the vase) altered the scene, so the crime photo includes her alteration, meaning the scene wasn't the same as when she first saw it."

Pearl: Um, but what if... What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: ... Pearl: Would you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...? Phoenix: Pearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing. Pearl: Y-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it... Maya's situation Phoenix: Pearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you? Pearl: I... I don't have anyone else left in this world. Phoenix: What do you mean...? Pearl: My family's all gone... Phoenix: (...Her family...) Pearl: My father... He left my mother and the village behind and went away. Phoenix: I'm sorry... Pearl: And... my mother... She did that thing... all for me... Phoenix: ... Pearl: Mystic Maya... She's like a sister to me... ... She is all I have left in this world... Present Anything Phoenix: Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (She looks out of it... Maybe I should leave her alone...) March 21, 8:57 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (We couldn't wait for visiting hours to start, so Pearls and I came down here early... To visit one Nickel Samurai, charged with the murder of the Jammin' Ninja...) Engarde: ... Phoenix: G-Good morning. How are you today? Engarde: ... Phoenix: I know this situation might be a little tough for you... Engarde: ... Phoenix: Um... We're... Engarde: Oh, sorry dude... Phoenix: ...? Engarde: I already signed up... Phoenix: E-Excuse me...? Engarde: I already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know... Phoenix: ... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople! Engarde: Really...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either. Phoenix: ...? Engarde: Fire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so... Phoenix: ... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright. Engarde: A lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ... Pearl: The Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he? Phoenix: (I think \"strange\" is an understatement.) Engarde: Sorry about that. You're just in time. Phoenix: Huh!? Engarde: You're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it? Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! This is our chance! Phoenix: (I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!) Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star? Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator. Talk Matt Engarde Phoenix: Sorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions. Engarde: Um, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ... Pearl: Mr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to. Phoenix: (Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...) Engarde: Sorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude. Phoenix: (Does he have a mind of his own!?) What happened Phoenix: Mr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder... Engarde: Oh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff... Phoenix: No no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid... Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ... Pearl: Is he alright, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: (If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.) Engarde: Sorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\" Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...? Phoenix: It's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects. Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Mr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge. Engarde: Dude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that. Phoenix: ...Huh? Engarde: I'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now. Engarde: I don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course... Phoenix: (Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!) Press Conference Ticket Engarde: ...? What's that? Phoenix: It's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right? Engarde: Huh? Me? Phoenix: Yes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release) Engarde: Um, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager. Phoenix: (He didn't know...? That's odd...) Radio Transceiver Pearl: ...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that? Phoenix: I don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him... Engarde: Is that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too. Phoenix: I got it as a \"present\" from someone. Engarde: Hmm? Interesting. Phoenix: I've also been instructed to take your case. Engarde: Is that what you heard from the transceiver? Phoenix: Yes. Engarde: Dude, that's terrible! Don't let some disembodied voice boss you around! Phoenix: (This coming from a man with a cell phone on his wrist...) Will Powers profile Engarde: I've seen him somewhere before... Is he a member of my fan club? Phoenix: That's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you? Engarde: Powers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day. Phoenix: (He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...) Juan Corrida profile Engarde: Man, it's too bad he's dead... Phoenix: You killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree? Engarde: Dude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake. Phoenix: If that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!? Engarde: Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ... Pearl: Stars sure know a lot of people, don't they? Phoenix: (I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...) Engarde: ...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all. Phoenix: (Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!) Matt Engarde profile Engarde: Yeah... I'm such a handsome devil. Phoenix: Uh... Um, yeah... Engarde: And I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing... Dude, it's no wonder I'm so popular. Phoenix: Uh... Um, yeah... (You're also good at sitting in a jail cell, Mr. Popular.) Any other evidence Engarde: Dude, I know I like to throw money around, but it's not like I buy anything and everything. Phoenix: (That's nice, because it's not up for sale anyway!) Any other profile Engarde: Um, dude, this person looks like a member of my fan club. Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the fan club president, OK? ... ... Phoenix: Um, \"dude\", you know what...? Forget I asked... After clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver: Engarde: ... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going. Phoenix: Please, wait! ...I really need to take your case! Engarde: There's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few? Pearl: Please! Please let Mr. Nick represent you! Engarde: Man, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too? Phoenix: If you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...! Engarde: ... Wait... What did you just say? Phoenix: \"De Killer\"... Engarde: D-De Killer!? Phoenix: (...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...) Engarde: ... Alright, dude. I accept your terms. Phoenix: Huh? Engarde: I'll let you represent me in court. Pearl: W-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Uh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...) Engarde: Go ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can... Talk Matt Engarde Engarde: Man, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name. Phoenix: Well, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight. Pearl: I didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...? Engarde: Ah, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular. Phoenix: (True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...) Engarde: Do you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am. Pearl: A spring breeze... Engarde: That's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad. Phoenix: (But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release) What happened Phoenix: Can you tell me about your activities last night? Engarde: After I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume. Phoenix: And you were alone the entire time? Engarde: My manager was running around being busy, so yeah. Phoenix: Because of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show? Engarde: I told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright? Phoenix: (That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...) Engarde: Anyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy... Phoenix: Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time...? Engarde: Yeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager. Phoenix: (I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release) Engarde: And that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me. The victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\") Phoenix: About you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of... Engarde: That's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail. Phoenix: The Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right? Engarde: Yeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know? The charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... Do you know why you were arrested? Engarde: I guess maybe my full body search went badly. Phoenix: Did they find something on you? Engarde: They found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume. Phoenix: A button...? Engarde: I don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\". Pearl: Aaah! Engarde: Dude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious. Phoenix: (I wonder if that's what really happened...?) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...) Pearl: Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah? Pearl: Let's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not... Phoenix: W-We can do that...? Pearl: Yes. If you use this... Phoenix: (Maya's Magatama!) Pearl: He won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it. Phoenix: (I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly. Engarde: What is it, dude? Phoenix: Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida? Engarde: ... Phoenix: Please put the phone away and answer this question yourself. Engarde: Alright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK? Phoenix: ... Pearl: Well, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Nothing. Not a chain or lock in sight. Pearl: Which means... I think it is alright to trust him. Phoenix: (Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.) Engarde: Um... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude. To be continued. March 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Well, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important... Pearl: So! So now what should we do!? Phoenix: Well, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer. Pearl: OK! Then let's start looking! Examine Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...? Charley the plant Pearl: Oh! I'll water it! Phoenix: Ah, it's OK... I already did that... Pearl: ...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...? Phoenix: (Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...) Poster Pearl: This is the Nickel Samurai... right? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, that's right. Pearl: Mr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!? Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. Pearl: Oh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either... Phoenix: I-It's OK, Pearls. Really. Desk Phoenix: My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean... Pearl: Oh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep... Talk What to do Phoenix: Since there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent. Pearl: I really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\" Any ideas Phoenix: Hey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls. Pearl: OK, what is it? Phoenix: Why are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go-- Pearl: Huh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...! Phoenix: (Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...) Pearl: Mr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me! Phoenix: (Ow! She slapped me!!) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: That's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it? Phoenix: I guess? Pearl: I feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama... Phoenix: (Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...) Maya Fey profile Pearl: Oh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright... Phoenix: I'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me. Pearl: If there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!? Pearl Fey profile Pearl: To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me. Phoenix: I think your hair now suits you perfectly. Pearl: R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget* Phoenix: *fidget, fidget* Dick Gumshoe profile Pearl: I'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked! Phoenix: Yeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.) Will Powers profile Pearl: He's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he? Phoenix: (Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...? Pearl: What about you, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...) Anything else Pearl: Um, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training. Phoenix: Ah, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself... Pearl: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry! March 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Engarde: Ah, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out? Phoenix: Um, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating... Engarde: I see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude. Present Press Conference Ticket Engarde: Dude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager. Phoenix: (...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...) Radio Transceiver Engarde: So, why are you carrying around that transceiver...? Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about it. Engarde: And why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude. Phoenix: (On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret. Engarde: OK, whatever, dude. Juan Corrida profile Engarde: Look, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him. Pearl: Being rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person... March 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby Oldbag: Hey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without... Pearl: Good morning. Oldbag: Hold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!? Phoenix: U-Uh... Um... Oldbag: I heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds. Phoenix: Um, you know... That's not entirely... Oldbag: I'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt. Phoenix: Um... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened... Oldbag: Hmph! Don't push me, boy! Pearl: Um... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast... Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...? Oldbag: Don't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants! Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* Examine Stage Phoenix: It's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but... Pearl: ...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh? Phoenix: (How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?) Talk The victim Oldbag: My dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again. Phoenix: ...I don't know what to say... Oldbag: I ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket? Phoenix: Umm... Oldbag: I'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan! Phoenix: But I haven't said anything... Oldbag: Well, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway! Phoenix: Huh? What woman? Oldbag: That irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or Phoenix: ...Pearls? Are you thirsty? Pearl: Um, a little. Phoenix: OK. I'll go get you some juice or something. Pearl: Th-Thank you very much. Oldbag: Hey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today! Phoenix: (So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...) What happened Phoenix: I want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder... Oldbag: Ah, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready. Phoenix: Getting ready? For what...? Oldbag: The show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards. Phoenix: (Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.) Oldbag: Anyway, I don't know anything about the murder. Phoenix: Ah, I see... Oldbag: ... But. Phoenix: ? Oldbag: But if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly! Pearl: What!? Oldbag: I saw the most important moment of the night! What you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Th-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!? Oldbag: Oh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today. Phoenix: Please tell me! What did you see!? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Oldbag: The murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't? Phoenix: (Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...) Oldbag: If you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present! What you witnessed (subsequent times) Phoenix: Please tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!? Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...* 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: P-Please! Mystic Maya's life is... Oldbag: Ah, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph! Phoenix: (What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!) Present Anything Oldbag: I don't have anything to say to delinquents like you! Phoenix: (Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...) Pearl: Please! Anything would be helpful! Oldbag: Well then, how about I tell you my measurements? Phoenix: ...Um... No, that's okay... Really. Pearl: She really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I know, I know... March 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall Phoenix: Looks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens. Pearl: I wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere... Phoenix: ...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess. Examine Doors on left Phoenix: There's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together... Chandelier Pearl: That is such a beautiful sight. Phoenix: The chandelier? Pearl: Yes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking. Stage Phoenix: The awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous. Pearl: You just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright. Phoenix: (I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls. Front table Pearl: We ate at this table last night, didn't we? Phoenix: Yes. Pearl: I was really happy then. Phoenix: (I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...) March 21Gatewater HotelHallway Lotta: Hey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer! Phoenix: Lotta... Lotta: Hey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face! Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What!? Lotta: Arrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty! Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright? Lotta: Looked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release) Pearl: Um, what are you looking for...? Lotta: My CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!! Phoenix: Y-Your camera...? Lotta: Look, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are! Phoenix: Yep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble. Pearl: Huh!? Examine Teddy bear Phoenix: I can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Lotta: I didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word! Phoenix: (Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?) Flowers on left Phoenix: Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think... Lotta: Yeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course. Phoenix: (I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...) Door on left Phoenix: There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". Lotta: So that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder. Door on right Phoenix: There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". Pearl: So Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right? Phoenix: That's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.) Talk Camera Phoenix: So you lost your camera...? Lotta: It ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new! Pearl: Huh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700? Lotta: I had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that! Pearl: When did you lose your camera? Lotta: Last night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie! Phoenix: Lotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours? Lotta: I don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop. Phoenix: (I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?) Lotta's Camera added to the Court Record. Camera (subsequent times) Phoenix: So you lost your camera...? Lotta: It ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new! Pearl: Huh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700? Lotta: I had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that! Pearl: When did you lose your camera? Lotta: Last night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie! Phoenix: Lotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours? Lotta: I don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop. Phoenix: (I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?) What happened Phoenix: Lotta, please tell me what you know about what happened at the time of the murder. Lotta: Well, from before the ceremony last night, I was hangin' around here in this area. Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested. Phoenix: What were you doing here...? Lotta: You sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had! Phoenix: A big scoop...? Lotta: I told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot! Phoenix: (I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?) Lotta: Although, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time... Big scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\") Phoenix: Lotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop? Lotta: Well... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof? Phoenix: What kind of story was it that you would hang around here...? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Lotta: Oops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know? Phoenix: (Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?) Pearl: We've been stopped, haven't we? Lotta: Ha ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer! Phoenix: (I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...) Big scoop (subsequent times) Phoenix: You were on the hunt for your big scoop last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Lotta: It's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder. Pearl: It looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks. Phoenix: Yeah... I guess so. Present Press Conference Ticket Lotta: Hey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!? Phoenix: P-Please don't direct your anger at me... Lotta: Why in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!? Phoenix: (...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?) Pearl: Are you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!? Lotta's Camera Lotta: Nngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal! Phoenix: Please don't look straight at me while you're saying that... Lotta: When I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet! Phoenix: (And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...) Maya Fey profile Lotta: Now that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...? Pearl: Um... Lotta: She's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now... Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk...) Pearl: ... Pearl Fey profile Lotta: Ah, just wanna say sorry to ya. Pearl: For...? Lotta: Well, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer. Pearl: ...Huh? Lotta: You know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey... Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What!? But why!? Lotta: I mean, you were all worked up, ya know? Pearl: *sniffle* ...Meanie... Phoenix: Lotta, that was very insensitive of you! Lotta Hart profile Lotta: This kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot! Pearl: Wow, that's really lucky! Phoenix: (*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...) Juan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile Lotta: I don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot. Pearl: Oh, I see... Lotta: And shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me... Pearl: O-Oh... Lotta: Sounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this! Phoenix: W-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that! Security Lady profile Lotta: This old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know... Phoenix: (A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.) Anything else Phoenix: Um... Do you know anything... Lotta: ...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there! Pearl: Please don't get so worked up over this... Lotta: Hah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters. March 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room Pearl: Um... Where are we? Phoenix: We're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room. ???: May I help you with something? Phoenix: Um, uh... We're... ???: You're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail. Phoenix: Um... How did you know I'm his lawyer...? ???: You were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer. Pearl: Wow... ???: It's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct? Phoenix: Well, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either. Pearl: It's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick. Andrews: I am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business. Phoenix: A-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...) Examine Red suitcase Phoenix: It's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here. Pearl: Stars really are different from us, aren't they...? Bedroom Phoenix: That's the bedroom over there. Pearl: That's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here! Sofa Phoenix: There's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here. Pearl: Um, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\". Phoenix: (Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...) Table Phoenix: Looks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that. Pearl: I'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates. Phoenix: Looks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...? Plate on right Phoenix: There's a giant bone sitting on the plate. Pearl: I... I don't really like meat... Phoenix: (...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...) Talk Night of the murder Andrews: I assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct? Phoenix: Y-Yes, that is correct. Andrews: Then I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add. Phoenix: \"Dinner\"? What did you eat? Andrews: I told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me. Phoenix: (...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...) Andrews: When the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall. Phoenix: And after the show ended, you came back to this room...? Andrews: No, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby. Phoenix: Oh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...) Andrews: When it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida... Phoenix: And that's when you found his body, isn't it? Andrews: ... Pearl: You really held strong through everything... Phoenix: (Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...) Relation to Engarde Phoenix: Um, so... About you and... Andrews: Stop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release) Phoenix: S-Sorry... Andrews: I have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Why did she have to go and say something like that...?) Pearl: Mr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright? Andrews: I already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager. Phoenix: His manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one? Andrews: No, he did not. Phoenix: He didn't? Andrews: Global Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars. Phoenix: I see... Andrews: This industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly. Pearl: You're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...! Phoenix: Pearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright? Pearl: Nngh... Motive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile) Phoenix: Do you have any ideas? Andrews: As to...? Phoenix: As to why Mr. Corrida was murdered? Andrews: Why would you ask me about such a thing...? Phoenix: I'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: M-Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: Sorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation. Pearl: Is it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately. Motive for murder (subsequent times) Phoenix: You know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered... 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Andrews: Why are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart. Phoenix: (No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.) Pearl: If you don't remove her locks... Phoenix: (Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...) Present Press Conference Ticket Phoenix: You were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right? Andrews: Yes, that's right. Pearl: But Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it. Andrews: ... Is that what he said...? Pearl: Huh...? Andrews: Actually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked. Pearl: Oh... I see. Phoenix: (I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.) Will Powers profile Andrews: That's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be. Phoenix: (Urk... What a horrible thing to say...) Andrews: ...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...) Pearl: I wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews... Juan Corrida profile Phoenix: Did you know the victim, Mr. Corrida? Andrews: Yes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all. Pearl: Did you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai? Andrews: Honestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release) Phoenix: ! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!) Matt Engarde profile Andrews: I asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition. Phoenix: (Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...) Pearl: He's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick? Andrews: ... Adrian Andrews profile Andrews: I hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why. Phoenix: S-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...) Anything else Phoenix: Um, I'd like to ask you about this... Andrews: I told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me. Phoenix: (Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...) March 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room Pearl: Mr. Nick... Where are we...? Phoenix: We're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls. Pearl: Mr. Corrida...? Phoenix: The victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too. Gumshoe: Oh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!? Phoenix: Not yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal. Gumshoe: Umm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there? Phoenix: (I just want Maya to be alright...) Pearl: ... Gumshoe: We don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal. Phoenix: Can you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...? Gumshoe: Just this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here. Phoenix: Thank you. Gumshoe: Oh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy. Pearl: Wow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you! Gumshoe: Ha ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good. Pearl: Mr. Nick! I got a map! Phoenix: That's great, Pearls! Pearl: ... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says... Hotel Guidemap added to the Court Record. Examine Refrigerator Phoenix: There are all sorts of things in this refrigerator... Pearl: The carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty... Phoenix: Empty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut. Pearl: ...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too! Phoenix: Maybe red was his favorite color...? Stuffed bears Pearl: Wow, there are a lot of bears! Phoenix: (Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?) Pearl: There's even a few in the trash can... Phoenix: Yeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears. Pearl: Poor teddies... It's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Phoenix: ... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...) Pearl: What's wrong, Mr. Nick? Desk Pearl: Hmph! It's so messy here! Phoenix: (Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...) Pearl: There are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please? Phoenix: OK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist. Pearl: ... I know what a watch is... Phoenix: (Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...) Blue suitcase Phoenix: It's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator... Pearl: Do all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida? Table on right Phoenix: It looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night. Pearl: This bottle... It's tomato juice. Phoenix: (We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...) Bedroom Pearl: So that's a bed, right? Phoenix: Yup. It's big, but it's a bed. Pearl: Aaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft! Phoenix: (Big beds must be a rarity for her...) Scattered items near guitar case Phoenix: Bottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant. Pearl: What's this glass fragment from...? Phoenix: A flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are. Pearl: You don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick? Guitar case Phoenix: This is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable. Pearl: That's strange. The guitar is not here... Phoenix: Maybe he forgot to bring it to the show? Pearl: But Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item... Phoenix: (That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid... Pearl: Yeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...? Guitar Case added to the Court Record. Guitar case (subsequent times) Phoenix: This is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable. Pearl: That's strange. The guitar is not here... Phoenix: Maybe he forgot to bring it to the show? Pearl: But Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item... Phoenix: (That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid... Pearl: Yeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...? Wine glass Phoenix: It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it. Pearl: Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much. Phoenix: There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from. Pearl: But doesn't it seem weird? Phoenix: ...What seems weird? Pearl: I mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor. Phoenix: ... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.) Pearl: Why is this glass the only thing that's still alright...? Wine Glass added to the Court Record. Wine glass (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it. Pearl: Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much. Phoenix: There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from. Pearl: But doesn't it seem weird? Phoenix: ...What seems weird? Pearl: I mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor. Phoenix: ... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.) Pearl: Why is this glass the only thing that's still alright...? Talk Cause of death Phoenix: Do you know what was the cause of death? Gumshoe: Well, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release) Phoenix: It should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah. Here's a picture. Phoenix: There's a knife in his chest. Gumshoe: Yeah, pal, that's the murder weapon. Phoenix: (So he was stabbed to death...) Gumshoe: They're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now. Phoenix: There were fingerprints on the knife? Gumshoe: Yup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal. Phoenix: (That's bad... Real bad...) Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Cause of death (subsequent times) Phoenix: Do you know what was the cause of death? Gumshoe: Well, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release) Phoenix: It should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah. Here's a picture. Phoenix: There's a knife in his chest. Gumshoe: Yeah, pal, that's the murder weapon. Phoenix: (So he was stabbed to death...) Gumshoe: They're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now. Phoenix: There were fingerprints on the knife? Gumshoe: Yup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal. Phoenix: (That's bad... Real bad...) Reason for arrest Phoenix: Why was Mr. Engarde arrested? Gumshoe: Because we had evidence on him. Pearl: Evidence...? Gumshoe: It looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight. Phoenix: Yeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere. Gumshoe: Well, yeah. During the fight, his button came off... Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...) Gumshoe: But that's not all... Phoenix: What!? Gumshoe: There was a witness, pal. Phoenix: A witness!? Wh-Who is it!? Gumshoe: That lady... Ms. Oldbag. Phoenix: (Please... Anyone but her!) Gumshoe: The prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release) Phoenix: Something that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: As in, that's for you to figure out, pal! Pearl: Alright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick! Present Radio Transceiver Gumshoe: That's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that... Pearl: Yeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is! Phoenix: (It uses radio waves, huh?) Gumshoe: I got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal! Guitar Case Phoenix: What can you tell me about this guitar case? Gumshoe: Oh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item. Phoenix: The guitar case? Gumshoe: No, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course! Pearl: But... The guitar is missing. Gumshoe: Yeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show. Phoenix: (It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...) Wine Glass Phoenix: So about this wine glass... Gumshoe: Ah, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched. Phoenix: You noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...? Gumshoe: No, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first. Phoenix: Yeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release) Phoenix: You can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash. Crime Photo Gumshoe: You look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\" Phoenix: (Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: I'm sorry. Phoenix: ...For what? Gumshoe: I really want to help you look for her, pal. Pearl: Mr. Detective... Gumshoe: If anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can! Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey, little missy. Listen good, OK? Pearl: OK. What is it? Gumshoe: Don't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it. Pearl: Huh!? Gumshoe: If you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK? Phoenix: (Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...) Lotta Hart profile Gumshoe: If I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see. Phoenix: ...Because I'm in the number one spot? Gumshoe: Don't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Really? Then who's in first...? Gumshoe: Ms. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race. Phoenix: O-Oh... Gumshoe: She's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't... Phoenix: (He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...) Matt Engarde profile Gumshoe: Hey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so. Phoenix: One dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money? Gumshoe: I... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's... Phoenix: (It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!) Pearl: Mr. Nick... Security Lady profile Gumshoe: I thought she was an alien from outer space. Phoenix: Yeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet. Gumshoe: Nah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal. Phoenix: ... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean... Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: She's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\". Phoenix: Yeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together. Gumshoe: Compared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up. Phoenix: (I feel sort of bad for him...) Anything else Phoenix: What do you know about this? Gumshoe: Um... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast... After clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass: ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... Pearl: Wh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: (Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...) Gumshoe: It's Ms. von Karma... Pearl: Huh? Gumshoe: For some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release) Gumshoe: S-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww! von Karma: At last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?) von Karma: So you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you! Phoenix: (Owww!) von Karma: Hey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat! Gumshoe: Ah! von Karma: I didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful... Gumshoe: Uwaah! von Karma: Detective! Come over here for a second! Gumshoe: Yeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow! von Karma: ...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment. Phoenix: (He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...) von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine! Phoenix: ... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...? von Karma: Wh-What...!? Phoenix: ... von Karma: ... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! von Karma: This isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor! Phoenix: (Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?) Gumshoe: ...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you... Examine Paper on desk Pearl: Mr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...? Phoenix: It's called an \"autograph\". Pearl: Auto-graff? Phoenix: It's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph. Pearl: I can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this. Phoenix: Ah, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here? Pearl: Th-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone! Phoenix: (Hold on...) Pearl: ...? Phoenix: Wendy... I've heard that name somewhere before... Mr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record. After visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room: March 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall Powers: Oh, Mr. Wright! How are you? Phoenix: Ah, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time? Powers: Yeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave... Talk The Nickel Samurai Phoenix: Can you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show? Powers: OK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\". Phoenix: I see... Powers: This time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo! Phoenix: I see... ... W-Wait... A love what...? Powers: A love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time. Phoenix: Oh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl? Powers: Anyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader! Phoenix: Sounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three. Powers: Y-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies. Pearl: Um... Powers: Yes, Pearl? Pearl: Wh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she? Powers: Every Sunday at 8 AM. Pearl: I'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week! Phoenix: (I can't believe she's really considering it!) Jammin' Ninja Phoenix: So what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like? Powers: It started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star. Phoenix: ...Uh, what? Powers: He was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm. Phoenix: A... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!? Powers: And then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3! Phoenix: Aww, that's too bad for him... Powers: Y-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like. Pearl: Um... Powers: Yes, Pearl? Pearl: Wh-What happens next!? I want to know! Pearl: Jammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!? Powers: Every Sunday at 8 AM. Pearl: Umm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...

Present Radio Transceiver Powers: I can't believe it... A kidnapping... Pearl: Do you remember what the person looked like who gave this to you? Powers: It was that bellboy. And... And I didn't suspect a thing because he looked like such a normal old man... Phoenix: (Old man, huh...) Guitar Case Powers: That guitar case... That was Juan's... Phoenix: I'm guessing you've seen this case before? Powers: It's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar. Phoenix: (The bright red guitar... The Jammin' Ninja's signature item.) Pearl: But if the guitar is so important, how could he forget it for the award ceremony? Phoenix: (That does seem a little strange...) Maya Fey profile Powers: I... I'm sure he won't hurt her and he'll let her go soon... Phoenix: Yeah... Powers: Mr. Wright. I believe in you. You will save her! Phoenix: Thanks. Security Lady profile Powers: I never would've thought I'd see her here of all places. The last time we saw each other was during that really bad incident... You know... I mean, when I look back now, I think of the good things, so it's not so bad, I guess. Phoenix: Yeah, I would love to go back in time and relive a few of those good things... *chuckle* Powers: Th-That's not funny... Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess not...)

Powers: There's sort of a small rumor going around about her right now... Pearl: A rumor...? Powers: Ah! If you're interested, I can give you a little bit of the details!

Oldbag: I tell you, I saw him that night. I saw him coming out of Juan's room. Phoenix: You're kidding! Pearl: Oh no! Oldbag: It was about ten minutes before Juan's body was discovered. It was just a coincidence. I was on my way to the toilet, minding my own business. Phoenix: And...? Did you tell that to the police? Oldbag: Well, of course! I thought I could get a gift certificate or two out of it, maybe more. Pearl: Gift certificate...? Oldbag: I've been recruited again for that part at the trial. You know, the trial tomorrow? This time, you're gonna get it! I'm gonna work hard to get your client pronounced guilty! Pearl: But Mr. Engarde hasn't done anything bad... Oldbag: I don't care about details like that! I know he did my dear poor Juan in! I just do! That yellow-bellied chicken! Pearl: A yellow-bellied chicken...? I wonder what that would look like... Oldbag: I trust my senses. I know when someone did something bad, and I say he did it! Phoenix: (What did Mr. Engarde ever do to her to deserve this...?)

That guy, he shoved the girl onto Juan on purpose! Phoenix: His own manager? But why...? Oldbag: I thought lawyers were smart! It was to create a scandal to make Juan lose face! That girl drove Juan into a scandal that dragged his reputation through the mud! Phoenix: (Sounds like a pretty standard definition of a scandal to me...) Why do you know about that anyway, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: I'm one of Juan's biggest fans! I'm always out there gathering information! There's nothing I don't know! Phoenix: And do you have proof that Mr. Engarde did what you say he did...? Oldbag: Next week's issue of a certain magazine says so! Phoenix: (Ugh... Of course. A tabloid...) Pearl: Next week...

And working together is the definition of teamwork. It's the power to find the truth. (Changed from [And that's the definition of teamwork.

I'm not in charge of this case, so I can be a bit more generous with information. Phoenix: (Just what is going on inside his head...?) \"Proof of Von Karma blood\" Edgeworth: A lot of things may have happened, however Manfred von Karma was still my mentor. And a \"perfect win record\" is proof of a Von Karma. Phoenix: ...One year ago, you could not establish guilt in a few cases... Are those losses the reason you suddenly disappeared from the Prosecutor's Office? Did you leave because you had lost your \"perfect win record\"...? Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: To think your motivation for prosecuting trials was so selfish... It'd been better for everyone if you never came back from the dead, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ... I see. Then let me ask you something. Why do YOU stand in the courtroom? What is your reason? Why stand in court? (appears after \"\"Proof of Von Karma blood\"\") Phoenix: Well, with Franziska, she almost always says, (Changed from [Well, if it was Franziska, she would almost definitely say,] in the original release) von Karma: \"I will defeat you this time!\" the instant she sees me.

I stand in the courtroom to defend my client. ...To save their lives. Edgeworth: To save your client, you say? Phoenix: Those who think only of their own ego-driven goals... Those kind of prosecutors are reprehensible to me. Even if you're a \"prodigy\"... Or someone like you, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ... It looks like there is still a lot you have yet to learn. Phoenix: \"A lot I have yet to learn\"? Me...? Edgeworth: ...Hmph. Well, that's enough for now. The time when you will see is coming soon enough... Missing suicide note (appears after presenting Celeste Inpax profile) Edgeworth: Ms. Inpax's death was most certainly a suicide. Of that there is no mistake. However, we could not find her suicide note. That's when the police began to suspect that someone had hidden it. Phoenix: The suicide note? But how do you know Ms. Inpax had even written such a note? Edgeworth: There was no solid evidence, however... We did find traces of ink on her right index finger. Which makes the likelihood of a suicide note very high. Phoenix: But who would hide such a thing...? Edgeworth: The police think it was Mr. Juan Corrida himself. Phoenix: Th-The victim...? Edgeworth: He was the one who found her body. Which makes him the only person who had a chance to hide her suicide note. Phoenix: (Mr. Corrida hid his own manager's suicide note...? But why...?) Edgeworth: As long as her note is missing, any speculation beyond this is meaningless... For now, I think you should look this over. This is the suicide report... Part one anyway... Phoenix: (Part one...?) Suicide Report added to the Court Record. Missing suicide note (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Ms. Inpax's death was most certainly a suicide. Of that there is no mistake.

Edgeworth: There was no solid evidence, however... We did find traces of ink on her right index finger. Which makes the likelihood of a suicide note very high. Phoenix: But who would hide such a thing...? Edgeworth: The police think it was Mr. Juan Corrida himself. Phoenix: Th-The victim...? Edgeworth: He was the one who found her body. Which makes him the only person who had a chance to hide her suicide note. Phoenix: (Mr. Corrida hid his own manager's suicide note...? But why...?) Edgeworth: As long as her note is missing, any speculation beyond this is meaningless... For now, I think you should look this over. This is the suicide report... Part one anyway... Phoenix: (Part one...?) \"Dependent nature\" (Changed from ['Co-dependency'] in the original release) (appears after presenting Suicide Report) Phoenix: What's this about Ms. Andrews having a \"dependent nature\"? (Changed from [So, how are 'Adrian Andrews' and 'co-dependency' related?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Adrian Andrews' attempt at suicide... was a few days after the death of Celeste Inpax. Phoenix: And...? Edgeworth: And why did Adrian Andrews think about committing suicide...? Because she had apparently \"lost her will to live.\" (Changed from [Quite possibly because she had 'lost her will to live.'] in the original release) Phoenix: Lost her will...? But why would she...? Edgeworth: Her pillar of strength, her mentor Celeste Inpax, was gone forever. That's why. Phoenix: Wh-Why would that...? Pearl: Is this what they call, \"following someone to the grave\"...? Edgeworth: After her attempted suicide, Adrian Andrews started attending counseling sessions. She is someone who needs a person in whom she can trust absolutely. (Changed from [She is a person who looks for someone she can trust unconditionally.] in the original release) And once she finds that person, she'll do anything she can to keep them near. (Changed from [And once she finds that someone, she blindly follows them.] in the original release) Without such an anchor in her life, her crippling anxiety stifles her ability to live.

That's according to Adrian Andrews herself. Phoenix: Then... That means her super-confident attitude... Edgeworth: It's all a fa\u00e7ade. She's only copying her mentor's behavior to hold herself together. Phoenix: (How terrible...)

She's only copying her mentor's behavior to hold herself together. Phoenix: (How terrible...) Present Suicide Report Edgeworth: I don't like to look through reports. I like suicide reports even less. Worst of all are the reports that have multiple parts like that one. That has two. Phoenix: ...Two parts? Edgeworth: What you just handed me is the first part of the report... Here is the second part. Phoenix: (The second part of the report is about an attempted suicide...) The attempter's name...! It's \"Adrian Andrews\"! Pearl: M-Ms. Andrews...? Um, what did she do? Phoenix: She... She tried to kill herself...? She doesn't seem like the kind of person to try to kill herself, though... (Changed from [She doesn't seem like the kind of person to try and kill herself...] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think she's a strong career woman? That's just what she wants you to think. (Changed from [You think she's a strong career woman? That is just her image.] in the original release) Adrian Andrews... She has a certain secret she's always trying to hide. Pearl: A secret...? Edgeworth: ...Her \"dependent nature\". That's what she's really like on the inside. (Changed from [...Her 'co-dependency'. That's the key word.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews? \"Dependent\"...? Talk about the exact opposite of what that woman is...) (Changed from ['Co-dependency'... The word most unsuited to describing that woman...] in the original release) Attempted Suicide Report Edgeworth: Appearances can be deceiving. It's such a clich\u00e9 saying... But it's clich\u00e9 because it's true. Phoenix: Ms. Andrews... (To think that behind that unwavering, brave front... She's been hiding this weakness in fear...) Juan Corrida profile Edgeworth: There is an interesting rumor about this man... Phoenix: You mean the one about Ms. Andrews getting close to him? But that's pretty common tabloid fare, isn't it? Edgeworth: I don't take things at face value when there's more to be found... Matt Engarde profile Edgeworth: While I was abroad, these deplorable types of actors became popular, I take it. Phoenix: Well, \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" is his motto... Edgeworth: \"R-Refreshing\"!? And what is so refreshing about a spring breeze!? Phoenix: (Sounds like the pollen is not treating him well this year...) Adrian Andrews profile Edgeworth: Adrian Andrews... She holds a large secret within herself. Phoenix: A secret...? Edgeworth: You can't help but feel that this whole case revolves around her... Celeste Inpax profile Edgeworth: Hmm... This woman is another key to solving this case. (Changed from [Hmm... This woman is another key to the case.] in the original release) Phoenix: D-Do you really think so? Edgeworth: She was Adrian Andrews' mentor a long time ago, but she was suddenly called away by a different show, and became Juan Corrida's manager. (Changed from [but suddenly, she was called away by a production, and became Juan Corrida's manager.] in the original release) And then, a few months later... Celeste Inpax died. Phoenix: B-But her death was ruled a suicide, right? (Changed from [B-But her death was a suicide, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Yes. But there is still one riddle we've yet to solved... [sic] (Changed from [But there is still one riddle left unsolved...] in the original release) Phoenix: A riddle...? Edgeworth: Her suicide note. It went missing. No one could find it. Phoenix: (A suicide note that just vanished, huh...) Any other evidence Edgeworth: I have no interest in talking about useless evidence. Put a little more thought into what you show me... Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (Still as stuck up as ever...) Any other profile Edgeworth: We are looking into leads, but we can only look into a few key players with our limited resources. There's no reason for us to waste our energy investigating this person.

Andrews: ... Why do you ask questions for which I have no answers? The truth is, I was not that close to Mr. Corrida. Phoenix: You were not that close...? Andrews: That's right. I've never been good at being intimate with another person. Phoenix: You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that. Present Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Leads to: \"You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: I'm very bad at connecting with people. They're so depressing for the most part. Phoenix: Um... Andrews: But I especially dislike feeble-minded individuals. Phoenix: Yes, well... Andrews: That's why I don't think I could ever be intimate with you. Phoenix: (So... I guess she's saying I'm both depressing and stupid...?) But I am certain you were very close with the victim. Andrews: Say that all you like, but you still don't have any proof. Leads to: \"You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that.\" Phoenix: You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...? Andrews: ... A silly third-rate tabloid article. If you even had half your wits about you, you wouldn't believe such rubbish. Phoenix: Well, it seems quite a few people bought into this story. Andrews: Hmph. As to be expected in a world filled with crooks and liars. Phoenix: (...Note to self: Stay on her good side.) Andrews: In any case, I despise interpersonal relationships like that. Phoenix: I see... However... What if there was a need for you to get close to someone...? Andrews: Me? Need to get close to Mr. Corrida? As if there was ever such a need.

Andrews: ...Y-You have a great imagination. You may have a future yet as a slimy muckraker for a putrid third-rate tabloid! Phoenix: M-Ms. Andrews...?

When Celeste passed away so suddenly like that... I died a death of my own. But... No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop thinking about what had become of her note.

You heard about it, and thought to recover it from him by getting close, am I right? Andrews: ... Phoenix: If that's the case, then everything changes. Andrews: Wh-What do you mean?

Andrews: You probably think I'm a worthless human being right now, don't you? Phoenix: Please, Ms. Andrews. All I want to know is the truth. Andrews: After Celeste passed away, I heard that someone had hidden her suicide note... And that someone was Juan Corrida. Celeste... Without her... Without her, I became scared. Everything... Everyone seemed like they were out to get me. Phoenix: So you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct? Andrews: ... Looks like that tabloid reported the truth after all. Ironic, isn't it? Phoenix: Well, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire. Andrews: And if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning. Pearl: ... Andrews: But as for the suicide note? I didn't and wouldn't kill anyone for it. It just doesn't suit me, that's all. Andrews: ... Well, that's enough for now. I still have work to do, so...

The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime. Judge: Oh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!? Gumshoe: Um, we thought of that too... But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: The only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's. Phoenix: Only the victim's, huh...? Judge: Hmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe: However, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What convinced you it had nothing to do with the case? Gumshoe: The guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night. Judge: Well then, where was it? Gumshoe: The bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir. Judge: So you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...? Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar. Phoenix: So that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel... Gumshoe: Yeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all. Judge: Hmm...Mia: Our first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix: But there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia: Maybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix: If you say so...Mia: Of course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:Edgeworth: I believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge: Hmm...Edgeworth: Which brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix: (Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge: Very well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe: Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other. They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book. As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button. It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\". The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife. The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge: Hmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe: It was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe: ...And there's this button.Judge: That was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe: Yes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix: What!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge: All of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth: Yes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix: Hmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth: You can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix: Grrrrrrrrr...Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not? Gumshoe: ...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown. Phoenix: But Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end... Judge: That is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing. Edgeworth: ...Gumshoe: They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls! Gumshoe: Well, yeah, I guess, but... Phoenix: Which means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all! Judge: Hmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective? Gumshoe: Um, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired. Gumshoe: Eh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's... Edgeworth: I look forward to your pension negotiations. Gumshoe: N-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO! Judge: Now, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony. Gumshoe: *sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too... Edgeworth: Detective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir! Phoenix: (Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe: As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have any proof that button belonged to the victim? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: Oh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\". Gumshoe: Huh? But can't you tell by just looking at it? Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: A-And the victim's blood is on it. Phoenix: Anyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward. Gumshoe: ... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir! Phoenix: (Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...) Edgeworth: ...Thread. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: The button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal! Phoenix: Urk. Mia: That's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe: It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press Phoenix: Phoenix: When was this button found? Gumshoe: Pretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button. Judge: Hmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder... Edgeworth: The police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people... Phoenix: (Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe: The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How were the fingerprints arranged on the knife? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: By examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...? Gumshoe: Oh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that... Phoenix: (I can't believe the bumbling of this department...) Edgeworth: ...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder. Judge: Hmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe: The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife! Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either. Phoenix: (Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...) Mia: ...Phoenix. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: There's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wait a second!\"Phoenix: (A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia: Be grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix: We're still in a world of trouble...Mia: Well, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?

So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix: Wait a second!Gumshoe: Wh-What?Phoenix: So the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe: That's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix: ...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe: H-Huh!?Phoenix: Take a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe: ...Huh?Judge: It has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe: \"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix: That's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe: ... Uh oh.Phoenix: The murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge: Yes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth: Heh heh heh...Judge: Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix: What!?Edgeworth: I think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix: H-How so!?Edgeworth: I admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe: ...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth: The question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge: Wh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth: Sorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge: There is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth: If it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix: Urk...Edgeworth: Mr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge: Amazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia: It seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix: (This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge: A murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth: I can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix: (Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia: He means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge: What does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Um, well...Mia: Phoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix: (That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge: Mr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do. Leads to: \"There's one...\"No, not right now. Phoenix: (This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.) Judge: Looks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one. Edgeworth: Which means this court is adjourned. Mia: Phoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick! Phoenix: (Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!) Phoenix: Leads to: \"There's one...\"Phoenix: There's one...Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: One piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge: Mr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth: What the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix: (If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge: You may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass Phoenix: Leads to: \"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong. Judge: I can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence. Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: I am a man of my word, Mr. Wright! Infinite penaltyJudge: This... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix: Please look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge: Hmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix: However! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge: ...Gumshoe: ...Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: W-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge: Ah, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix: Y-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge: You can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: What is it, Your Honor?Judge: Your opinion...Edgeworth: ...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix: ...What!?Edgeworth: It's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge: Hmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible. Phoenix: (It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...) Mia: You can't think like that, Phoenix. Phoenix: Mia... Mia: Right now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing! Phoenix: (So in other words, push as far as we can go...) Leads to: \"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way. Phoenix: (If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!) Mia: They just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough! Leads to: \"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix: The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge: Hmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix: (There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth: Unlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix: Wh-What!?Edgeworth: You're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix: Th-Then...Edgeworth: Of course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix: Fingerprints...Edgeworth: There were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge: Only one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth: They were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix: WHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth: That is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth: Ms. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge: Hmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth: Tsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix: Grrr!Edgeworth: I've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge: W-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix: \"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth: Yes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia: What in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth: Now then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag: ...Edgeworth: ... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth: Uurrngh!Oldbag: ...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth: Grrrrrrrrr...Phoenix: (I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag: Oh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth: I saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag: I tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge: Ms... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge: Oof!Oldbag: Shush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge: Yes, madam.Edgeworth: No no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag: It's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth: The witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag: It was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge: You mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag: Look, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix: (Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag: Anyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth: Very well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag: Leave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag: Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room. There was something I was interested in finding out, you know... Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time. That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room. It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge: Hmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag: See! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth: ...Judge: I see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag: Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag, what was your post on that night? Oldbag: The lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails. Phoenix: (Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...) Oldbag: Besides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little. Phoenix: And that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag: There was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Something you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that? Oldbag: It's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...? Edgeworth: I have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor. Phoenix: (\"Gossip\"...?) Edgeworth: If this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony. Mia: It looks like we shouldn't force it right now. Judge: Hmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag: Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Oh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room? Oldbag: I have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am! Judge: ...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report. Edgeworth: In any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag: That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who in the world was that!? Oldbag: I'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was... Judge: Yes...? He was...? Oldbag: ... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud! Phoenix: (Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...) Oldbag: Well, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag: It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!? Oldbag: Yessey! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Annoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person! Phoenix: (Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release)) The person's face Phoenix: Please tell the court about the man's face in more detail! Oldbag: You don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth! Phoenix: His teeth were... shining? Oldbag: Well, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie. Phoenix: ... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night! Oldbag: What? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!? Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all. Judge: *sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn. Oldbag: You've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me! Phoenix: (And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...) Leads back to cross-examination It was very important. Phoenix: Of course it was important, Your Honor! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important! Phoenix: You don't really have to put it that way to get me to say... Judge: Mr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...) Leads back to cross-examination What the person was carrying Phoenix: What was the man you saw carrying? Oldbag: In which hand? His right or his left? Phoenix: Um... Oldbag: Ah, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question! Judge: Indeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: S-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand? Oldbag: Ah, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand. Phoenix: Then how about his left? Oldbag: Empty. Phoenix: ... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...) Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all. Judge: *sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn. Oldbag: You've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me! Phoenix: (And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...) Leads back to cross-examination It was very important. Phoenix: Of course it was important, Your Honor! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important! Phoenix: You don't really have to put it that way to get me to say... Judge: Mr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...) Leads back to cross-examination The person's clothes Phoenix: Please tell the court about the man's clothes in more detail! Oldbag: What a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters. Phoenix: But it does. Oldbag: Um... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing. Phoenix: What thing? Oldbag: That gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket. Phoenix: (Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...) Oldbag: That thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!! Phoenix: Um, right... Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all. Judge: *sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn. Oldbag: You've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!

Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important! Phoenix: Don't you see it, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Your Honor! I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony. Judge: Hmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please... Oldbag: Ah well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must... Adds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"Press (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!? Oldbag: Yessey! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Annoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person! Phoenix: (Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)Oldbag: He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket? Oldbag: What do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it! Phoenix: (She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)Present Jammin' Ninja's Button Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Oldbag...\"Mia: She may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.Phoenix: That's bad for us. Really bad.Mia: But, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix: (That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag: Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag, what was your post on that night? Oldbag: The lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails. Phoenix: (Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...) Oldbag: Besides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little. Phoenix: And that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag: There was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Something you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that? Oldbag: It's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...? Edgeworth: I have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor. Phoenix: (\"Gossip\"...?) Edgeworth: If this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony. Mia: It looks like we shouldn't force it right now. Judge: Hmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag: Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Oh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room? Oldbag: I have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am! Judge: ...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report. Edgeworth: In any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag: That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who in the world was that!? Oldbag: I'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was... Judge: Yes...? He was...? Oldbag: ... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud! Phoenix: (Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...) Oldbag: Well, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag: It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!? Oldbag: Yessey! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Annoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person! Phoenix: (Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release)) The person's face Phoenix: Please tell the court about the man's face in more detail! Oldbag: You don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth! Phoenix: His teeth were... shining? Oldbag: Well, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie. Phoenix: ... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night! Oldbag: What? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?

Phoenix: Um... Oldbag: Ah, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question! Judge: Indeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: S-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand? Oldbag: Ah, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand. Phoenix: Then how about his left? Oldbag: Empty. Phoenix: ...

She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag: See! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix: It was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag: See! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix: ...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag: ... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge: Now hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag: But when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag: Edgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth: Well, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix: Just say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge: Witness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!Oldbag: *sigh* Alright, if you insist.Phoenix: (I should be the one sighing, not you!)Witness Testimony-- Who I Saw --Oldbag: Engarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember! The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw! Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder. He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know. So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Phoenix: I... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!Oldbag: What? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix: But... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag: Ah, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge: H-How do you know that?Oldbag: Because... I said so. And what I say is the truth.Phoenix: (At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)Judge: Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Who I Saw --Oldbag: Engarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Would you please get on with your testimony! Oldbag: Hmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs! Phoenix: Uh, what? Oldbag: \"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\" Phoenix: (...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!? Edgeworth: Witness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts. Oldbag: OKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!? Edgeworth: Wright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date. Phoenix: (Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)Oldbag: The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Be a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!? Oldbag: \"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream? Phoenix: ...Huh? Oldbag: What did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!? Phoenix: My dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!? Oldbag: See! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!? Phoenix: Well... Oldbag: \"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"! Phoenix: (Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?) Oldbag: All that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?Oldbag: Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why would that be? Oldbag: That way, no one could see his face, of course! Phoenix: But there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more! Oldbag: ... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say... Phoenix: (Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?) Oldbag: I got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag: He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show? Oldbag: Well, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing. Phoenix: And that included the Jammin' Ninja...? Oldbag: Of course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought. Judge: Hmm... I see. Oldbag: Well, anyway.Oldbag: So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai? Oldbag: As showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!? Phoenix: (Can I throw in the towel yet?)Present Knife Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please take a look at this.\"Phoenix: Hmm...Mia: You don't need to think too hard on this one.Phoenix: Huh?Mia: There's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...Phoenix: (Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)-- Secret Information --Oldbag: That Engarde is one evil, evil man!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You can't say something like that without proof! That's just slander! Oldbag: But it's true! That woman was getting intimate with poor Juan! Look! It says so right here, doesn't it!? \"Manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\" Phoenix: But the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"... Oldbag: What? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth! Phoenix: Um... Oldbag: Honestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip! Judge: Yes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?) Oldbag: Anyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touch\u00e9\"!Oldbag: He thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A scandal...? What do you mean by that? Oldbag: You're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...? Phoenix: Ah, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much! Oldbag: Well! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!Oldbag: So to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing! Oldbag: You must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth. And now, since you're in so much shock, you can't do anything right! Phoenix: (You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.) Oldbag: Alright then, sonny, show me what you've got! Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!? Present evidence Phoenix: I'm not going to let you push me around that easily! Oldbag: Heh. There's many a man who've said those exact words and paid dearly for them. Phoenix: Maybe you should brace yourself this time! Here is my proof that Mr. Engarde did not hold any ill-will towards the victim! Present anything Phoenix: Oldbag: ...Is that it? You can take it from here, Edgey-poo! Edgeworth: Ngrk! Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!? (Changed from [EH!? Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!?] in the original release) Oldbag: I want you to give that jagged-headed baboon-boy a message for me! Please? Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing. Edgeworth: Um... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy! Judge: Yes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy. Phoenix: (Did I just gain a new nickname here...?) Leads to: \"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\" Decline the offer to present Phoenix: ...I don't have anything to offer. Oldbag: Seeeeeee! Just as I thought. Leads to: \"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\" Oldbag: And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof! You've just given me a free pass to say whatever I want whenever I want, silly boy! Phoenix: (Me and my big mouth...) Oldbag: That's the way the cookie crumbles. For you, anyway.Oldbag: I cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...? Oldbag: Like I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need! Judge: You were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...? Oldbag: I was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this! Judge: N-No, stop! Oldbag: Well, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.Oldbag: ...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait! Oldbag: What!? I'm a busy woman! Tea time with the kids is over! Phoenix: Secret information that no one else knows yet... If that's true, then how do you know this \"secret information\"!? Oldbag: Huh!? Well... That's... because I'm a pro... Yes, that's it... Phoenix: ... Oldbag: I-It's a secret! Even if you drill a hole into my brain, you'll never find out! Phoenix: (How in the world did that old bat get such a \"secret\" piece of information...?) Press further Phoenix: If you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today! Oldbag: Umm... Edgey-boy! What are you doing!? Help me! Edgeworth: Eh!? What do I have to do with this!? Oldbag: Just do this for me... You'll get your reward. Edgeworth: Hmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head! Phoenix: (And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?) Judge: As long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning. Phoenix: (Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!) Leads back to cross-examination Present evidence Phoenix: So no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...? Oldbag: Wh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that! Phoenix: Witness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release) Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"! Judge: Objection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue. Oldbag: Okie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down! Phoenix: (Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...) Leads back to cross-examination Wait and see Phoenix: (I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...) Leads back to cross-examinationMia: Sounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.Phoenix: (Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)Mia: There has to be something we can catch her on...Phoenix: (Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)Phoenix: The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...Judge: Oh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.Phoenix: She reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.Judge: She reported such a thing...?Phoenix: On that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.Oldbag: Wh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?Phoenix: No no no, I said impressions.Oldbag: Then... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?Phoenix: Ah! That's it! That's the note!Oldbag: Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!Judge: Hmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?Oldbag: I'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!Phoenix: ...Judge: ...Edgeworth: ...Oldbag: ... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?Edgeworth: Nngh...Oldbag: I was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!Edgeworth: You really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.Judge: Well, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.Phoenix: (She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)Pile on more pressure. Phoenix: (If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!) Leads to: \"Witness!\"Forgive her. Phoenix: I guess we should forgive her. Oldbag: Hmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent! Phoenix: Grr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.) Mia: Phoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Mia: You should be pressing her until she gives in! Phoenix: (Mia is really scary today... *gulp*) Leads to: \"Witness!\"Phoenix: Witness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?Oldbag: S-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!Phoenix: You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!Oldbag: Are you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Oldbag!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Hmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling? Phoenix: Um... Judge: I'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections! Phoenix: (Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!) Leads back to: \"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?Judge: A camera...?Phoenix: Yesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"Judge: Why... Why... Witness!!Oldbag: What is it, gramps?Phoenix: If you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!Oldbag: Grr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?Phoenix: Ah, that's...!Oldbag: What!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!Judge: Um... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...Oldbag: I saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!Judge: Bailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?Edgeworth: There is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.Judge: Please present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!Oldbag: See, I told you! That's the guy I saw!Judge: This proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.Judge: Wh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth: This photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge: If that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth: The defendant.Judge: How did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix: (If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it. Phoenix: There is nothing strange with this photo. Edgeworth: Hmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright. Judge: I see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial. Mia: Is this really alright with you, Phoenix!? Phoenix: W-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi-- Mia: Try again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor! Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards. Phoenix: Um, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait... Edgeworth: Oh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo? Judge: Wh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!? Leads to: \"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it. Leads to: \"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix: There's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth: I knew this was coming, Wright.Judge: Your thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: I think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge: \"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: ... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge: If you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix: Um... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)Judge: Now then, let's hear your objection.

Edgeworth: I think it's about time you retired! Judge: Hmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all. Edgeworth: The problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor. Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: You are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright!

What does that mean...?Phoenix: The costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)Judge: What is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.Phoenix: Let's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge: His... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix: Exactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: There is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia: That's curious...Phoenix: Huh? What is?Mia: Edgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix: That's true...Mia: He's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix: \"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia: I can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix: (He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth: ...Judge: If the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix: WHAT!?Edgeworth: Wright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix: (Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia: Don't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix: (Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge: Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?Present Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Are you saying this is who you think was in the costume...? Phoenix: Uh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see? Mia: I can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places... Phoenix: (Argh... And I really thought I had it!) Judge: Now then, would you care to try one more time? Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"Judge: A-Adrian Andrews...?Phoenix: If you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!Edgeworth: And why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix: For starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge: And how does that all add up?Phoenix: It means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge: The knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth: Why don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix: (I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!Judge: Order! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor?Judge: This court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: (Alright! This is it...)Mia: This... is kind of bad for us.Phoenix: Huh? What do you mean?Mia: If Adrian Andrews is summoned to court as a witness... It means that the trial will go on for another day.Phoenix: One more day...? Ack!!

I request that you please continue with today's trial.Judge: B-But... We cannot continue due to this unexpected development!Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk. \"Unexpected\" development? I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.Judge: And what do you mean by that...?Edgeworth: That Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan... Even if Wright was a bit slow to catch on...Phoenix: Wh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge: What is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth: Ms. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.Phoenix: ...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)Mia: Somehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.Edgeworth: Exactly.Judge: Very well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess.

I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix: She is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde: So after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix: See, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde: Hmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix: Yes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde: But... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix: She has her own agenda.Engarde: H-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix: I'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde: Get me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia: Phoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix: ...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia: ...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix: And that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia: That sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix: Um, what...?Mia: Who was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...?

Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth: The prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court.

Now then...Andrews: Before we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge: Uh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews: I'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge: Ah, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix: (If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth: Anyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews: Yes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge: Hmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews: But I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth: No one has accused you of that.Andrews: I think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix: ...!Judge: I think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth: Very well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews: It was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room. After that, I went to Juan's room. And there was his dead body. I... I was in shock... What I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo. I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.Judge: You poured yourself a glass of juice...?Andrews: Yes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth: And that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge: I see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia: Phoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix: Yes... I know.Mia: In order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix: Disrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia: She's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it.

Understand?Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews: It was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...?

I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch.

When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct? Andrews: And what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time. Phoenix: Your mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you. Andrews: Aren't you rude today?

It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the inside, not the outside!Judge: Th-That's very true!Phoenix: Furthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.Judge: And wh-what is that?Phoenix: Let's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.Judge: And what is wrong with that?Phoenix: If the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!Andrews: Ah!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: What is your point, Wright!? That the case was closed at the time the vase was knocked over? Is that all!?Phoenix:Phoenix: No. Think back to what Ms. Andrews testified to! She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!Edgeworth: Nngh...Judge: Yes, that's right...

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given scenario. The testimonies are from Adrian Andrews regarding the guitar case.\n\nFirst, the testimonies are:\n0. I don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\n1. I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\n2. It's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\n3. As for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.\n\nThe relevant evidence here is the Guitar Case (evidence 7), which states that the guitar case had only the victim's fingerprints. Andrews claims she opened the case, but if she was wearing gloves, her fingerprints wouldn't be there. However, the key contradiction might be elsewhere.\n\nLooking at testimony 1 where she says she opened the guitar case after knocking over the vase. However, the crime photo (evidence 9) shows the guitar case was open with the vase's remains outside. If she opened it after the vase fell, the glass shards would be inside the case, but they're outside. This contradicts her statement that she opened the case after the vase fell. Therefore, evidence 7 (Guitar Case) showing the case's condition contradicts testimony 1.\n\nWait, but the exact contradiction might be between her opening the case after the vase fell (testimony 1) and the physical evidence showing the vase's shards outside the case. The Guitar Case evidence mentions the case was found open, but the water was on the outside. If she opened it after the vase fell, the vase was already broken, so the shards would have fallen onto a closed case. But the vase was on top of the dresser, and when it fell, if the case was closed, the shards would be on the closed lid. Later, if she opened the case, the shards would still be on the lid, not inside. Hmm, maybe the water on the case's lid (from the vase) would have gotten inside if the case was opened after the vase fell. But the Guitar Case evidence says the water was only on the top of the lid, not inside. So if the case was open when the vase fell, water would have gone inside. But since the water is only on the lid, the case must have been closed when the vase fell. Therefore, Andrews couldn't have opened the case after the vase fell because that would mean the vase fell onto an open case, leading water inside. Since the water is only on the lid, the case was closed when the vase fell. So her testimony about opening the case after the vase fell contradicts the physical evidence of the water's location. Therefore, testimony 1 (opening the case after knocking the vase) contradicts evidence 7 (water on the lid, not inside), meaning she must have opened the case before the vase fell, which she didn't mention. But how does that tie into her testimony?\n\nWait, Andrews claims she knocked over the vase, which fell onto the guitar case. Then she opened the case. But if the case was closed when the vase fell, the water would be on the lid. Then when she opened it, the water would have spilled inside. However, the Guitar Case evidence states there's water only on the top of the lid, not inside. Therefore, the case must have been open when the vase fell, causing water to go inside. But since the water is only on the lid, the case must have been closed when the vase fell, meaning she couldn't have opened it after. Thus, her testimony about opening the case after the vase fell is impossible. Therefore, the contradiction is between testimony 1 and the Guitar Case (evidence 7)."

Pearl: When did you lose your camera? Lotta: Last night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie! Phoenix: Lotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours? Lotta: I don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop. Phoenix: (I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?) What happened Phoenix: Lotta, please tell me what you know about what happened at the time of the murder. Lotta: Well, from before the ceremony last night, I was hangin' around here in this area. Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested. Phoenix: What were you doing here...? Lotta: You sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had! Phoenix: A big scoop...? Lotta: I told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot! Phoenix: (I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?) Lotta: Although, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time... Big scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\") Phoenix: Lotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop? Lotta: Well... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof? Phoenix: What kind of story was it that you would hang around here...? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Lotta: Oops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know? Phoenix: (Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?) Pearl: We've been stopped, haven't we? Lotta: Ha ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer! Phoenix: (I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...) Big scoop (subsequent times) Phoenix: You were on the hunt for your big scoop last night? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Lotta: It's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder. Pearl: It looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks. Phoenix: Yeah... I guess so. Present Press Conference Ticket Lotta: Hey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!? Phoenix: P-Please don't direct your anger at me... Lotta: Why in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!? Phoenix: (...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?) Pearl: Are you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!? Lotta's Camera Lotta: Nngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal! Phoenix: Please don't look straight at me while you're saying that... Lotta: When I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet! Phoenix: (And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...) Maya Fey profile Lotta: Now that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...? Pearl: Um... Lotta: She's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now... Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk...) Pearl: ... Pearl Fey profile Lotta: Ah, just wanna say sorry to ya. Pearl: For...? Lotta: Well, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer. Pearl: ...Huh? Lotta: You know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey... Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What!? But why!? Lotta: I mean, you were all worked up, ya know? Pearl: *sniffle* ...Meanie... Phoenix: Lotta, that was very insensitive of you! Lotta Hart profile Lotta: This kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot! Pearl: Wow, that's really lucky! Phoenix: (*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...) Juan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile Lotta: I don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot. Pearl: Oh, I see... Lotta: And shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me... Pearl: O-Oh... Lotta: Sounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this! Phoenix: W-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that! Security Lady profile Lotta: This old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know... Phoenix: (A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.) Anything else Phoenix: Um... Do you know anything... Lotta: ...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there! Pearl: Please don't get so worked up over this... Lotta: Hah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters. March 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room Pearl: Um... Where are we? Phoenix: We're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room. ???: May I help you with something? Phoenix: Um, uh... We're... ???: You're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail. Phoenix: Um... How did you know I'm his lawyer...? ???: You were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer. Pearl: Wow... ???: It's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct? Phoenix: Well, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either. Pearl: It's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick. Andrews: I am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business. Phoenix: A-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...) Examine Red suitcase Phoenix: It's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here. Pearl: Stars really are different from us, aren't they...? Bedroom Phoenix: That's the bedroom over there. Pearl: That's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here! Sofa Phoenix: There's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here. Pearl: Um, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\". Phoenix: (Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...) Table Phoenix: Looks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that. Pearl: I'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates. Phoenix: Looks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...? Plate on right Phoenix: There's a giant bone sitting on the plate. Pearl: I... I don't really like meat... Phoenix: (...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...) Talk Night of the murder Andrews: I assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct? Phoenix: Y-Yes, that is correct. Andrews: Then I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add. Phoenix: \"Dinner\"? What did you eat? Andrews: I told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me. Phoenix: (...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...) Andrews: When the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall. Phoenix: And after the show ended, you came back to this room...? Andrews: No, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby. Phoenix: Oh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...) Andrews: When it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida... Phoenix: And that's when you found his body, isn't it? Andrews: ... Pearl: You really held strong through everything... Phoenix: (Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...) Relation to Engarde Phoenix: Um, so... About you and... Andrews: Stop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release) Phoenix: S-Sorry... Andrews: I have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Why did she have to go and say something like that...?) Pearl: Mr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright? Andrews: I already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager. Phoenix: His manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one? Andrews: No, he did not. Phoenix: He didn't? Andrews: Global Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars. Phoenix: I see... Andrews: This industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly. Pearl: You're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...! Phoenix: Pearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright? Pearl: Nngh... Motive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile) Phoenix: Do you have any ideas? Andrews: As to...? Phoenix: As to why Mr. Corrida was murdered? Andrews: Why would you ask me about such a thing...? Phoenix: I'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: M-Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: Sorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation. Pearl: Is it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately. Motive for murder (subsequent times) Phoenix: You know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered... 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Andrews: Why are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart. Phoenix: (No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.) Pearl: If you don't remove her locks... Phoenix: (Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...) Present Press Conference Ticket Phoenix: You were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right? Andrews: Yes, that's right. Pearl: But Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it. Andrews: ... Is that what he said...? Pearl: Huh...? Andrews: Actually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked. Pearl: Oh... I see. Phoenix: (I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.) Will Powers profile Andrews: That's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be. Phoenix: (Urk... What a horrible thing to say...) Andrews: ...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...) Pearl: I wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews... Juan Corrida profile Phoenix: Did you know the victim, Mr. Corrida? Andrews: Yes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all. Pearl: Did you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai? Andrews: Honestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release) Phoenix: ! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!) Matt Engarde profile Andrews: I asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition. Phoenix: (Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...) Pearl: He's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick? Andrews: ... Adrian Andrews profile Andrews: I hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why. Phoenix: S-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...) Anything else Phoenix: Um, I'd like to ask you about this... Andrews: I told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me. Phoenix: (Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...) March 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room Pearl: Mr. Nick... Where are we...? Phoenix: We're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls. Pearl: Mr. Corrida...? Phoenix: The victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too. Gumshoe: Oh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!? Phoenix: Not yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal. Gumshoe: Umm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there? Phoenix: (I just want Maya to be alright...) Pearl: ... Gumshoe: We don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal. Phoenix: Can you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...? Gumshoe: Just this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here. Phoenix: Thank you. Gumshoe: Oh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy. Pearl: Wow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you! Gumshoe: Ha ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good. Pearl: Mr. Nick! I got a map! Phoenix: That's great, Pearls! Pearl: ... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says... Hotel Guidemap added to the Court Record. Examine Refrigerator Phoenix: There are all sorts of things in this refrigerator... Pearl: The carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty... Phoenix: Empty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut. Pearl: ...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too! Phoenix: Maybe red was his favorite color...? Stuffed bears Pearl: Wow, there are a lot of bears! Phoenix: (Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?) Pearl: There's even a few in the trash can... Phoenix: Yeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears. Pearl: Poor teddies... It's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Phoenix: ... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...) Pearl: What's wrong, Mr. Nick? Desk Pearl: Hmph! It's so messy here! Phoenix: (Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...) Pearl: There are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please? Phoenix: OK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist. Pearl: ... I know what a watch is... Phoenix: (Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...) Blue suitcase Phoenix: It's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator... Pearl: Do all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida? Table on right Phoenix: It looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night. Pearl: This bottle... It's tomato juice. Phoenix: (We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...) Bedroom Pearl: So that's a bed, right? Phoenix: Yup. It's big, but it's a bed. Pearl: Aaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft! Phoenix: (Big beds must be a rarity for her...) Scattered items near guitar case Phoenix: Bottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant. Pearl: What's this glass fragment from...? Phoenix: A flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are. Pearl: You don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick? Guitar case Phoenix: This is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable. Pearl: That's strange. The guitar is not here... Phoenix: Maybe he forgot to bring it to the show? Pearl: But Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item... Phoenix: (That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid... Pearl: Yeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...? Guitar Case added to the Court Record. Guitar case (subsequent times) Phoenix: This is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable. Pearl: That's strange. The guitar is not here... Phoenix: Maybe he forgot to bring it to the show? Pearl: But Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item... Phoenix: (That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid... Pearl: Yeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...? Wine glass Phoenix: It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it. Pearl: Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much. Phoenix: There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from. Pearl: But doesn't it seem weird? Phoenix: ...What seems weird? Pearl: I mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor. Phoenix: ... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.) Pearl: Why is this glass the only thing that's still alright...? Wine Glass added to the Court Record. Wine glass (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it. Pearl: Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much. Phoenix: There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from. Pearl: But doesn't it seem weird? Phoenix: ...What seems weird? Pearl: I mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor. Phoenix: ... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.) Pearl: Why is this glass the only thing that's still alright...? Talk Cause of death Phoenix: Do you know what was the cause of death? Gumshoe: Well, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release) Phoenix: It should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah. Here's a picture. Phoenix: There's a knife in his chest. Gumshoe: Yeah, pal, that's the murder weapon. Phoenix: (So he was stabbed to death...) Gumshoe: They're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now. Phoenix: There were fingerprints on the knife? Gumshoe: Yup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal. Phoenix: (That's bad... Real bad...) Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Cause of death (subsequent times) Phoenix: Do you know what was the cause of death? Gumshoe: Well, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release) Phoenix: It should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah. Here's a picture. Phoenix: There's a knife in his chest. Gumshoe: Yeah, pal, that's the murder weapon. Phoenix: (So he was stabbed to death...) Gumshoe: They're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now. Phoenix: There were fingerprints on the knife? Gumshoe: Yup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal. Phoenix: (That's bad... Real bad...) Reason for arrest Phoenix: Why was Mr. Engarde arrested? Gumshoe: Because we had evidence on him. Pearl: Evidence...? Gumshoe: It looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight. Phoenix: Yeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere. Gumshoe: Well, yeah. During the fight, his button came off... Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...) Gumshoe: But that's not all... Phoenix: What!? Gumshoe: There was a witness, pal. Phoenix: A witness!? Wh-Who is it!? Gumshoe: That lady... Ms. Oldbag. Phoenix: (Please... Anyone but her!) Gumshoe: The prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release) Phoenix: Something that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: As in, that's for you to figure out, pal! Pearl: Alright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick! Present Radio Transceiver Gumshoe: That's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that... Pearl: Yeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is! Phoenix: (It uses radio waves, huh?) Gumshoe: I got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal! Guitar Case Phoenix: What can you tell me about this guitar case? Gumshoe: Oh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item. Phoenix: The guitar case? Gumshoe: No, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course! Pearl: But... The guitar is missing. Gumshoe: Yeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show. Phoenix: (It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...) Wine Glass Phoenix: So about this wine glass... Gumshoe: Ah, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched. Phoenix: You noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...? Gumshoe: No, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first. Phoenix: Yeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release) Phoenix: You can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash. Crime Photo Gumshoe: You look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\" Phoenix: (Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: I'm sorry. Phoenix: ...For what? Gumshoe: I really want to help you look for her, pal. Pearl: Mr. Detective... Gumshoe: If anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can! Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey, little missy. Listen good, OK? Pearl: OK. What is it? Gumshoe: Don't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it. Pearl: Huh!? Gumshoe: If you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK? Phoenix: (Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...) Lotta Hart profile Gumshoe: If I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see. Phoenix: ...Because I'm in the number one spot? Gumshoe: Don't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Really? Then who's in first...? Gumshoe: Ms. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race. Phoenix: O-Oh... Gumshoe: She's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't... Phoenix: (He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...) Matt Engarde profile Gumshoe: Hey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so. Phoenix: One dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money? Gumshoe: I... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's... Phoenix: (It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!) Pearl: Mr. Nick... Security Lady profile Gumshoe: I thought she was an alien from outer space. Phoenix: Yeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet. Gumshoe: Nah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal. Phoenix: ... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean... Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: She's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\". Phoenix: Yeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together. Gumshoe: Compared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up. Phoenix: (I feel sort of bad for him...) Anything else Phoenix: What do you know about this? Gumshoe: Um... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast... After clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass: ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... Pearl: Wh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: (Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...) Gumshoe: It's Ms. von Karma... Pearl: Huh? Gumshoe: For some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release) Gumshoe: S-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww! von Karma: At last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?) von Karma: So you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you! Phoenix: (Owww!) von Karma: Hey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat! Gumshoe: Ah! von Karma: I didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful... Gumshoe: Uwaah! von Karma: Detective! Come over here for a second! Gumshoe: Yeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow! von Karma: ...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment. Phoenix: (He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...) von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine! Phoenix: ... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...? von Karma: Wh-What...!? Phoenix: ... von Karma: ... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! von Karma: This isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor! Phoenix: (Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?) Gumshoe: ...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you... Examine Paper on desk Pearl: Mr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...? Phoenix: It's called an \"autograph\". Pearl: Auto-graff? Phoenix: It's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph. Pearl: I can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this. Phoenix: Ah, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here? Pearl: Th-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone! Phoenix: (Hold on...) Pearl: ...? Phoenix: Wendy... I've heard that name somewhere before... Mr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record. After visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room: March 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall Powers: Oh, Mr. Wright! How are you? Phoenix: Ah, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time? Powers: Yeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave... Talk The Nickel Samurai Phoenix: Can you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show? Powers: OK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\". Phoenix: I see... Powers: This time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo! Phoenix: I see... ... W-Wait... A love what...? Powers: A love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time. Phoenix: Oh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl? Powers: Anyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader! Phoenix: Sounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three. Powers: Y-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies. Pearl: Um... Powers: Yes, Pearl? Pearl: Wh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she? Powers: Every Sunday at 8 AM. Pearl: I'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week! Phoenix: (I can't believe she's really considering it!) Jammin' Ninja Phoenix: So what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like? Powers: It started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star. Phoenix: ...Uh, what? Powers: He was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm. Phoenix: A... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!? Powers: And then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3! Phoenix: Aww, that's too bad for him... Powers: Y-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like. Pearl: Um... Powers: Yes, Pearl? Pearl: Wh-What happens next!? I want to know! Pearl: Jammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!? Powers: Every Sunday at 8 AM. Pearl: Umm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...

Powers: Ah, so you ARE interested in it! I figured you would be! (Changed from [Ah, so you're interested in it too! I figured you would be!] in the original release) Phoenix: Yeah. Powers: I have such a weakness for celebrity gossip, too. Phoenix: O-Oh really... You too, huh...? Powers: Yeah. So take a look at this! Phoenix: (Looks like a tabloid Ms. Oldbag would read...)

And I didn't suspect a thing because he looked like such a normal old man... Phoenix: (Old man, huh...) Guitar Case Powers: That guitar case... That was Juan's... Phoenix: I'm guessing you've seen this case before? Powers: It's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar. Phoenix: (The bright red guitar... The Jammin' Ninja's signature item.) Pearl: But if the guitar is so important, how could he forget it for the award ceremony? Phoenix: (That does seem a little strange...) Maya Fey profile Powers: I... I'm sure he won't hurt her and he'll let her go soon... Phoenix: Yeah... Powers: Mr. Wright. I believe in you. You will save her! Phoenix: Thanks.

Powers: There's sort of a small rumor going around about her right now... Pearl: A rumor...? Powers: Ah! If you're interested, I can give you a little bit of the details! Phoenix: (He's so happy, he looks like a lion that's just found his next meal...) Detention Center Present Magazine Clipping Phoenix: What do you think about this article...? Engarde: ... Hmph. If you're talking about her thing with Juan, I always thought she was a bit careless in the way she handled it... ... Phoenix: And that's it? Engarde: ...That's it. Adrian Andrews profile Engarde: That's my manager. Did you meet her? Phoenix: Uh, yeah. Engarde: What do you think? Strong woman, right? And she takes good care of me...

Oldbag: I tell you, I saw him that night. I saw him coming out of Juan's room. Phoenix: You're kidding! Pearl: Oh no! Oldbag: It was about ten minutes before Juan's body was discovered. It was just a coincidence. I was on my way to the toilet, minding my own business. Phoenix: And...? Did you tell that to the police? Oldbag: Well, of course! I thought I could get a gift certificate or two out of it, maybe more. Pearl: Gift certificate...? Oldbag: I've been recruited again for that part at the trial. You know, the trial tomorrow? This time, you're gonna get it! I'm gonna work hard to get your client pronounced guilty! Pearl: But Mr. Engarde hasn't done anything bad... Oldbag: I don't care about details like that! I know he did my dear poor Juan in! I just do! That yellow-bellied chicken! Pearl: A yellow-bellied chicken...? I wonder what that would look like... Oldbag: I trust my senses. I know when someone did something bad, and I say he did it! Phoenix: (What did Mr. Engarde ever do to her to deserve this...?)

That guy, he shoved the girl onto Juan on purpose! Phoenix: His own manager? But why...? Oldbag: I thought lawyers were smart! It was to create a scandal to make Juan lose face! That girl drove Juan into a scandal that dragged his reputation through the mud! Phoenix: (Sounds like a pretty standard definition of a scandal to me...) Why do you know about that anyway, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: I'm one of Juan's biggest fans! I'm always out there gathering information! There's nothing I don't know! Phoenix: And do you have proof that Mr. Engarde did what you say he did...? Oldbag: Next week's issue of a certain magazine says so! Phoenix: (Ugh... Of course. A tabloid...) Pearl: Next week...

I'm not in charge of this case, so I can be a bit more generous with information. Phoenix: (Just what is going on inside his head...?) \"Proof of Von Karma blood\" Edgeworth: A lot of things may have happened, however Manfred von Karma was still my mentor. And a \"perfect win record\" is proof of a Von Karma. Phoenix: ...One year ago, you could not establish guilt in a few cases...

Phoenix: To think your motivation for prosecuting trials was so selfish... It'd been better for everyone if you never came back from the dead, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ... I see. Then let me ask you something. Why do YOU stand in the courtroom? What is your reason? Why stand in court? (appears after \"\"Proof of Von Karma blood\"\") Phoenix: Well, with Franziska, she almost always says, (Changed from [Well, if it was Franziska, she would almost definitely say,] in the original release) von Karma: \"I will defeat you this time!\" the instant she sees me. (Changed from ['I will defeat you this time!' the instant she saw me.] in the original release) Phoenix: But... The courtroom is not a personal battlefield for prosecutors and lawyers. I stand in the courtroom to defend my client. ...To save their lives. Edgeworth: To save your client, you say? Phoenix: Those who think only of their own ego-driven goals... Those kind of prosecutors are reprehensible to me. Even if you're a \"prodigy\"... Or someone like you, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ... It looks like there is still a lot you have yet to learn. Phoenix: \"A lot I have yet to learn\"? Me...? Edgeworth: ...Hmph. Well, that's enough for now. The time when you will see is coming soon enough... Missing suicide note (appears after presenting Celeste Inpax profile) Edgeworth: Ms. Inpax's death was most certainly a suicide. Of that there is no mistake. However, we could not find her suicide note. That's when the police began to suspect that someone had hidden it. Phoenix: The suicide note? But how do you know Ms. Inpax had even written such a note? Edgeworth: There was no solid evidence, however... We did find traces of ink on her right index finger. Which makes the likelihood of a suicide note very high. Phoenix: But who would hide such a thing...? Edgeworth: The police think it was Mr. Juan Corrida himself. Phoenix: Th-The victim...? Edgeworth: He was the one who found her body. Which makes him the only person who had a chance to hide her suicide note. Phoenix: (Mr. Corrida hid his own manager's suicide note...? But why...?) Edgeworth: As long as her note is missing, any speculation beyond this is meaningless... For now, I think you should look this over. This is the suicide report... Part one anyway... Phoenix: (Part one...?) Suicide Report added to the Court Record. Missing suicide note (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Ms. Inpax's death was most certainly a suicide. Of that there is no mistake.

(Changed from [So, how are 'Adrian Andrews' and 'co-dependency' related?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Adrian Andrews' attempt at suicide... was a few days after the death of Celeste Inpax. Phoenix: And...? Edgeworth: And why did Adrian Andrews think about committing suicide...? Because she had apparently \"lost her will to live.\" (Changed from [Quite possibly because she had 'lost her will to live.'] in the original release) Phoenix: Lost her will...? But why would she...? Edgeworth: Her pillar of strength, her mentor Celeste Inpax, was gone forever. That's why. Phoenix: Wh-Why would that...? Pearl: Is this what they call, \"following someone to the grave\"...? Edgeworth: After her attempted suicide, Adrian Andrews started attending counseling sessions. She is someone who needs a person in whom she can trust absolutely. (Changed from [She is a person who looks for someone she can trust unconditionally.] in the original release) And once she finds that person, she'll do anything she can to keep them near.

That's according to Adrian Andrews herself. Phoenix: Then... That means her super-confident attitude... Edgeworth: It's all a fa\u00e7ade. She's only copying her mentor's behavior to hold herself together. Phoenix: (How terrible...)

She's only copying her mentor's behavior to hold herself together. Phoenix: (How terrible...) Present Suicide Report Edgeworth: I don't like to look through reports. I like suicide reports even less. Worst of all are the reports that have multiple parts like that one. That has two. Phoenix: ...Two parts? Edgeworth: What you just handed me is the first part of the report... Here is the second part. Phoenix: (The second part of the report is about an attempted suicide...) The attempter's name...! It's \"Adrian Andrews\"! Pearl: M-Ms. Andrews...? Um, what did she do? Phoenix: She... She tried to kill herself...? She doesn't seem like the kind of person to try to kill herself, though... (Changed from [She doesn't seem like the kind of person to try and kill herself...] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think she's a strong career woman? That's just what she wants you to think. (Changed from [You think she's a strong career woman? That is just her image.] in the original release) Adrian Andrews... She has a certain secret she's always trying to hide. Pearl: A secret...? Edgeworth: ...Her \"dependent nature\". That's what she's really like on the inside. (Changed from [...Her 'co-dependency'.

The word most unsuited to describing that woman...] in the original release) Attempted Suicide Report Edgeworth: Appearances can be deceiving. It's such a clich\u00e9 saying... But it's clich\u00e9 because it's true. Phoenix: Ms. Andrews... (To think that behind that unwavering, brave front... She's been hiding this weakness in fear...) Juan Corrida profile Edgeworth: There is an interesting rumor about this man... Phoenix: You mean the one about Ms. Andrews getting close to him? But that's pretty common tabloid fare, isn't it? Edgeworth: I don't take things at face value when there's more to be found... Matt Engarde profile Edgeworth: While I was abroad, these deplorable types of actors became popular, I take it. Phoenix: Well, \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" is his motto... Edgeworth: \"R-Refreshing\"!? And what is so refreshing about a spring breeze!? Phoenix: (Sounds like the pollen is not treating him well this year...) Adrian Andrews profile Edgeworth: Adrian Andrews... She holds a large secret within herself. Phoenix: A secret...? Edgeworth: You can't help but feel that this whole case revolves around her... Celeste Inpax profile Edgeworth: Hmm... This woman is another key to solving this case. (Changed from [Hmm... This woman is another key to the case.] in the original release) Phoenix: D-Do you really think so? Edgeworth: She was Adrian Andrews' mentor a long time ago, but she was suddenly called away by a different show, and became Juan Corrida's manager. (Changed from [but suddenly, she was called away by a production, and became Juan Corrida's manager.] in the original release) And then, a few months later... Celeste Inpax died. Phoenix: B-But her death was ruled a suicide, right? (Changed from [B-But her death was a suicide, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Yes. But there is still one riddle we've yet to solved... [sic] (Changed from [But there is still one riddle left unsolved...] in the original release) Phoenix: A riddle...? Edgeworth: Her suicide note. It went missing. No one could find it. Phoenix: (A suicide note that just vanished, huh...) Any other evidence Edgeworth: I have no interest in talking about useless evidence. Put a little more thought into what you show me... Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (Still as stuck up as ever...) Any other profile Edgeworth: We are looking into leads, but we can only look into a few key players with our limited resources. There's no reason for us to waste our energy investigating this person.

You're the one doing the following! Phoenix: Pearls... Pearl: You're always following after that Mr. Detective with the little beard! von Karma: ...Me? Following after Scruffy...?

Andrews: ... Why do you ask questions for which I have no answers? The truth is, I was not that close to Mr. Corrida. Phoenix: You were not that close...? Andrews: That's right. I've never been good at being intimate with another person. Phoenix: You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that. Present Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Leads to: \"You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: I'm very bad at connecting with people. They're so depressing for the most part. Phoenix: Um... Andrews: But I especially dislike feeble-minded individuals. Phoenix: Yes, well... Andrews: That's why I don't think I could ever be intimate with you. Phoenix: (So... I guess she's saying I'm both depressing and stupid...?) But I am certain you were very close with the victim. Andrews: Say that all you like, but you still don't have any proof. Leads to: \"You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that.\" Phoenix: You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...? Andrews: ... A silly third-rate tabloid article. If you even had half your wits about you, you wouldn't believe such rubbish. Phoenix: Well, it seems quite a few people bought into this story. Andrews: Hmph. As to be expected in a world filled with crooks and liars. Phoenix: (...Note to self: Stay on her good side.) Andrews: In any case, I despise interpersonal relationships like that. Phoenix: I see... However... What if there was a need for you to get close to someone...? Andrews: Me? Need to get close to Mr. Corrida? As if there was ever such a need.

Andrews: ...Y-You have a great imagination. You may have a future yet as a slimy muckraker for a putrid third-rate tabloid! Phoenix: M-Ms. Andrews...? Andrews: Th-There was no mystery surrounding her death. None. It would be pointless for me to force myself into a relationship for nothing! Phoenix: (Is that really true...?

Phoenix: It looks like the police were under the suspicion that someone had hidden it. Like maybe the person who discovered her body, Mr. Corrida. Andrews: J... Juan?

That is why you became intimate with Mr. Corrida! 1 LOCK BROKEN Andrews: I-I've sat by quietly and listened to your insulting ramblings long enough! Phoenix: ...

I'm a person who doesn't care about what goes on in the lives of others! Phoenix: (That's the impression you like to give, however...) I don't think that's who you really are. Andrews: What?

When Celeste passed away so suddenly like that... I died a death of my own. But... No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop thinking about what had become of her note. Phoenix: You must have heard about the police report... The one that said the police suspected Mr. Corrida of hiding Ms. Inpax's note... You heard about it, and thought to recover it from him by getting close, am I right? Andrews: ... Phoenix: If that's the case, then everything changes. Andrews: Wh-What do you mean?

It's the one thing I wanted to take with me to the grave... It was my secret. Mine and mine alone. Phoenix: I... I'm sorry. Andrews: You probably think I'm a worthless human being right now, don't you? Phoenix: Please, Ms. Andrews. All I want to know is the truth. Andrews: After Celeste passed away, I heard that someone had hidden her suicide note... And that someone was Juan Corrida. Celeste... Without her... Without her, I became scared. Everything... Everyone seemed like they were out to get me. Phoenix: So you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct? Andrews: ... Looks like that tabloid reported the truth after all. Ironic, isn't it? Phoenix: Well, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire. Andrews: And if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning. Pearl: ... Andrews: But as for the suicide note? I didn't and wouldn't kill anyone for it. It just doesn't suit me, that's all. Andrews: ... Well, that's enough for now. I still have work to do, so...

After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir. Judge: I see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe: After looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...? Gumshoe: Only a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana. Judge: Mmm... \"Banana\"... Gumshoe: Um, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir. Judge: Ah, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana. Phoenix: Then, what about the knife...? Gumshoe: It seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death. Judge: Hmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: The cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...? Gumshoe: Only a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo.

We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe: At first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you think that? Gumshoe: Because it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime. Judge: Oh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!? Gumshoe: Um, we thought of that too... But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: The only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's. Phoenix: Only the victim's, huh...? Judge: Hmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then... Guitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you think that? Gumshoe: Because it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime. Judge: Oh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!? Gumshoe: Um, we thought of that too... But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: The only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's. Phoenix: Only the victim's, huh...? Judge: Hmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe: However, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What convinced you it had nothing to do with the case? Gumshoe: The guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night. Judge: Well then, where was it? Gumshoe: The bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir. Judge: So you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...? Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar. Phoenix: So that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel... Gumshoe: Yeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all. Judge: Hmm...Mia: Our first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix: But there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia: Maybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix: If you say so...Mia: Of course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:Edgeworth: I believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge: Hmm...Edgeworth: Which brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix: (Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge: Very well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe: Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other. They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book. As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button. It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\". The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife. The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge: Hmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe: It was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe: ...And there's this button.Judge: That was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe: Yes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix: What!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge: All of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth: Yes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix: Hmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth: You can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix: Grrrrrrrrr...Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not? Gumshoe: ...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown. Phoenix: But Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end... Judge: That is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing. Edgeworth: ...Gumshoe: They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls! Gumshoe: Well, yeah, I guess, but... Phoenix: Which means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all! Judge: Hmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective? Gumshoe: Um, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired. Gumshoe: Eh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's... Edgeworth: I look forward to your pension negotiations. Gumshoe: N-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO! Judge: Now, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony. Gumshoe: *sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too... Edgeworth: Detective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir! Phoenix: (Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe: As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have any proof that button belonged to the victim? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: Oh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\". Gumshoe: Huh? But can't you tell by just looking at it? Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: A-And the victim's blood is on it. Phoenix: Anyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward. Gumshoe: ... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir! Phoenix: (Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...) Edgeworth: ...Thread. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: The button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal! Phoenix: Urk. Mia: That's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe: It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press Phoenix: Phoenix: When was this button found? Gumshoe: Pretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button. Judge: Hmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder... Edgeworth: The police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people... Phoenix: (Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe: The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How were the fingerprints arranged on the knife? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: By examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...? Gumshoe: Oh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that... Phoenix: (I can't believe the bumbling of this department...) Edgeworth: ...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder. Judge: Hmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe: The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife! Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either. Phoenix: (Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...) Mia: ...Phoenix. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: There's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wait a second!\"Phoenix: (A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia: Be grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix: We're still in a world of trouble...Mia: Well, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness.

So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix: Wait a second!Gumshoe: Wh-What?Phoenix: So the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe: That's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix: ...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe: H-Huh!?Phoenix: Take a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe: ...Huh?Judge: It has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe: \"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix: That's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe: ... Uh oh.Phoenix: The murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge: Yes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth: Heh heh heh...Judge: Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix: What!?Edgeworth: I think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix: H-How so!?Edgeworth: I admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe: ...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth: The question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge: Wh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth: Sorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge: There is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth: If it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix: Urk...Edgeworth: Mr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge: Amazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia: It seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix: (This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge: A murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth: I can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix: (Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia: He means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge: What does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Um, well...Mia: Phoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix: (That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge: Mr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do. Leads to: \"There's one...\"No, not right now. Phoenix: (This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.) Judge: Looks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one. Edgeworth: Which means this court is adjourned. Mia: Phoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick! Phoenix: (Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!) Phoenix: Leads to: \"There's one...\"Phoenix: There's one...Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: One piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge: Mr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth: What the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix: (If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge: You may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass Phoenix: Leads to: \"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong. Judge: I can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence. Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: I am a man of my word, Mr. Wright! Infinite penaltyJudge: This... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix: Please look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge: Hmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix: However! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge: ...Gumshoe: ...Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: W-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge: Ah, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix: Y-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge: You can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: What is it, Your Honor?Judge: Your opinion...Edgeworth: ...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix: ...What!?Edgeworth: It's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge: Hmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible. Phoenix: (It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...) Mia: You can't think like that, Phoenix. Phoenix: Mia... Mia: Right now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing! Phoenix: (So in other words, push as far as we can go...) Leads to: \"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way. Phoenix: (If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!) Mia: They just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough! Leads to: \"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix: The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge: Hmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix: (There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth: Unlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix: Wh-What!?Edgeworth: You're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix: Th-Then...Edgeworth: Of course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix: Fingerprints...Edgeworth: There were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge: Only one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth: They were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix: WHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth: That is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth: Ms. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge: Hmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth: Tsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix: Grrr!Edgeworth: I've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge: W-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix: \"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth: Yes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia: What in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth: Now then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag: ...Edgeworth: ... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth: Uurrngh!Oldbag: ...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth: Grrrrrrrrr...Phoenix: (I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag: Oh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth: I saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag: I tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge: Ms... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge: Oof!Oldbag: Shush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge: Yes, madam.Edgeworth: No no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag: It's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth: The witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag: It was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge: You mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag: Look, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix: (Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag: Anyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth: Very well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag: Leave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag: Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room. There was something I was interested in finding out, you know... Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time. That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room. It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge: Hmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag: See! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth: ...Judge: I see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag: Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag, what was your post on that night? Oldbag: The lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails. Phoenix: (Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...) Oldbag: Besides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little. Phoenix: And that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag: There was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Something you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that? Oldbag: It's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...? Edgeworth: I have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor. Phoenix: (\"Gossip\"...?) Edgeworth: If this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony. Mia: It looks like we shouldn't force it right now. Judge: Hmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag: Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Oh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room? Oldbag: I have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am! Judge: ...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report. Edgeworth: In any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag: That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who in the world was that!? Oldbag: I'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was... Judge: Yes...? He was...? Oldbag: ... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud! Phoenix: (Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...) Oldbag: Well, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag: It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!? Oldbag: Yessey! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Annoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person! Phoenix: (Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release)) The person's face Phoenix: Please tell the court about the man's face in more detail! Oldbag: You don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth! Phoenix: His teeth were... shining? Oldbag: Well, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie. Phoenix: ... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night! Oldbag: What? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!? Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all. Judge: *sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn. Oldbag: You've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me! Phoenix: (And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...) Leads back to cross-examination It was very important. Phoenix: Of course it was important, Your Honor! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important! Phoenix: You don't really have to put it that way to get me to say... Judge: Mr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...) Leads back to cross-examination What the person was carrying Phoenix: What was the man you saw carrying? Oldbag: In which hand? His right or his left? Phoenix: Um... Oldbag: Ah, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question! Judge: Indeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: S-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand? Oldbag: Ah, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand. Phoenix: Then how about his left? Oldbag: Empty. Phoenix: ... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...) Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important.

Oldbag: What a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters. Phoenix: But it does. Oldbag: Um... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing. Phoenix: What thing? Oldbag: That gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket. Phoenix: (Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...) Oldbag: That thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!! Phoenix: Um, right... Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all.

I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony. Judge: Hmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please... Oldbag: Ah well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must... Adds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"Press (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!? Oldbag: Yessey! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Annoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person! Phoenix: (Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)Oldbag: He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket? Oldbag: What do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it! Phoenix: (She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)Present Jammin' Ninja's Button Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Oldbag...\"Mia: She may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.Phoenix: That's bad for us. Really bad.Mia: But, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix: (That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag: Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag, what was your post on that night? Oldbag: The lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails. Phoenix: (Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...) Oldbag: Besides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little. Phoenix: And that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag: There was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Something you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that? Oldbag: It's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...? Edgeworth: I have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor. Phoenix: (\"Gossip\"...?) Edgeworth: If this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony. Mia: It looks like we shouldn't force it right now. Judge: Hmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag: Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Oh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room? Oldbag: I have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am! Judge: ...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report. Edgeworth: In any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag: That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who in the world was that!? Oldbag: I'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was... Judge: Yes...? He was...? Oldbag: ... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud! Phoenix: (Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...) Oldbag: Well, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag: It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!? Oldbag: Yessey! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Annoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person! Phoenix: (Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further...

She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag: See! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix: It was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag: See! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix: ...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag: ... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge: Now hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag: But when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag: Edgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth: Well, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix: Just say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge: Witness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!Oldbag: *sigh* Alright, if you insist.Phoenix: (I should be the one sighing, not you!)Witness Testimony-- Who I Saw --Oldbag: Engarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember! The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw! Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder. He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know. So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Phoenix: I... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!Oldbag: What? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix: But... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag: Ah, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge: H-How do you know that?Oldbag: Because... I said so. And what I say is the truth.Phoenix: (At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)Judge: Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Who I Saw --Oldbag: Engarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Would you please get on with your testimony! Oldbag: Hmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs! Phoenix: Uh, what? Oldbag: \"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\" Phoenix: (...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!? Edgeworth: Witness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts. Oldbag: OKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!? Edgeworth: Wright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date. Phoenix: (Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)Oldbag: The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Be a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!? Oldbag: \"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream? Phoenix: ...Huh? Oldbag: What did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!? Phoenix: My dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!? Oldbag: See! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!? Phoenix: Well... Oldbag: \"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"! Phoenix: (Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?) Oldbag: All that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?Oldbag: Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why would that be? Oldbag: That way, no one could see his face, of course! Phoenix: But there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more! Oldbag: ... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say... Phoenix: (Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?) Oldbag: I got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag: He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show? Oldbag: Well, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing. Phoenix: And that included the Jammin' Ninja...? Oldbag: Of course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought. Judge: Hmm... I see. Oldbag: Well, anyway.Oldbag: So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai? Oldbag: As showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!? Phoenix: (Can I throw in the towel yet?)Present Knife Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please take a look at this.\"Phoenix: Hmm...Mia: You don't need to think too hard on this one.Phoenix: Huh?Mia: There's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...Phoenix: (Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)-- Secret Information --Oldbag: That Engarde is one evil, evil man!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You can't say something like that without proof! That's just slander! Oldbag: But it's true! That woman was getting intimate with poor Juan! Look! It says so right here, doesn't it!? \"Manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\" Phoenix: But the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"... Oldbag: What? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth! Phoenix: Um... Oldbag: Honestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip! Judge: Yes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?) Oldbag: Anyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touch\u00e9\"!Oldbag: He thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A scandal...? What do you mean by that? Oldbag: You're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...? Phoenix: Ah, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much! Oldbag: Well! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!Oldbag: So to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing! Oldbag: You must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth. And now, since you're in so much shock, you can't do anything right! Phoenix: (You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.) Oldbag: Alright then, sonny, show me what you've got! Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!? Present evidence Phoenix: I'm not going to let you push me around that easily! Oldbag: Heh. There's many a man who've said those exact words and paid dearly for them. Phoenix: Maybe you should brace yourself this time! Here is my proof that Mr. Engarde did not hold any ill-will towards the victim! Present anything Phoenix: Oldbag: ...Is that it? You can take it from here, Edgey-poo! Edgeworth: Ngrk! Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!? (Changed from [EH!? Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!?] in the original release) Oldbag: I want you to give that jagged-headed baboon-boy a message for me! Please? Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing. Edgeworth: Um... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy! Judge: Yes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy. Phoenix: (Did I just gain a new nickname here...?) Leads to: \"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\" Decline the offer to present Phoenix: ...I don't have anything to offer. Oldbag: Seeeeeee! Just as I thought. Leads to: \"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\" Oldbag: And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof! You've just given me a free pass to say whatever I want whenever I want, silly boy! Phoenix: (Me and my big mouth...) Oldbag: That's the way the cookie crumbles. For you, anyway.Oldbag: I cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...? Oldbag: Like I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need! Judge: You were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...? Oldbag: I was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this! Judge: N-No, stop! Oldbag: Well, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.Oldbag: ...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait! Oldbag: What!? I'm a busy woman! Tea time with the kids is over! Phoenix: Secret information that no one else knows yet... If that's true, then how do you know this \"secret information\"!? Oldbag: Huh!? Well... That's... because I'm a pro... Yes, that's it... Phoenix: ... Oldbag: I-It's a secret! Even if you drill a hole into my brain, you'll never find out! Phoenix: (How in the world did that old bat get such a \"secret\" piece of information...?) Press further Phoenix: If you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today! Oldbag: Umm... Edgey-boy! What are you doing!? Help me! Edgeworth: Eh!? What do I have to do with this!? Oldbag: Just do this for me... You'll get your reward. Edgeworth: Hmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head! Phoenix: (And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?) Judge: As long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning. Phoenix: (Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!) Leads back to cross-examination Present evidence Phoenix: So no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...? Oldbag: Wh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that! Phoenix: Witness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release) Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"! Judge: Objection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue. Oldbag: Okie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down! Phoenix: (Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...) Leads back to cross-examination Wait and see Phoenix: (I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...) Leads back to cross-examinationMia: Sounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.Phoenix: (Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)Mia: There has to be something we can catch her on...Phoenix: (Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)Phoenix: The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...Judge: Oh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.Phoenix: She reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.Judge: She reported such a thing...?Phoenix: On that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.Oldbag: Wh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?Phoenix: No no no, I said impressions.Oldbag: Then... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?Phoenix: Ah! That's it! That's the note!Oldbag: Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!Judge: Hmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?Oldbag: I'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!Phoenix: ...Judge: ...Edgeworth: ...Oldbag: ... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?Edgeworth: Nngh...Oldbag: I was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!Edgeworth: You really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.Judge: Well, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.Phoenix: (She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)Pile on more pressure. Phoenix: (If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!) Leads to: \"Witness!\"Forgive her. Phoenix: I guess we should forgive her. Oldbag: Hmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent! Phoenix: Grr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.) Mia: Phoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Mia: You should be pressing her until she gives in! Phoenix: (Mia is really scary today... *gulp*) Leads to: \"Witness!\"Phoenix: Witness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?Oldbag: S-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!Phoenix: You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!Oldbag: Are you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Oldbag!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Hmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling? Phoenix: Um... Judge: I'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections! Phoenix: (Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!) Leads back to: \"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?Judge: A camera...?Phoenix: Yesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"Judge: Why... Why... Witness!!Oldbag: What is it, gramps?Phoenix: If you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!Oldbag: Grr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?Phoenix: Ah, that's...!Oldbag: What!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!Judge: Um... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...Oldbag: I saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!Judge: Bailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?Edgeworth: There is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.Judge: Please present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!Oldbag: See, I told you! That's the guy I saw!Judge: This proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.Judge: Wh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth: This photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge: If that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth: The defendant.Judge: How did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix: (If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it. Phoenix: There is nothing strange with this photo. Edgeworth: Hmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright. Judge: I see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial. Mia: Is this really alright with you, Phoenix!? Phoenix: W-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi-- Mia: Try again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor! Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards. Phoenix: Um, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait... Edgeworth: Oh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo? Judge: Wh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!? Leads to: \"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it. Leads to: \"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix: There's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth: I knew this was coming, Wright.Judge: Your thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: I think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge: \"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: ... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge: If you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix: Um... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)Judge: Now then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?Present Nickel Samurai's feet Phoenix: Leads to: \"I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\"Present Nickel Samurai Phoenix: Phoenix: It's this person here, of course!

Which means this Nickel Samurai is a fa-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you think that's all it takes, you should reconsider your choice of occupation. Phoenix: Urk. Edgeworth: I think it's about time you retired! Judge: Hmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all. Edgeworth: The problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor. Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: You are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright!

What does that mean...?Phoenix: The costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)Judge: What is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.Phoenix: Let's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge: His... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix: Exactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: There is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia: That's curious...Phoenix: Huh? What is?Mia: Edgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix: That's true...Mia: He's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix: \"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia: I can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix: (He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth: ...Judge: If the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix: WHAT!?Edgeworth: Wright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix: (Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia: Don't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix: (Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge: Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?Present Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Are you saying this is who you think was in the costume...? Phoenix: Uh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see? Mia: I can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places... Phoenix: (Argh... And I really thought I had it!) Judge: Now then, would you care to try one more time? Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"Judge: A-Adrian Andrews...?Phoenix: If you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!Edgeworth: And why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix: For starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge: And how does that all add up?Phoenix: It means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge: The knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth: Why don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix: (I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!Judge: Order! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor?Judge: This court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: (Alright! This is it...)Mia: This... is kind of bad for us.Phoenix: Huh? What do you mean?Mia: If Adrian Andrews is summoned to court as a witness... It means that the trial will go on for another day.Phoenix: One more day...? Ack!!

I request that you please continue with today's trial.Judge: B-But... We cannot continue due to this unexpected development!Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk. \"Unexpected\" development? I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.Judge: And what do you mean by that...?Edgeworth: That Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan... Even if Wright was a bit slow to catch on...Phoenix: Wh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge: What is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth: Ms. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.Phoenix: ...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)Mia: Somehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.Edgeworth: Exactly.Judge: Very well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess.

I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix: She is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde: So after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix: See, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde: Hmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix: Yes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde: But... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix: She has her own agenda.Engarde: H-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix: I'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde: Get me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia: Phoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix: ...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia: ...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix: And that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia: That sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix: Um, what...?Mia: Who was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...?

Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth: The prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court.

Now then...Andrews: Before we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge: Uh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews: I'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge: Ah, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix: (If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth: Anyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews: Yes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge: Hmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews: But I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth: No one has accused you of that.Andrews: I think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix: ...!Judge: I think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth: Very well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews: It was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room. After that, I went to Juan's room. And there was his dead body. I... I was in shock... What I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo. I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.Judge: You poured yourself a glass of juice...?Andrews: Yes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth: And that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge: I see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia: Phoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix: Yes... I know.Mia: In order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix: Disrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia: She's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it.

Understand?Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews: It was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...?

Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes? Andrews: Excuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room? Andrews: ...No. Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Subject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.Andrews: After that, I went to Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you do that...?

Press further Phoenix: Is that the only reason? Andrews: I beg your pardon? What are you implying...? Phoenix: You had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...?

When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct? Andrews: And what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time. Phoenix: Your mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you. Andrews: Aren't you rude today?

Edgeworth: Wh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!? Andrews: I'm sorry...

Andrews: It was a glass vase... and it was fairly big and heavy. I thought I would try to take Juan's pulse... So I set the glass I was holding down on the dresser. And that's when my elbow accidentally hit the vase... Phoenix: (That's odd. I thought she was always in total control of herself...?) Mia: That's what she would like people to think.

I just have to! ...For Maya's sake...)Phoenix: You testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?Andrews: Yes.Phoenix: And are you sure it fell onto the guitar case?Andrews: I-Is there some problem with what I said...?Phoenix: It's not \"some\" problem, it's a \"major\" problem. It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the inside, not the outside!Judge: Th-That's very true!Phoenix: Furthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.Judge: And wh-what is that?Phoenix: Let's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.Judge: And what is wrong with that?Phoenix: If the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!Andrews: Ah!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: What is your point, Wright!? That the case was closed at the time the vase was knocked over? Is that all!?Phoenix:Phoenix: No. Think back to what Ms. Andrews testified to! She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!Edgeworth: Nngh...Judge: Yes, that's right... She did implicitly say she didn't touch the guitar case!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: But... But this whole matter with the guitar case is a dead end! The bright red guitar was found at the studio! It has no bearing on this case at all!Phoenix: ... That may very well be, however... (Argh, the empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case, doesn't it...) (Changed from [An empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case...] in the original release)Judge: Hmm... It seems that there is no deeper meaning to the guitar case. Well, Mr. Wright?

Judge: Now then, let's move on to a different matter... Phoenix: Phoenix: Actually, Your Honor, I've changed my mind. I would like her to testify about the case.

I can't believe ANYONE would reach for straws like this! But it is you...Phoenix: (I can't believe I'm doing this either...)Judge: Alright. I'll follow along... For now. Ms. Andrews, please testify to the court about the guitar case.Andrews: Yes, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- The Guitar Case --Andrews: I don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed. I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over. It's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all. As for why I opened the case...

This is a photograph...!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: And why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one? Judge: Why, Mr. Wright, why? Phoenix: Well... I just thought it might have been possible...? Edgeworth: I have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be! Judge: Yes, and never bring it out again!

Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?Phoenix: That insane point would be to wear the costume, of course.

After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?Andrews: ...!Edgeworth: I-I refuse to accept your theory!

It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?Mia: Nice job, Phoenix.Phoenix: Well, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!Judge: Hmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: W-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?Judge: Hmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?It was stolen from Engarde. Phoenix: I think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde... Judge: S-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!? Phoenix: Maybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: And so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Maybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court! Phoenix: E-EXCUSE ME!? Edgeworth: Mr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!? Phoenix: ... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he? Judge: *sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\"It was a spare costume. Leads to: \"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\"Phoenix: Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.Edgeworth: What...?Judge: Then... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?Phoenix: Yes, that is what I am saying.Judge: And how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?Edgeworth: It would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)Judge: But... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?Phoenix: ... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Wh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?Phoenix: Huh!? N-No, I just...Judge: Mr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?Mia: Phoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!Phoenix: Alright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...Present Press Conference Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"What is this...?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!? Phoenix: I... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said! Mia: I told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"! Phoenix: *gulp* Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Ah, sorry... Mia: This one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it! Judge: Now then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time? Leads back to: \"Alright. This is what I think.\"Judge: What is this...?Phoenix: On the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.Judge: A press conference...?Phoenix: Yes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.Edgeworth: I heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.Phoenix: But what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.Andrews: ...Judge: But how can that be!?Phoenix: The way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!Judge: Th-The victim?Phoenix: Yes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!Judge: He was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?Phoenix: That's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.Edgeworth: The Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".Phoenix: Which means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!Judge: Yes, I guess that is what it would mean...Edgeworth: But, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!Andrews: Hmph.Judge: M-Ms. Andrews...?Andrews: I can see why you are pros at what you do.Judge: Pardon me?Andrews: Yes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.Judge: Ms. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!Andrews: I was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.Judge: You...!?Andrews: Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.Judge: He was going to ruin him, huh...?Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!Phoenix: What!?Judge: And do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?Andrews: ... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.Judge: Ah... I see.Edgeworth: ...Andrews: I... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...Phoenix: P-Protect Mr. Engarde!?Judge: And yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!Andrews: Yes, Your Honor. I understand.Witness Testimony-- Protecting Matt --Andrews: From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer. Matt had to kill Juan no matter what. And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder. My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife... But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...Judge: Hmm... This does account for everything...Andrews: Well... I am the logical type.Mia: We're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.Judge: If the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release)Phoenix: (Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Protecting Matt --Andrews: From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Would you say that was your \"intuition\" speaking to you? Andrews: Don't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own. Phoenix: Urk... Andrews: If you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things. Phoenix: Three... things? Andrews: A motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear. Mia: You should have already known that, Phoenix... Phoenix: They didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember... Andrews: May I continue now?Andrews: Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference? Andrews: Yes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde. Judge: And you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews? Andrews: Yes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume. Phoenix: But... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference. Andrews: Oh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference? Phoenix: A-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony! Judge: Yes, I agree. Ms. Andrews, please correct your testimony, if you please. Andrews: \"Grasping at straws\" now, are we, Mr. Wright? Changes statement from \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" to \"I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\"Andrews: I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Has Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally? Andrews: ... Why do you ask? Phoenix: You were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out! Andrews: ... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern. In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill. Phoenix: (Why do I keep doing this to myself...?)Andrews: And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: B-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!? Andrews: I'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time. Judge: Hmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however. Phoenix: (The judge is glaring straight at Mia...) Mia: He's glaring at you, smart guy!Andrews: My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage! Andrews: Then... What about the button? Phoenix: The button...? Andrews: It's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume. Judge: You're talking about this button, correct? Andrews: That button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence. Phoenix: Urk. Judge: Looks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: A-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony! Andrews: I can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat. Mia: ... Phoenix: (... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...) Mia: With an icy stare, yes. Judge: Ms. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony. Changes statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\"Andrews: That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how do you know that? Andrews: When the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard. Phoenix: (Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?) Andrews: Don't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not! Phoenix: (Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?)Present Juan's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the victim's autopsy report.\"Andrews: But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time. Andrews: ! Edgeworth: Who's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it? Phoenix: This witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness. Andrews: ...Phoenix: As I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.Mia: Really? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.Phoenix: Wishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)Mia: You should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.Phoenix: Got it, Chief!

    "cot": "Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to find which evidence contradicts one of Adrian Andrews' testimonies. The testimonies given by Andrews are all part of her \"Protecting Matt\" testimony. Let's look through each one.\n\nTestimony 0: She felt Matt was the murderer from the start. Not sure what evidence contradicts that yet.\n\nTestimony 1: Matt had to kill Juan. The motive was the press conference. But evidence like the Press Conference Ticket (3) shows Juan set it up to expose Matt's secret. But how does this contradict?\n\nTestimony 2: She knows the motive but can't prove it. The motive relates to Juan's plan, which is covered by the Press Conference Ticket. Maybe not a direct contradiction here.\n\nTestimony 3: Matt didn't have an alibi. But wait, Andrews said she went to his room and he was asleep. The Spy Camera (21) or Video Tape (29) might show he was there, but those might not be relevant here.\n\nTestimony 4: The button and knife confirmed her thoughts. The button (16) was found on Matt, but the knife (15) has Engarde's prints. But that's supporting her testimony, not contradicting.\n\nTestimony 5: The button was torn off during the fight. The Autopsy Report (14) says cause of death was strangulation, then stabbing. If the button was torn during the fight, but the fight would have been after strangulation. Wait, if Juan was already dead when stabbed, the fight couldn't have happened. So maybe the button being ripped off during a fight contradicts the autopsy report. But which testimony does that contradict?\n\nWait, looking at the testimony in the list, Testimony 5 says the button was torn off during Matt's fight with Juan. But according to the Autopsy Report (14), Juan was strangled to death first, then stabbed. If he was already dead when stabbed, the fight where the button was torn couldn't have happened. So the button being torn off in a struggle contradicts the actual cause of death, which was strangulation. Therefore, Testimony 5 (button torn during fight) is contradicted by the Autopsy Report (14) showing he was strangled first, making a struggle after death impossible. But in the given evidences, the Autopsy Report is Evidence 14. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 5 and Evidence 14.\n\nWait, but the user wants the answer in the format of evidence and testimony numbers. Let me check the indexes.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nTestimony 5 is \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\" (Index 5)\n\nEvidence 14 is Juan's Autopsy Report, which states cause of death as strangulation first, then stabbing. So if the button was torn during a fight, but Juan was already dead from strangulation before the stabbing, the fight couldn't have happened. Therefore, the testimony that the button was torn during the fight is contradicted by the autopsy report showing he was already dead (strangled) before any struggle involving the button.\n\nSo the correct pair would be evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) and testimony 5 (button torn during fight)."

There's signs of a struggle everywhere. Gumshoe: Well, yeah. During the fight, his button came off... Phoenix: (Mr. Engarde said something about a button...

Gumshoe: Ms. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race. Phoenix: O-Oh... Gumshoe: She's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't... Phoenix: (He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...) Matt Engarde profile Gumshoe: Hey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so. Phoenix: One dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money? Gumshoe: I... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's... Phoenix: (It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!) Pearl: Mr. Nick... Security Lady profile Gumshoe: I thought she was an alien from outer space. Phoenix: Yeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet. Gumshoe: Nah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal. Phoenix: ... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean... Adrian Andrews profile Gumshoe: She's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\". Phoenix: Yeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together. Gumshoe: Compared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up. Phoenix: (I feel sort of bad for him...) Anything else Phoenix: What do you know about this? Gumshoe: Um... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast... After clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass: ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... Pearl: Wh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: (Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...) Gumshoe: It's Ms. von Karma... Pearl: Huh? Gumshoe: For some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release) Gumshoe: S-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww! von Karma: At last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?) von Karma: So you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you! Phoenix: (Owww!) von Karma: Hey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat! Gumshoe: Ah! von Karma: I didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful... Gumshoe: Uwaah! von Karma: Detective! Come over here for a second! Gumshoe: Yeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow! von Karma: ...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment. Phoenix: (He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...) von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine! Phoenix: ... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...? von Karma: Wh-What...!? Phoenix: ... von Karma: ... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! von Karma: This isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor! Phoenix: (Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?) Gumshoe: ...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you... Examine Paper on desk Pearl: Mr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...? Phoenix: It's called an \"autograph\". Pearl: Auto-graff? Phoenix: It's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph. Pearl: I can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this. Phoenix: Ah, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here? Pearl: Th-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone! Phoenix: (Hold on...) Pearl: ...? Phoenix: Wendy... I've heard that name somewhere before... Mr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record. After visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room: March 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall Powers: Oh, Mr. Wright! How are you? Phoenix: Ah, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time? Powers: Yeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave... Talk The Nickel Samurai Phoenix: Can you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show? Powers: OK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\". Phoenix: I see... Powers: This time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo! Phoenix: I see... ... W-Wait... A love what...? Powers: A love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time. Phoenix: Oh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl? Powers: Anyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader! Phoenix: Sounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three. Powers: Y-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies. Pearl: Um... Powers: Yes, Pearl? Pearl: Wh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she? Powers: Every Sunday at 8 AM. Pearl: I'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week! Phoenix: (I can't believe she's really considering it!) Jammin' Ninja Phoenix: So what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like? Powers: It started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star. Phoenix: ...Uh, what? Powers: He was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm. Phoenix: A... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!? Powers: And then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3! Phoenix: Aww, that's too bad for him... Powers: Y-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like. Pearl: Um... Powers: Yes, Pearl? Pearl: Wh-What happens next!? I want to know! Pearl: Jammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!? Powers: Every Sunday at 8 AM. Pearl: Umm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm... Phoenix: (I can't believe she's really  considering it!) The gossip on Adrian (appears after presenting Adrian Andrews profile) Phoenix: Would you mind telling me about this \"gossip\"? Powers: Ah, so you ARE interested in it! I figured you would be! (Changed from [Ah, so you're interested in it too! I figured you would be!] in the original release) Phoenix: Yeah. Powers: I have such a weakness for celebrity gossip, too. Phoenix: O-Oh really... You too, huh...? Powers: Yeah. So take a look at this! Phoenix: (Looks like a tabloid Ms. Oldbag would read...) Alright, let's see here... \"Jammin' Midnight Rendezvous!?\" Powers: \"...to the mysterious, yet beautiful manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\" ...Y-You see now, don't you? Phoenix: What...? Powers: You can stop pretending to be in the dark, Mr. Wright! Juan Corrida didn't have a manager of his own. Which means if we're talking about a certain manager with the initials A. A.... Phoenix: ... Adrian Andrews...? Powers: Y-Yes, exactly! This is big news!! Phoenix: (But... It seems kind of odd. That woman, Ms. Andrews... Together with the biggest rival of her client...?) Powers: Ah, it's that wonderful thing that can only happen between two people... Pearl: Mr. Powers looks so happy. Phoenix: (Pearls is just following along, not having any idea as to why he's smiling...) Powers: Well, like the saying goes, one man's garbage is another man's treasure.

Present Radio Transceiver Powers: I can't believe it... A kidnapping... Pearl: Do you remember what the person looked like who gave this to you? Powers: It was that bellboy. And... And I didn't suspect a thing because he looked like such a normal old man... Phoenix: (Old man, huh...) Guitar Case Powers: That guitar case... That was Juan's... Phoenix: I'm guessing you've seen this case before? Powers: It's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar. Phoenix: (The bright red guitar... The Jammin' Ninja's signature item.) Pearl: But if the guitar is so important, how could he forget it for the award ceremony? Phoenix: (That does seem a little strange...) Maya Fey profile Powers: I... I'm sure he won't hurt her and he'll let her go soon... Phoenix: Yeah... Powers: Mr. Wright. I believe in you. You will save her! Phoenix: Thanks. Security Lady profile Powers: I never would've thought I'd see her here of all places. The last time we saw each other was during that really bad incident... You know... I mean, when I look back now, I think of the good things, so it's not so bad, I guess. Phoenix: Yeah, I would love to go back in time and relive a few of those good things... *chuckle* Powers: Th-That's not funny... Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess not...) Adrian Andrews profile Powers: Hey, that's Ms. Andrews! She's Matt's manager. Actually, I was interested in her for a little bit. Just a little... Phoenix: (Hmm... So Mr. Powers likes this type of woman...) What do you know about Ms. Andrews...? Powers: Well, see... Here's the thing. I don't really KNOW her know her... you know? Pearl: ...! Powers: There's sort of a small rumor going around about her right now... Pearl: A rumor...? Powers: Ah! If you're interested, I can give you a little bit of the details! Phoenix: (He's so happy, he looks like a lion that's just found his next meal...) Detention Center Present Magazine Clipping Phoenix: What do you think about this article...? Engarde: ... Hmph. If you're talking about her thing with Juan, I always thought she was a bit careless in the way she handled it... ... Phoenix: And that's it? Engarde: ...That's it. Adrian Andrews profile Engarde: That's my manager. Did you meet her? Phoenix: Uh, yeah. Engarde: What do you think? Strong woman, right? And she takes good care of me...

Oldbag: I tell you, I saw him that night. I saw him coming out of Juan's room. Phoenix: You're kidding! Pearl: Oh no! Oldbag: It was about ten minutes before Juan's body was discovered. It was just a coincidence. I was on my way to the toilet, minding my own business. Phoenix: And...? Did you tell that to the police? Oldbag: Well, of course! I thought I could get a gift certificate or two out of it, maybe more. Pearl: Gift certificate...? Oldbag: I've been recruited again for that part at the trial. You know, the trial tomorrow? This time, you're gonna get it! I'm gonna work hard to get your client pronounced guilty! Pearl: But Mr. Engarde hasn't done anything bad... Oldbag: I don't care about details like that! I know he did my dear poor Juan in! I just do! That yellow-bellied chicken! Pearl: A yellow-bellied chicken...? I wonder what that would look like... Oldbag: I trust my senses. I know when someone did something bad, and I say he did it! Phoenix: (What did Mr. Engarde ever do to her to deserve this...?)

He created that scandal that plagued poor Juan! Pearl: Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Pearl: What's a \"skan-dal\"? Phoenix: Oh... Um, I'll tell you about that after we get home, OK? Oldbag: Poor Juan, led astray by the wiles of that vile temptress... Pearl: Mr. Nick... What do \"viles\" and \"wile temptress\" mean...? Phoenix: Ack! Um, how about we just listen to what Ms. Oldbag has to say for now, OK Pearls? So, Ms. Oldbag. Who is this \"woman\" you're talking about...? Oldbag: ...Adrian Andrews, of course! Who else!? That guy, he shoved the girl onto Juan on purpose! Phoenix: His own manager? But why...? Oldbag: I thought lawyers were smart! It was to create a scandal to make Juan lose face! That girl drove Juan into a scandal that dragged his reputation through the mud! Phoenix: (Sounds like a pretty standard definition of a scandal to me...) Why do you know about that anyway, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: I'm one of Juan's biggest fans! I'm always out there gathering information! There's nothing I don't know! Phoenix: And do you have proof that Mr. Engarde did what you say he did...? Oldbag: Next week's issue of a certain magazine says so! Phoenix: (Ugh... Of course. A tabloid...) Pearl: Next week...

But yeah, ask me about things that have to do with the case only, alright pal? Gumshoe: She was the victim's manager and was also Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor. It's been two years since her suicide, and now those two are linked again by another death. Or maybe it's just a coincidence...? But... Waaah! von Karma: I'm getting sick of dealing with one foolish idiot after another... Gumshoe: M-M-Ms. von Karma! von Karma: You can't seem to stop allying yourself with the enemy, can you? I don't need a traitor in my midst. Gumshoe: Y-Y-You don't... You don't mean... von Karma: I do. Scruffy. You have thirty minutes to get out of here. You are no longer needed. Good bye. Pearl: Th-That's... Gumshoe: W-Wait... Please wait, sir! If I don't get this month's pay, I'll star-- von Karma: Quiet!

Pearl: Th-This person... This is Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: What am I going to do with you...? Still blaming others when things go wrong? You haven't changed a bit, Franziska. von Karma: ... ... ... Y... You... How dare you show your face to me without a shred of shame upon it!? You've soiled the Von Karma name, dragged it through the mud...

(Changed from [Run away with your tail between your legs like the ill-bred dog you are!] in the original release) Edgeworth: Are you talking about the Von Karma family creed? \"To be perfect in every way...\" Then let's hear it, Franziska. How are things going? I hear you are having a rough time maintaining perfection in this country. von Karma: Y-You! Edgeworth: You seem to be getting crushed under the weight of it all. That's why I came back. von Karma: Keep your assumptions to yourself! I... I haven't given in yet! I won't lose! This case is mine! I'll never hand it over to you! Never! Mr. Phoenix Wright! I will see you tomorrow... In court. It will be a clinical lesson on the meaning of \"total victory\"! Edgeworth: Hmph. Still the same wild mare she always was. Phoenix: ... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hang in there! You'll be OK, buddy! You're not injured that badly! A hang nail isn't... ...H-Hey. Gumshoe! GUMSHOE! GUMSHOOOOOOOOOE!!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for when a fellow officer is injured. Talk Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: I thought you, the Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, had gone and died! Pearl: Mr. Nick! Phoenix: I... I never wanted to see you again! Edgeworth: I think that's enough of a \"warm welcome\" for someone you haven't seen in a year... Phoenix: Are you going to run tomorrow's trial...? Edgeworth: ...You heard her, right? That wild mare hasn't given in yet, it seems. So, no, I don't think I'll be making an appearance. Pearl: ... Edgeworth: Your hatred for me is quite unhealthy. Not to mention one-sided. But I will say one thing... Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: You can't win on your own at the trial tomorrow. Phoenix: (What is that supposed to mean...?) Edgeworth: I have something definitive that you lack. And working together is the definition of teamwork. It's the power to find the truth. (Changed from [And that's the definition of teamwork. It's the power to find the truth.] in the original release) Phoenix: \"The truth\"...? Edgeworth: In order to understand this case, you have to understand a certain \"truth\". ...Well, if you ever feel the need for my assistance, it is available to you. I'm not in charge of this case, so I can be a bit more generous with information. Phoenix: (Just what is going on inside his head...?) \"Proof of Von Karma blood\" Edgeworth: A lot of things may have happened, however Manfred von Karma was still my mentor. And a \"perfect win record\" is proof of a Von Karma. Phoenix: ...One year ago, you could not establish guilt in a few cases... Are those losses the reason you suddenly disappeared from the Prosecutor's Office? Did you leave because you had lost your \"perfect win record\"...? Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: To think your motivation for prosecuting trials was so selfish... It'd been better for everyone if you never came back from the dead, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ... I see. Then let me ask you something. Why do YOU stand in the courtroom? What is your reason? Why stand in court? (appears after \"\"Proof of Von Karma blood\"\") Phoenix: Well, with Franziska, she almost always says, (Changed from [Well, if it was Franziska, she would almost definitely say,] in the original release) von Karma: \"I will defeat you this time!\" the instant she sees me.

I stand in the courtroom to defend my client. ...To save their lives. Edgeworth: To save your client, you say? Phoenix: Those who think only of their own ego-driven goals... Those kind of prosecutors are reprehensible to me. Even if you're a \"prodigy\"... Or someone like you, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ... It looks like there is still a lot you have yet to learn. Phoenix: \"A lot I have yet to learn\"? Me...? Edgeworth: ...Hmph. Well, that's enough for now. The time when you will see is coming soon enough... Missing suicide note (appears after presenting Celeste Inpax profile) Edgeworth: Ms. Inpax's death was most certainly a suicide. Of that there is no mistake. However, we could not find her suicide note. That's when the police began to suspect that someone had hidden it. Phoenix: The suicide note? But how do you know Ms. Inpax had even written such a note? Edgeworth: There was no solid evidence, however... We did find traces of ink on her right index finger. Which makes the likelihood of a suicide note very high. Phoenix: But who would hide such a thing...? Edgeworth: The police think it was Mr. Juan Corrida himself. Phoenix: Th-The victim...? Edgeworth: He was the one who found her body. Which makes him the only person who had a chance to hide her suicide note. Phoenix: (Mr. Corrida hid his own manager's suicide note...? But why...?) Edgeworth: As long as her note is missing, any speculation beyond this is meaningless... For now, I think you should look this over. This is the suicide report... Part one anyway...

Phoenix: And...? Edgeworth: And why did Adrian Andrews think about committing suicide...? Because she had apparently \"lost her will to live.\" (Changed from [Quite possibly because she had 'lost her will to live.'] in the original release) Phoenix: Lost her will...? But why would she...? Edgeworth: Her pillar of strength, her mentor Celeste Inpax, was gone forever. That's why. Phoenix: Wh-Why would that...? Pearl: Is this what they call, \"following someone to the grave\"...? Edgeworth: After her attempted suicide, Adrian Andrews started attending counseling sessions. She is someone who needs a person in whom she can trust absolutely.

Worst of all are the reports that have multiple parts like that one. That has two. Phoenix: ...Two parts? Edgeworth: What you just handed me is the first part of the report... Here is the second part. Phoenix: (The second part of the report is about an attempted suicide...) The attempter's name...! It's \"Adrian Andrews\"! Pearl: M-Ms. Andrews...? Um, what did she do?

Juan Corrida profile Edgeworth: There is an interesting rumor about this man... Phoenix: You mean the one about Ms. Andrews getting close to him? But that's pretty common tabloid fare, isn't it? Edgeworth: I don't take things at face value when there's more to be found... Matt Engarde profile Edgeworth: While I was abroad, these deplorable types of actors became popular, I take it.

This woman is another key to the case.] in the original release) Phoenix: D-Do you really think so?

(Changed from [but suddenly, she was called away by a production, and became Juan Corrida's manager.] in the original release) And then, a few months later... Celeste Inpax died.

Put a little more thought into what you show me... Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (Still as stuck up as ever...)

Andrews: ... Why do you ask questions for which I have no answers? The truth is, I was not that close to Mr. Corrida. Phoenix: You were not that close...? Andrews: That's right. I've never been good at being intimate with another person. Phoenix: You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that. Present Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Leads to: \"You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Andrews: I'm very bad at connecting with people. They're so depressing for the most part. Phoenix: Um... Andrews: But I especially dislike feeble-minded individuals. Phoenix: Yes, well... Andrews: That's why I don't think I could ever be intimate with you. Phoenix: (So... I guess she's saying I'm both depressing and stupid...?) But I am certain you were very close with the victim. Andrews: Say that all you like, but you still don't have any proof. Leads to: \"You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that.\" Phoenix: You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...? Andrews: ... A silly third-rate tabloid article.

Ironic, isn't it? Phoenix: Well, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire. Andrews: And if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning. Pearl: ...

That kidnapper is one to keep his word, it seems. Phoenix: I'm glad to hear she's safe... But Mia, how did you know...? Mia: As soon as she was locked up, Maya called for me. I read the note she left... Then I gathered as much information about her surroundings as I could. Phoenix: (I didn't know you could use spirit channeling like that... Pretty smart of her...) (Changed from [I didn't know you could use spirit channeling like this... Pretty smart of her...] in the original release) The kidnapper Phoenix: The kidnapper! What's he like!? Mia: I don't know... Apparently, Maya went to answer a phone call at the hotel and was drugged there... Phoenix: And!? Mia: She didn't see the face of her attacker. Phoenix: Argh... Present Anything Mia: Sorry, but I don't have time to answer your questions. Phoenix: (Yeah... And we should be worrying about Maya right now...) After clearing all Talk options: Mia: Maya is locked up in a very dark place right now. I'll tell you everything I heard when I was with her. Phoenix: When you were with her... Date:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0??? Maya: Nnngh... I'm starving... I could really go for some apple pie... I mean, at a time like this, sweets are the only way to go! I have to stay positive! He promised he wasn't going to kill me! I'm not going to die! (Sis... I wonder if you're with Nick right now...) Examine Bottles Maya: What's this...? It feels like there are a lot of glass bottles here. And these... They feel like barrels. I'll pass... Too bad I'm really hungry, and not really thirsty. Boxes Maya: There's all sorts of things piled up here... But it's too dark to see. Door Maya: Drat, it's locked. (Hmm, but this door's lock seems easy enough to open...) On TV, the hero always uses a plastic card or a stiff piece of cardboard... ...Then \"click\", they magically open the door. (I wonder if there's a card like that around here I could use...) Card Maya: Huh? Someone dropped a card here... It kinda looks like... a business card... But there's no name on it. Hmm... It's a picture of a seashell, I think... What a strange card. Move Maya: If I don't do something to the door first, I don't think I'll be \"moving\" anywhere... After examining door and card: Maya: Ah! That's it! This shell card! If I use this, maybe I can get the door open! This might be my key out of here! I had a feeling this card might be useful... I'm such a genius! Alright. Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Kidnapper... ...*click*... Maya: (I did it!) OK... Now I'm getting the heck out of here! (I shouldn't keep Nick waiting... Or worried.) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Maya Fey) Maya: I can't see very well in this darkness, but it doesn't seem like there's anything there...\n-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe: This murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Would you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony? Gumshoe: OK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later. Phoenix: And that's when the victim's body was found, correct? Edgeworth: Which is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period. Judge: Hmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe: The victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct? Gumshoe: ...Yeah. Judge: Who is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about? Gumshoe: She's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir. Judge: Ah, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence... Gumshoe: When the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir. Judge: I see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe: After looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...? Gumshoe: Only a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana. Judge: Mmm... \"Banana\"... Gumshoe: Um, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir. Judge: Ah, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana. Phoenix: Then, what about the knife...? Gumshoe: It seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death. Judge: Hmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: The cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...? Gumshoe: Only a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana. Judge: Mmm... \"Banana\"... Gumshoe: Um, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir. Judge: Ah, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana. Phoenix: Then, what about the knife...? Gumshoe: It seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death. Judge: Hmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe: At first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you think that? Gumshoe: Because it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime. Judge: Oh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!? Gumshoe: Um, we thought of that too... But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: The only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's. Phoenix: Only the victim's, huh...? Judge: Hmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then... Guitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you think that? Gumshoe: Because it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime. Judge: Oh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!? Gumshoe: Um, we thought of that too... But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: The only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's. Phoenix: Only the victim's, huh...? Judge: Hmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe: However, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What convinced you it had nothing to do with the case? Gumshoe: The guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night. Judge: Well then, where was it? Gumshoe: The bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir. Judge: So you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...? Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar. Phoenix: So that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel... Gumshoe: Yeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all. Judge: Hmm...Mia: Our first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix: But there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia: Maybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix: If you say so...Mia: Of course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:Edgeworth: I believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge: Hmm...Edgeworth: Which brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix: (Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge: Very well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe: Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other. They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book. As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button. It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\". The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife. The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge: Hmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe: It was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe: ...And there's this button.Judge: That was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe: Yes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix: What!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge: All of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth: Yes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix: Hmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth: You can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix: Grrrrrrrrr...Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not? Gumshoe: ...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown. Phoenix: But Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end... Judge: That is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing. Edgeworth: ...Gumshoe: They each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls! Gumshoe: Well, yeah, I guess, but... Phoenix: Which means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all! Judge: Hmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective? Gumshoe: Um, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired. Gumshoe: Eh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's... Edgeworth: I look forward to your pension negotiations. Gumshoe: N-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO! Judge: Now, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony. Gumshoe: *sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too... Edgeworth: Detective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir! Phoenix: (Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe: As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have any proof that button belonged to the victim? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: Oh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\". Gumshoe: Huh? But can't you tell by just looking at it? Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: A-And the victim's blood is on it. Phoenix: Anyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward. Gumshoe: ... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir! Phoenix: (Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...) Edgeworth: ...Thread. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: The button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal! Phoenix: Urk. Mia: That's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe: It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press Phoenix: Phoenix: When was this button found? Gumshoe: Pretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button. Judge: Hmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder... Edgeworth: The police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people... Phoenix: (Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe: The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How were the fingerprints arranged on the knife? Gumshoe: Huh? What do you mean, pal? Phoenix: By examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...? Gumshoe: Oh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that... Phoenix: (I can't believe the bumbling of this department...) Edgeworth: ...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder. Judge: Hmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe: The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife! Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either. Phoenix: (Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...) Mia: ...Phoenix. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: There's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wait a second!\"Phoenix: (A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia: Be grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix: We're still in a world of trouble...Mia: Well, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe: Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?

So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix: Wait a second!Gumshoe: Wh-What?Phoenix: So the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe: That's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix: ...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe: H-Huh!?Phoenix: Take a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe: ...Huh?Judge: It has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe: \"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix: That's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe: ... Uh oh.Phoenix: The murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge: Yes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth: Heh heh heh...Judge: Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix: What!?Edgeworth: I think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix: H-How so!?Edgeworth: I admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe: ...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth: The question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge: Wh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth: Sorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge: There is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth: If it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix: Urk...Edgeworth: Mr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge: Amazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia: It seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix: (This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge: A murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth: I can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix: (Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia: He means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge: What does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Um, well...Mia: Phoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix: (That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge: Mr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do. Leads to: \"There's one...\"No, not right now. Phoenix: (This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.) Judge: Looks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one. Edgeworth: Which means this court is adjourned. Mia: Phoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick! Phoenix: (Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!) Phoenix: Leads to: \"There's one...\"Phoenix: There's one...Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: One piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge: Mr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth: What the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix: (If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge: You may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass Phoenix: Leads to: \"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong. Judge: I can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence. Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: I am a man of my word, Mr. Wright! Infinite penaltyJudge: This... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix: Please look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge: Hmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix: However! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge: ...Gumshoe: ...Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: W-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge: Ah, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix: Y-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge: You can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: What is it, Your Honor?Judge: Your opinion...Edgeworth: ...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix: ...What!?Edgeworth: It's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge: Hmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible. Phoenix: (It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...) Mia: You can't think like that, Phoenix. Phoenix: Mia... Mia: Right now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing! Phoenix: (So in other words, push as far as we can go...) Leads to: \"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way. Phoenix: (If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!) Mia: They just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough! Leads to: \"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix: The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge: Hmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix: (There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth: Unlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix: Wh-What!?Edgeworth: You're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix: Th-Then...Edgeworth: Of course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix: Fingerprints...Edgeworth: There were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge: Only one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth: They were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix: WHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth: That is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth: Ms. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge: Hmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth: Tsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix: Grrr!Edgeworth: I've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge: W-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix: \"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth: Yes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia: What in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth: Now then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag: ...Edgeworth: ... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth: Uurrngh!Oldbag: ...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth: Grrrrrrrrr...Phoenix: (I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag: Oh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth: I saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag: I tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge: Ms... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun: *rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge: Oof!Oldbag: Shush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge: Yes, madam.Edgeworth: No no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag: It's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth: The witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag: It was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge: You mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag: Look, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix: (Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag: Anyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth: Very well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag: Leave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag: Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room. There was something I was interested in finding out, you know... Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time. That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room. It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge: Hmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag: See! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth: ...Judge: I see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag: Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag, what was your post on that night? Oldbag: The lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails. Phoenix: (Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...) Oldbag: Besides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little. Phoenix: And that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag: There was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Something you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that? Oldbag: It's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...? Edgeworth: I have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor. Phoenix: (\"Gossip\"...?) Edgeworth: If this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony. Mia: It looks like we shouldn't force it right now. Judge: Hmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag: Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Oh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room? Oldbag: I have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am! Judge: ...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report. Edgeworth: In any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag: That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who in the world was that!? Oldbag: I'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was... Judge: Yes...? He was...? Oldbag: ... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud! Phoenix: (Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...) Oldbag: Well, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag: It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You saw my client!? Are you sure about that!? Oldbag: Yessey! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Annoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person! Phoenix: (Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release)) The person's face Phoenix: Please tell the court about the man's face in more detail! Oldbag: You don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth! Phoenix: His teeth were... shining? Oldbag: Well, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie. Phoenix: ... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night! Oldbag: What? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!? Judge: So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way? Phoenix: Hmm... It was not important. Phoenix: I guess it really wasn't that important after all. Judge: *sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn. Oldbag: You've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me! Phoenix: (And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...) Leads back to cross-examination It was very important. Phoenix: Of course it was important, Your Honor! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important! Phoenix: You don't really have to put it that way to get me to say... Judge: Mr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor...

Phoenix: Um... Oldbag: Ah, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question! Judge: Indeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: S-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand? Oldbag: Ah, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand. Phoenix: Then how about his left? Oldbag: Empty. Phoenix: ...

Oldbag: That gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket. Phoenix: (Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...) Oldbag: That thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!! Phoenix: Um, right... Judge: So, Mr. Wright.

Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag: He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show? Oldbag: Well, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing. Phoenix: And that included the Jammin' Ninja...? Oldbag: Of course it included him!

That's just slander! Oldbag: But it's true! That woman was getting intimate with poor Juan! Look! It says so right here, doesn't it!? \"Manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\" Phoenix: But the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"... Oldbag: What? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth! Phoenix: Um... Oldbag: Honestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip! Judge: Yes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?) Oldbag: Anyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touch\u00e9\"!Oldbag: He thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A scandal...? What do you mean by that? Oldbag: You're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...? Phoenix: Ah, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much! Oldbag: Well! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!Oldbag: So to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing! Oldbag: You must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth. And now, since you're in so much shock, you can't do anything right! Phoenix: (You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.) Oldbag: Alright then, sonny, show me what you've got! Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!? Present evidence Phoenix: I'm not going to let you push me around that easily! Oldbag: Heh. There's many a man who've said those exact words and paid dearly for them. Phoenix: Maybe you should brace yourself this time! Here is my proof that Mr. Engarde did not hold any ill-will towards the victim! Present anything Phoenix: Oldbag: ...Is that it? You can take it from here, Edgey-poo! Edgeworth: Ngrk! Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!? (Changed from [EH!? Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!?] in the original release) Oldbag: I want you to give that jagged-headed baboon-boy a message for me! Please? Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing. Edgeworth: Um... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy! Judge: Yes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy. Phoenix: (Did I just gain a new nickname here...?) Leads to: \"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\" Decline the offer to present Phoenix: ...I don't have anything to offer. Oldbag: Seeeeeee! Just as I thought. Leads to: \"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\" Oldbag: And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof! You've just given me a free pass to say whatever I want whenever I want, silly boy! Phoenix: (Me and my big mouth...) Oldbag: That's the way the cookie crumbles. For you, anyway.Oldbag: I cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...? Oldbag: Like I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need! Judge: You were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...? Oldbag: I was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this! Judge: N-No, stop! Oldbag: Well, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.Oldbag: ...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait! Oldbag: What!? I'm a busy woman! Tea time with the kids is over! Phoenix: Secret information that no one else knows yet... If that's true, then how do you know this \"secret information\"!? Oldbag: Huh!? Well... That's... because I'm a pro... Yes, that's it... Phoenix: ... Oldbag: I-It's a secret! Even if you drill a hole into my brain, you'll never find out! Phoenix: (How in the world did that old bat get such a \"secret\" piece of information...?) Press further Phoenix: If you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today! Oldbag: Umm... Edgey-boy! What are you doing!? Help me! Edgeworth: Eh!? What do I have to do with this!? Oldbag: Just do this for me... You'll get your reward. Edgeworth: Hmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head! Phoenix: (And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?) Judge: As long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning. Phoenix: (Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!) Leads back to cross-examination Present evidence Phoenix: So no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...? Oldbag: Wh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that! Phoenix: Witness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release) Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"! Judge: Objection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue. Oldbag: Okie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down! Phoenix: (Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...) Leads back to cross-examination Wait and see Phoenix: (I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...) Leads back to cross-examinationMia: Sounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.Phoenix: (Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)Mia: There has to be something we can catch her on...Phoenix: (Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)Phoenix: The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...Judge: Oh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.Phoenix: She reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.Judge: She reported such a thing...?Phoenix: On that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.Oldbag: Wh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?Phoenix: No no no, I said impressions.Oldbag: Then... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?Phoenix: Ah! That's it! That's the note!Oldbag: Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!Judge: Hmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?Oldbag: I'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!Phoenix: ...Judge: ...Edgeworth: ...Oldbag: ... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?Edgeworth: Nngh...Oldbag: I was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!Edgeworth: You really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.Judge: Well, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.Phoenix: (She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)Pile on more pressure. Phoenix: (If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!) Leads to: \"Witness!\"Forgive her. Phoenix: I guess we should forgive her. Oldbag: Hmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent! Phoenix: Grr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.) Mia: Phoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Mia: You should be pressing her until she gives in! Phoenix: (Mia is really scary today... *gulp*) Leads to: \"Witness!\"Phoenix: Witness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?Oldbag: S-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!Phoenix: You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!Oldbag: Are you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Oldbag!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Hmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling? Phoenix: Um... Judge: I'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections! Phoenix: (Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!) Leads back to: \"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?Judge: A camera...?Phoenix: Yesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"Judge: Why... Why... Witness!!Oldbag: What is it, gramps?Phoenix: If you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!Oldbag: Grr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?Phoenix: Ah, that's...!Oldbag: What!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!Judge: Um... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...Oldbag: I saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!Judge: Bailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?Edgeworth: There is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.Judge: Please present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!Oldbag: See, I told you! That's the guy I saw!Judge: This proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.Judge: Wh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth: This photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge: If that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth: The defendant.Judge: How did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix: (If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it. Phoenix: There is nothing strange with this photo. Edgeworth: Hmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright. Judge: I see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial. Mia: Is this really alright with you, Phoenix!? Phoenix: W-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi-- Mia: Try again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor! Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards. Phoenix: Um, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait... Edgeworth: Oh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo? Judge: Wh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!? Leads to: \"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it. Leads to: \"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix: There's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth: I knew this was coming, Wright.Judge: Your thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: I think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge: \"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: ... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge: If you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix: Um... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)Judge: Now then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?Present Nickel Samurai's feet Phoenix: Leads to: \"I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\"Present Nickel Samurai Phoenix: Phoenix: It's this person here, of course!

Which means this Nickel Samurai is a fa-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you think that's all it takes, you should reconsider your choice of occupation. Phoenix: Urk. Edgeworth: I think it's about time you retired! Judge: Hmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all. Edgeworth: The problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor. Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: You are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright! Infinite penaltyPresent anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: The strange thing is somewhere around here! ...I think. Edgeworth: \"Somewhere\"...? Judge: \"Around here\"...? Mia: \"I think\"...?

Phoenix: W-Wait! Judge: You are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright! Infinite penaltyPhoenix: I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!Judge: Wh-What are you pointing to? His ankles...?Phoenix: If you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.Judge: A-And...? What does that mean...?Phoenix: The costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)Judge: What is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.Phoenix: Let's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge: His... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix: Exactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: There is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia: That's curious...Phoenix: Huh? What is?Mia: Edgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix: That's true...Mia: He's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix: \"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia: I can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix: (He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth: ...Judge: If the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth: ... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix: WHAT!?Edgeworth: Wright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix: (Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia: Don't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix: (Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge: Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?Present Adrian Andrews profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Are you saying this is who you think was in the costume...? Phoenix: Uh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see? Mia: I can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places... Phoenix: (Argh... And I really thought I had it!) Judge: Now then, would you care to try one more time? Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"Judge: A-Adrian Andrews...?Phoenix: If you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!Edgeworth: And why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix: For starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge: And how does that all add up?Phoenix: It means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge: The knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth: Why don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix: (I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!Judge: Order! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor?Judge: This court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: (Alright! This is it...)Mia: This... is kind of bad for us.Phoenix: Huh? What do you mean?Mia: If Adrian Andrews is summoned to court as a witness... It means that the trial will go on for another day.Phoenix: One more day...? Ack!!

I request that you please continue with today's trial.Judge: B-But... We cannot continue due to this unexpected development!Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk. \"Unexpected\" development? I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.Judge: And what do you mean by that...?Edgeworth: That Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan... Even if Wright was a bit slow to catch on...Phoenix: Wh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge: What is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth: Ms. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.Phoenix: ...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)Mia: Somehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.Edgeworth: Exactly.Judge: Very well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth: ...Judge: The court will now take a 10 minute recess.To be continued.March 22, 2:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Engarde: Dude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix: She is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde: So after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix: See, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde: Hmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix: Yes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde: But... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix: She has her own agenda.Engarde: H-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix: I'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde: Get me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia: Phoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix: ...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia: ...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix: And that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia: That sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix: Um, what...?Mia: Who was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)Phoenix: ...

Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth: The prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!Edgeworth: What is your occupation?Andrews: I am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge: I see. Now then...Andrews: Before we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge: Uh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews: I'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge: Ah, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix: (If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth: Anyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews: Yes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge: Hmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews: But I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth: No one has accused you of that.Andrews: I think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix: ...!Judge: I think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth: Very well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews: It was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room. After that, I went to Juan's room. And there was his dead body. I... I was in shock... What I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo. I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.Judge: You poured yourself a glass of juice...?Andrews: Yes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth: And that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge: I see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia: Phoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix: Yes... I know.Mia: In order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix: Disrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia: She's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews: It was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...? Andrews: He was taking a nap. He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony... Phoenix: (Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes? Andrews: Excuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room? Andrews: ...No. Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Subject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.Andrews: After that, I went to Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you do that...? Andrews: As a friendly gesture, Juan was to make an appearance with the other Heroes. Phoenix: (So the show was supposed to be a \"show\" of friendship, huh?) Press further Phoenix: Is that the only reason? Andrews: I beg your pardon? What are you implying...? Phoenix: You had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...? Andrews: ... Sorry, but I didn't have any such intentions in mind at that time. Phoenix: (I can't get her to talk without a strong piece of evidence, I guess...) Leads to: \"May we continue now...?\" Let her be Phoenix: (I should back off...

Was I not supposed to be? Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...) Edgeworth: Anyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.

When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct? Andrews: And what of it...?

This mess of glass shards!? Andrews: It was originally on top of the dresser... but when I bumped into it with my elbow, it fell... onto the guitar case. Edgeworth: Wh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!? Andrews: I'm sorry... I thought that since the crime scene was already in disarray, that people would simply assume the vase was just another part of the mess. Judge: It looks like yet another fact has come to light here.

Edgeworth: Wh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!? Andrews: I'm sorry... I thought that since the crime scene was already in disarray, that people would simply assume the vase was just another part of the mess. Judge: It looks like yet another fact has come to light here. Please add this and anything else you have to reveal to your testimony. Andrews: I'm sorry... But... I have nothing more to add... I didn't touch anything else. Edgeworth: ...

Andrews: He was taking a nap. He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony... Phoenix: (Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes? Andrews: Excuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room? Andrews: ...No. Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Subject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.Andrews: After that, I went to Juan's room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And why did you do that...? Andrews: As a friendly gesture, Juan was to make an appearance with the other Heroes. Phoenix: (So the show was supposed to be a \"show\" of friendship, huh?) Press further Phoenix: Is that the only reason? Andrews: I beg your pardon? What are you implying...? Phoenix: You had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...? Andrews: ... Sorry, but I didn't have any such intentions in mind at that time.

Was I not supposed to be? Phoenix: (Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...) Edgeworth: Anyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.

When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct? Andrews: And what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time. Phoenix: Your mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you. Andrews: Aren't you rude today?

The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.Judge: And what is wrong with that?Phoenix: If the guitar case was open when the vase fell...

Judge: Wh-Wh-Why are you changing your mind NOW!? Phoenix: (Well, looks like I disrupted the judge's pacing... Now comes the real deal... *gulp*) Leads to: \"The empty guitar case...\"Phoenix: The empty guitar case... I believe this is a crucial piece of the puzzle!Edgeworth: Heh! I can't believe ANYONE would reach for straws like this! But it is you...Phoenix: (I can't believe I'm doing this either...)Judge: Alright. I'll follow along... For now. Ms. Andrews, please testify to the court about the guitar case.Andrews: Yes, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- The Guitar Case --Andrews: I don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed. I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over. It's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all. As for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.Judge: Hmm... It looks like this really wasn't a very important point.Edgeworth: This wastefulness is such a familiar feeling by now that it's almost... comforting.Phoenix: Um, anyway, I'll just go ahead and start the cross-examination...Edgeworth: Hmph.

Well, maybe... Phoenix: ... Why did you open the guitar case? Andrews: Huh? Phoenix: Mr. Corrida's dead body was right there in front of you, wasn't it? I would think that the first thing you would do is call for help, not open a guitar case. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As the witness has said multiple times, when she found the dead body, she was \"dazed\". Judge: Hmm... Andrews: Maybe I...

We can't afford to let up on her now.Phoenix: I wasn't planning on letting up, but...Mia: She's at her weakest now, so this is our chance!Phoenix: (Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...)Mia: I'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found.Phoenix: I have your proof right here. This wine glass.Andrews: The wine glass?Phoenix: You left your fingerprints very clearly on this wine glass.Andrews: Ah...Phoenix: Even if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?Andrews: Ugn!Judge: Order! Order! Order!!Mia: Looks like you hit the nail on the head this time.Phoenix: ...? What do you mean?Mia: I believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.Phoenix: But it's just an empty case...Mia: I wonder if it really was empty though...Phoenix: B-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!Mia: Phoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.Phoenix: (You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)Judge: Hmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...Phoenix:Phoenix: No, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: If you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!Phoenix: Uh...Judge: Can you do that, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: Um, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...Judge: The bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--Edgeworth:Edgeworth: So, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?Phoenix: I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!Edgeworth: Deflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?Present The Nickel Samurai or Lotta's Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Th-This is... This is a photograph...!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: And why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one? Judge: Why, Mr. Wright, why? Phoenix: Well... I just thought it might have been possible...? Edgeworth: I have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be! Judge: Yes, and never bring it out again! Phoenix: (Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?) Edgeworth: Do you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder? Leads back to: \"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\"Judge: Th-This is... This is a photograph...!Phoenix: Yes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.Judge: I-In this picture...?Phoenix: It doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!Edgeworth: Wh-What!?Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!Edgeworth: Wright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?Phoenix: That insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?Andrews: ...!Edgeworth: I-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?Phoenix: Just outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?Judge: You... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?Mia: Nice job, Phoenix.Phoenix: Well, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!Judge: Hmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: W-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?Judge: Hmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?It was stolen from Engarde. Phoenix: I think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde... Judge: S-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!? Phoenix: Maybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: And so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Maybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court! Phoenix: E-EXCUSE ME!? Edgeworth: Mr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!? Phoenix: ... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he? Judge: *sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\"It was a spare costume. Leads to: \"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\"Phoenix: Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.Edgeworth: What...?Judge: Then... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?Phoenix: Yes, that is what I am saying.Judge: And how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?Edgeworth: It would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)Judge: But... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?Phoenix: ... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Wh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?Phoenix: Huh!? N-No, I just...Judge: Mr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?Mia: Phoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!Phoenix: Alright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...Present Press Conference Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"What is this...?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!? Phoenix: I... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said! Mia: I told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"! Phoenix: *gulp* Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Ah, sorry... Mia: This one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it! Judge: Now then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time? Leads back to: \"Alright. This is what I think.\"Judge: What is this...?Phoenix: On the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.Judge: A press conference...?Phoenix: Yes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.Edgeworth: I heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.Phoenix: But what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.Andrews: ...Judge: But how can that be!?Phoenix: The way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!Judge: Th-The victim?Phoenix: Yes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!Judge: He was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?Phoenix: That's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.Edgeworth: The Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".Phoenix: Which means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!Judge: Yes, I guess that is what it would mean...Edgeworth: But, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!Andrews: Hmph.Judge: M-Ms. Andrews...?Andrews: I can see why you are pros at what you do.Judge: Pardon me?Andrews: Yes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.Judge: Ms. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!Andrews: I was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.Judge: You...!?Andrews: Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.Judge: He was going to ruin him, huh...?Andrews: It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!Phoenix: What!?Judge: And do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?Andrews: ... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.Judge: Ah... I see.Edgeworth: ...Andrews: I... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...Phoenix: P-Protect Mr. Engarde!?Judge: And yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!Andrews: Yes, Your Honor. I understand.Witness Testimony-- Protecting Matt --Andrews: From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer. Matt had to kill Juan no matter what. And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder. My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife... But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...Judge: Hmm... This does account for everything...Andrews: Well... I am the logical type.Mia: We're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.Judge: If the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release)Phoenix: (Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again...

Andrews: Don't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own. Phoenix: Urk... Andrews: If you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things. Phoenix: Three... things? Andrews: A motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear. Mia: You should have already known that, Phoenix... Phoenix: They didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember... Andrews: May I continue now?Andrews: Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference? Andrews: Yes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde. Judge: And you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews? Andrews: Yes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume. Phoenix: But... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference. Andrews: Oh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference? Phoenix: A-Anyway!

Andrews: ... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern.

However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time. Judge: Hmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however. Phoenix: (The judge is glaring straight at Mia...)

The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage! Andrews: Then... What about the button? Phoenix: The button...? Andrews: It's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume. Judge: You're talking about this button, correct? Andrews: That button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence. Phoenix: Urk.

This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?Edgeworth: After the knife was stabbed into the victim...Phoenix: Exactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight!Andrews: Ah...Phoenix: That's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!Judge: Order! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--Edgeworth:Edgeworth: What is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?Phoenix: Let me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?Edgeworth: What \"purpose\"...?Phoenix: We now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it?Edgeworth: ...Judge: Mr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?To have a memento of the crime Phoenix: Maybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento... Edgeworth: Wright...

How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!Phoenix: I can't, can I? Would you care to test me?Andrews: Then... Then what about this knife!?Phoenix: The knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.Andrews: ...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?Phoenix: This button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!Andrews: Ughn...Phoenix: The only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.Judge: I... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?Phoenix: That is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!Andrews: N...No... I...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: But Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!Judge: ...! Th-That's right!Phoenix: That's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body!Andrews: Aaaaaah!Phoenix: And to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.Andrews: ...!Phoenix: Speaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?Andrews: P-Please... Stop...Phoenix: Well, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?Andrews: Um...Phoenix: (I've got her this time!)Andrews: ...Judge: Ms. Andrews...?Andrews: ... I... I... I refuse... to testify.Phoenix: What was that...?Andrews: Th-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!Judge: Well, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.Phoenix: WHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)von Karma: Adrian Andrews!Andrews: Y-Yes...?von Karma: Think hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?Andrews: A-Alright... ...Phoenix: (That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)Mia: You did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.Phoenix: Something I haven't done...?Edgeworth: Heh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?Phoenix: ...!Judge: What is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth: I'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.Phoenix: Wh-What!?Edgeworth: Everything you have proven is circumstantial.Phoenix: Circumstantial...?Edgeworth: Yes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!Judge: M-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?Andrews: I believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.Judge: But Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?Andrews: Maybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence.Phoenix: (NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?Mia: Somehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.Judge: I think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof.Phoenix: But! That's not true!Judge: In this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.Phoenix: R-Recess...!?Judge: I request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...Phoenix: (T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)Phoenix:Phoenix: Please wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!Edgeworth: What are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?Phoenix: That... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...Edgeworth: ...?Judge: But it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: It is not impossible for this trial to continue.Andrews: ...!Judge: Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...Edgeworth: It's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!Judge: Y-Yes, that is very true, but...Edgeworth: Actually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.Andrews: ...Edgeworth: When you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.Andrews: Y-Yes... And...?Edgeworth: I can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.Andrews: So my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already...Edgeworth: Before you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.Andrews: Testify...!?Edgeworth: Your Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.Judge: Hmm...Mia: I don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...Judge: The court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews: That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself. I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state. And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner. When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind. To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice. When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.Judge: Hmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?Andrews: ...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.Mia: Phoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...Phoenix: I know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)Judge: Now then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews: That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But... There wasn't anyone else in the room, right? Andrews: Of course not. Phoenix: Then... who did you pour it for? Andrews: Mr. Wright. There is a rhyme and reason for everything. Can you wait just a little longer for it to be revealed to you? Edgeworth: In other words, Wright, \"Be quiet and listen.\" Andrews: Precisely! I couldn't have said it better myself. Phoenix: Unnngh...Andrews: I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, it was a \"mess\"? Are you sure it wasn't messy because of your fight with Mr. Corrida...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I understand your frustrations at not being able to prove your theory. However... Before you go accusing people of crimes, go find yourself some evidence! Phoenix: (Grr...) Edgeworth: And then, what did you see next, witness?Andrews: And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Slumped over? Andrews: Yes, he was just sitting there with his head tilted forward, eyes closed. He really looked like he was sleeping. Phoenix: (...Is it just me or did that right there sound a little... odd?)Andrews: When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then what did cross your mind? Andrews: I thought maybe he had smashed everything up in anger because he lost the Grand Prix. And then felt tired after his rampage, so he decided to take a nap... Anyways, that's what I thought... Judge: I see. So you didn't think he was dead at all.Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"Andrews: To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You thought he fainted...? Andrews: I thought he was asleep at first. But then, the room was in such a messy state... I thought maybe he had gotten into a fight with someone... Edgeworth: And that's when you went to pour the glass of juice? Andrews: Yes. He always has a hard time waking up. So Juan always has a glass of tomato juice to drink. Judge: Hmm... I see. And after that, what happened next?Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"Andrews: When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how did you come to realize that he was, in fact, dead? Andrews: I shook him over and over, but I never got a response... So I set the glass down on the dresser and tried to take his pulse. I... I was shocked... and staggered backward... Edgeworth: And knocked the flower vase over. So that's what happened. Andrews: ...Yes.Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"Mia: ... This is what it all comes down to.Phoenix: Huh?Mia: This is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case!Phoenix: (Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews...

    "response_json": {
      "evidence": 9,

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies here. The testimonies are from Adrian Andrews about when she found the body. Let me go through each testimony and check against the evidence.\n\nTestimony 0: She says she didn't pour the juice for herself. The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has her fingerprints, but she claims she poured it for Juan. Maybe that's a point, but she could have handled the glass while pouring for him, so maybe not a direct contradiction.\n\nTestimony 1: She was surprised by the messy state. The Crime Photo (9) shows the messy room, but that's consistent. No issue here.\n\nTestimony 2: Juan was slumped over, looking tired. The Autopsy Report (14) says he was strangled. If he was slumped, maybe there's a contradiction here. Wait, strangulation would leave marks, but if he was just slumped, maybe she didn't notice the scarf? Hmm, not sure.\n\nTestimony 3: She didn't think he was dead. The Autopsy Report (14) states cause of death as strangulation. If he was strangled, there should be visible signs like a scarf around his neck. The Crime Photo (9) shows the victim with a scarf (bandana) around his neck. If Andrews approached him and tried to pour juice, she should have noticed the scarf and realized he was dead. So her claim that she thought he was just fainted or asleep contradicts the visible evidence of the scarf around his neck, which is part of the cause of death. The Crime Photo (9) shows the bandana/scarf, which should have been noticeable.\n\nTestimony 4: She thought he fainted and poured juice. But the Crime Photo shows the knife in his chest, which she should have seen if she got close. Wait, but the knife was added post-mortem. However, the scarf (bandana) around the neck would still be there. If she approached him to pour juice, she should have seen the scarf, indicating he was strangled. Therefore, her testimony that she didn't realize he was dead contradicts the physical evidence of the scarf around his neck, which is visible in the Crime Photo (9).\n\nSo the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (she didn't think he was dead) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) showing the scarf around his neck, which is part of the cause of death. If he was strangled, the scarf would be there, and she should have noticed that he was dead upon approaching him."

Phoenix: Aww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out! Maya: Really...? Edgeworth: W-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart... Phoenix: Oh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!) Judge: Court is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness. Karma: Yes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand? Karma: Lotta Hart, you are a research student at a university? Lotta: That I am. Karma: Good. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand? Lotta: ... Y'all need to learn some manners. Karma: UNDERSTAND? Lotta: Y-yeah, I understand, I understand! Judge: Er... very well. Your testimony, please. Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon. I was in my car. I heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake. When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat. Then there was another \"bang\"... There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat. Karma: Enough. Lotta: Huh? Karma: Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence. Judge: W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately! Karma: As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!! Judge: Order! Order! Order...! I will have order! Karma: ... Well, Judge? Judge: The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant... Phoenix: Phoenix: W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet! Karma: A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!? Phoenix: ...! Karma: Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court! Maya: Uh, Nick... contempt...? Phoenix: \"Contempt of court,\" you know? Maya: I... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony? I think there was Phoenix: I... think I noticed one little thing... Maya: Wow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on! Phoenix: Y-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Leads to: \"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\" I think there wasn't Phoenix: Honestly, I found nothing. Maya: I dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything! Phoenix: I bet von Karma probably fed her her lines. Maya: But... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will... Phoenix: He'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty. Maya: I guess we'll just have to bluff it. Phoenix: But if we mess up... contempt of court. Maya: Hey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt! Phoenix: Er... right. Leads to: \"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\" Phoenix: I understand... I will cross-examine the witness! Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Very well! Judge: I pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Just after midnight,\" you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day! Lotta: Huh? Uh, yeah, well, yes. Karma: Karma: I know you want to find contradictions, but really! Phoenix: Mmmph. Judge: I hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial. Lotta: I was in my car. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why were you camping there, anyway? Lotta: I'm a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research. Phoenix: (What research? This all sounds suspicious...) Press further Phoenix: Ms. Hart. Could you be more specific about your \"research\"? Karma: Karma: What does the witness's motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer \"is nothing\"! I object to this line of questioning! Objection sustained! Judge: W-w-wait, now, I'm the one who says that! Karma: Well, then say it already! Judge: Objection sustained. Phoenix: (Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...) Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (I think I'll let that one slide for now.) Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: I heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you weren't looking at the lake at that time? Lotta: Nope. I looked after I heard that noise. Karma: Karma: She's said that already! I asked you to find \"contradictions\"! Not leisurely chat with the witness! Phoenix: (Urk...) Lotta: When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Could you clearly see the two men? Lotta: Just look at the picture! Clear enough for you? Phoenix: (Uh oh...) Press further Phoenix: Wait a second! I wasn't asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men! Lotta: Uh, yeah, well, of course... Karma: Karma: The witness has testified that she saw them! There's also a photo! You'd best look elsewhere for your precious contradictions! Phoenix: (He jumped in quick... He's hiding something!) Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (I think I'd best let that one slide...) Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: Then there was another \"bang\"... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Were you watching the very moment the shot rang out? Lotta: Well, yeah, sure... Karma: Karma: You're asking meaningless questions! Meaningless! \"Contradictions,\" Mr. Wright. Not meaningless babble! Phoenix: (von Karma, I think I hate you. He's trying to keep me from talking to the witness... To what end...?) Lotta: There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure about that? Lotta: Yeah, sure as a country gal can be! Phoenix: (That sounds pretty sure.) Press further Phoenix: How come you're so sure? Lotta: Well, heck, I scanned the whole lake. Phoenix: (\"Scanned the whole lake\"? It almost sounds like she was more interested in the lake than the boat...) Ms. Hart... you-- Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! The witness has answered the question in full. Phoenix: Mmph! Karma: No need for further questions! Objection sustained! Judge: U-uh, that's what I'm... Karma: Sustained! Judge: Y-yes, of course. Phoenix: (Oh great... What am I supposed to do now?) Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (Lotta seems pretty sure of herself. I'd better not forge blindly ahead here. Still... this whole thing stinks.) Leads back to cross-examination Phoenix: (Th-there weren't any contradictions in there!) Maya: Sorry, Nick. If only my sister were here... Phoenix: (Maya's really taking this hard.) After selecting \"Press further\" upon pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements, and pressing fifth statement: Judge: Enough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting. Phoenix: B-but, Your Honor! Karma: You keep your promise! Judge: Mr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court! Karma: And if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...? Phoenix: Uh... uh huh. Maya: Nick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy! Phoenix: I... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do? Judge: I believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision. Karma: Then, pass your judgment! Judge: Very well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand. ???: Judge: Wh-who was that!? Maya: It... was me. Phoenix: (Maya!) Judge: I-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities? Maya: No, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death! Lotta: ...! Maya: Lotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!? Judge: You will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst! Maya: Answer me, Lotta! Lotta: What's the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth... Karma: Karma: Enough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court! Judge: Y-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave. Phoenix: (No... No...!) Wait! Maya: I-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent! Karma: Hah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Wrong Phoenix: Wrong! Karma: What!? Leads to: \"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\" Right Phoenix: (Dammit, he's right...) Maya: N-Nick! There must be something we can do! Phoenix: I... don't think there is. The cross-examination is over already! Maya: B-but... but didn't Lotta just say she saw him? She did, Nick! She just said that she saw Mr. Edgeworth! She didn't say that in her testimony, did she? Phoenix: ...! Y-you're right! Your Honor! Leads to: \"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\" Phoenix: Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Karma: You're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection! Judge: ... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot. Karma: What!? Judge: Ms. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again. Karma: B-but he is in contempt of court! Maya: No, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me! Judge: Hmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately. Maya: Nick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck! Phoenix: M-Maya...! Karma: Peh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses! Phoenix: (I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...) Judge: Mr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination! Cross Examination -- That Last Statement -- Lotta: I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, what about the other man? Karma: Karma: You cannot expect to be allowed to blithely ignore your promise, Mr. Wright! I believe you claimed there was a contradiction in the witness's testimony! Well, find it! If you can! Judge: Mr. Wright, I have to assign you a penalty. Phoenix: (Damn...!) Present Lake Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Got you.\" Phoenix: (That's it...? Uh oh. I don't know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?) Phoenix: Got you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally! Lotta: Wh-what!? You got what? Phoenix: Look at this photograph. Lotta: The photo I took...? Phoenix: The very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart. Lotta: So... so? Phoenix: This picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!? Lotta: Whut!? Wha--! Judge: Mr. Wright has a point! Karma: Karma: That's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please! Phoenix: Yet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself! Judge: Ms. Hart. Lotta: What! Judge: Could you see the defendant that night? Lotta: O-of course! I said I could and I meant I could! Judge: Then, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting. Phoenix: (I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!) Witness Testimony -- How Edgeworth Was Seen -- Lotta: Yer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits. So, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car. Still, I brought my binoculars with me. When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars. See? No problem! Judge: Hmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (This one'd better be good!) Cross Examination -- How Edgeworth Was Seen -- Lotta: Yer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So? How could you see Edgeworth!? Lotta: Now, just hold your horses for a second! You hasty Yankee types'd never find a gal where I'm from. Judge: Defense attorneys have trouble with that as it is. Phoenix: (Nobody loves me...) Lotta: So, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Your \"camera\"...? Lotta: Yeah. It's got an automatic... Karma: Karma: The issue we are concerned with here is Ms. Hart seeing Mr. Edgeworth! The camera has nothing to do with this at all! Judge: Objection sustained. Phoenix: (Argh! He's not letting her answer any of my questions!) Lotta: Still, I brought my binoculars with me. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Binoculars\"? Lotta: Yeah, binoculars. Phoenix: Yesterday, you mentioned that you were out looking for shooting stars, correct? Lotta: Well... yeah. Phoenix: Wouldn't you need a telescope, not binoculars, for that? Lotta: ...! Phoenix: I've got doubts about your camera, too! Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers? Karma: Karma: The camera is irrelevant to this case! Phoenix: You can't say that for certain! Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright. Is the camera really relevant to this case? If you believe it is, you may continue with this line of questioning. Karma: But know this! If you find nothing with this, there will be consequences! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Do you wish to press further about the camera? Press further Phoenix: (This is make-it-or-break-it time!) The camera is of utmost importance, Your Honor. It is, perhaps, the key to this entire case! Therefore, I will continue my line of questioning! (Wow! Maybe I went a little overboard there...) Judge: Very well! Ms. Hart! You will testify to the court about the camera! Lotta: Yeah, yeah, I hear ya. Changes statement from \"Still, I brought my binoculars with me.\" to \"The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.\" Hold back Phoenix: Okay, Your Honor... I withdraw my question. (I have to remember who I'm dealing with! I bet von Karma wants to trap me so he can put me in contempt! I think I'll hang back for now and see what happens.) Karma: Hah! Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Hart. What made you choose that lake to photograph meteors? You know the fog gets thick on that lake. It's not very suited to stargazing. Lotta: Yeah, well... Y'see, I... I guess I wasn't thinking too straight! Har! Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness because of her challenged intellect! Lotta: Now wait a minute! Karma: Continue your testimony. You were saying how it was that you saw Edgeworth? Lotta: Grr... Karma: No unnecessary comments, please. Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Phoenix: You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie! Lotta: S-says who!? Phoenix: I saw the camera you set up yesterday. It was pointed directly at the lake! You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! Leads to: \"Ooof!\" Present Lake Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie! Lotta: S-says who!? Phoenix: Take a look at this photograph. This was taken on an automatic setting, was it not? Lotta: Y-yeah, that's right. Phoenix: You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! But, as this photograph clearly shows... The camera was pointed directly at the lake! Leads to: \"Ooof!\" Lotta: When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: If there was a heavy fog, how would binoculars change that at all? Lotta: What do you mean? Phoenix: Even binoculars can't see through fog! But... you say you clearly saw him? Lotta: Er... I did... yeah. Karma: Enough! There is no room for doubt in her testimony! Phoenix: (Hmm. She sounded pretty doubtful to me! But... I have to find a clear contradiction first.) Phoenix: (I don't care how many von Karmic objections I get... I'm going to find a hole in this testimony if it's the last thing I do!) Lotta: Ooof! Judge: Mr. Wright! What are you driving at? Phoenix: The witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor! Lotta: ...! Judge: W-well then, what exactly was she photographing? Show evidence Leads to: \"Your Honor! Take a look at this...\" I don't know Phoenix: Well... that I don't know. Karma: Karma: What the witness takes photos of is entirely her business! This has nothing to do with the case! Not to mention that you can't even show us another reason why she might have been there. Mr. Wright... If you are out of material, I suggest we end this mockery of a cross-examination. Phoenix: (Uh oh... I can't let the trial end like this! I have to show them something!) Leads to: \"Your Honor! Take a look at this...\" Phoenix: Your Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake? Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Your Honor? What do you think? Judge: I... think I'm confused. Karma: Wrong again, Mr. Wright. So very wrong. You can't get through this one with your weak bluffs! Phoenix: Y-Your Honor! Enough playing around! Here's the real evidence! Judge: \"Enough playing around\" is my line, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Uh... Leads back to: \"What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?\" Phoenix: Ms. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph! Judge: What's this? A newspaper article? \"Gourdy\"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake... Phoenix: Well, Ms. Hart? Lotta: I... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this \"Gourdy.\" I don't have proof Phoenix: Well, I don't have proof... Karma: Karma: Bah! Your ineptitude is entertaining, Mr. Wright, but enough is enough! I've had enough of baseless claims made without a hair of evidence to support them! Phoenix: Phoenix: Well all right, if that's how you want to play... I'll show you evidence! Judge: Mr. Wright! Are you sure about this? Phoenix: (I'm sure sick of that smarmy prosecutor putting me down! Or... did he taunt me so I'd get mad and make a mistake?) Leads to: \"Very well, let's see it.\" I have proof Phoenix: I have it! Proof! Judge: Hmm... Intriguing! Leads to: \"Very well, let's see it.\" Judge: Very well, let's see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster! Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Phoenix: The proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera! Lotta: ...! Phoenix: You camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake. Lotta: ... Phoenix: And here, this article about \"Gourdy.\" According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren't you! That's why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises! Leads to: \"Order! Order!\" Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Phoenix: The proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster! Lotta: ...! Phoenix: According to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that's how you got this picture when the pistol fired! Leads to: \"Order! Order!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here's my proof! It's simple! Judge: ... If it's simple... then why have you obviously made an error, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Urk...? Lotta: What's that!? Karma: Go home. Consider a career change. Phoenix: (Gah! How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.) Judge: Luckily for you, I'm in a patient mood, Mr. Wright. One more time please. Leads back to: \"Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!\" Judge: Order! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange. Phoenix: (Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you? Lotta: ... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what? Phoenix: Huh...? Lotta: That don't change what I saw, does it? Karma: Exactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist! Lotta: H-hey! Karma: But, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing! Phoenix: (Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!) Judge: Ms. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony. Lotta: ... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though. Phoenix: (Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!) Karma: ... Witness Testimony -- Lotta's New Testimony -- Lotta: Actually, I'm not a research student at a university. I'm an investigative photographer. Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster! That's why I was camping out by the lake. But, that's all I was hiding. When I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake. There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time. Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot. I was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry. Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness. Karma: Karma: The witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination! Judge: Er... hmm. Phoenix: Phoenix: I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?) Judge: Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind. Karma: Hah! That would be a first! Phoenix: (Hah hah, very funny.) Judge: You understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- Lotta's New Testimony -- Lotta: Actually, I'm not a research student at a university. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then what manner of person are you!? Lotta: I'm not sure I'm high-falutin' enough to be called a \"manner\" of anything. Lotta: I'm an investigative photographer. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: An \"investigative photographer\"? Lotta: Yep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It's that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister's graduation last year... N' guess what! Phoenix: Umm... what? Lotta: There was a yoofoh just a' hanging in the sky! Phoenix: A \"yoofoh\"...? Lotta: You know, an \"Unidentified Flying Object\"? A yoofoh! That's when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer! Phoenix: I... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...) Lotta: Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is \"Gourdy\" really all that newsworthy? Lotta: Heck yeah! They even had him up on the TV! Phoenix: (I'm not sure that appearing on the local news \"rumor of the month\" show qualifies. Last month's show was \"Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill,\" I believe.) Lotta: Hey! They also had a picture of him in the newspaper! For real! Judge: Mr. Wright. This is one fight I do not believe you can win. Let's keep moving, shall we? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Lotta: That's why I was camping out by the lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That's why you put the automatic senior on your camera? Lotta: Yep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a \"bang!\"... Phoenix: It snaps a shot. Lotta: Yep. Phoenix: So, how many pictures has it taken so far? Lotta: The only time the camera triggered was that night. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Lotta: But, that's all I was hiding. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake. Lotta: Heck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake'd be swarmin' with competitors! Phoenix: Competitors...? Lotta: Yeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop! Phoenix: Ah... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth? Lotta: W-well, actually... Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! I'll not have you asking questions with no relevance to this case!!! Phoenix: (Whatever you say, von Karma. I know you told her to keep quiet.) Lotta: When I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Exactly what sort of sound was it? Lotta: Well, I never heard one before so I can't say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot. It was a lot sharper a sound than I would have expected. Phoenix: (Hmmm...) Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart!\" Lotta: There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There wasn't \"much else to look at\"? Lotta: Yep. Phoenix: (I dunno. If she heard a bang... and she thought Gourdy was out there... I kind of doubt she'd waste any time looking at a boat.) Lotta: What? What did I do now? What're you giving me that look for? Phoenix: (Definitely suspicious... Maybe it's time for some evidence...) Karma: Witness! Continue. Lotta: Hold your hushpuppies, pops, I'm getting there. Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart!\" Lotta: Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there nothing on the lake but the boat at that time? Lotta: Huh? Wait, so you're thinking maybe he was shot from some other place? I don't think so, nope. The lake was smooth as glass, and nobody was on the shore, neither. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart!\" Phoenix: (I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!) Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!? Lotta: W-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it! Phoenix: I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal! Lotta: Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!? Phoenix: You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought! Lotta: Aah! Judge: Order! Continue, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing! Lotta: ...! ... ... Phoenix: Well!? Lotta: Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all... Judge: M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then? Lotta: ... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now. Judge: ... This... this is totally uncalled for-- Lotta: B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof! Judge: Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this. Lotta: Right! Right! That's why I took this photo n'... Karma: Karma: Witness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole. Lotta: Sh-shut my what!? Phoenix: (What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...) Gumshoe: She even had a photograph to prove it. Phoenix: But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting. Gumshoe: That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\" Phoenix: (She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?) Make her show the enlargement Leads to: \"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph.\" Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (If this is a trap... I'd better hold back and see how things go. But... if I wait now, the cross-examination will be over! Can I really risk that!?) Do nothing Judge: This hereby ends the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart. Karma: And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time. Judge: Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add? Karma: I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required? Judge: Nothing, of course. Phoenix: (Oh no! I should have pressed further!) Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Game over Rethink position Phoenix: (I have to fight now or I could lose everything!) Leads to: \"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph.\" Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not? Lotta: Y-yeah! I did! Phoenix: Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!? Karma: Karma: B-because it does not exist! Lotta: What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool! Judge: What's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma! Karma: Er... erm... Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement! Karma: Karma: The prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence! Judge: Objection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court. Lotta: Here it is. Judge: Hmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence. Lake Photo added to the Court Record. Karma: Happy now, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Hmm... (There has to be something!) Karma: You asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it! Judge: Hmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination... Karma: Is over! Obviously! Judge: Then, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart. Karma: And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time. Judge: Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add? Karma: I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required? Judge: Nothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict. Phoenix: (Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?) Object to the enlargement Leads to: \"Your Honor!\" Show other evidence Phoenix: W-wait! Your Honor, This evidence... Karma: Karma: I believe we have spent enough time talking about evidence! Judge: Hmm... indeed. We've heard opinions on every piece of evidence but this enlargement. I see no point in retracing our steps. Leads back to: \"This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?\" Wait and see Phoenix: (Uh oh... think of something! No good... I guess I'll just sit back and see how this turns out.) Judge: Very well! Allow me to state my verdict. Phoenix: (Oh no! I should have pressed further!) Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Game over Phoenix: Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement! Judge: W-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is \"strange\"? Phoenix: (Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.) Present shooter's hand or pistol Phoenix: Leads to: \"Here, Your Honor!\" Present shooter Phoenix: Phoenix: Here, your honor! Judge: The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange? Can you be more specific? Phoenix: (Specific, right...) Leads back to: \"I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here, Your Honor! Judge: Where...? Mr. Wright, I understand you're in a tight spot. However! You have nothing to gain by making baseless claims of faulty evidence! Phoenix: Y-Your Honor! Never mind that... my, my finger slipped! Please let me show you again! Judge: Hmm... Leads back to: \"I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.\" Phoenix: Here, Your Honor! Judge: The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange? Phoenix: Look at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor! Judge: The hand...? Phoenix: That hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence! Judge: This man's left hand does what...!? Phoenix: Let me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts! Present Pistol Phoenix: Leads to: \"The evidence is clear.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Hmm... I'm not sure this warrants a \"take that!\" I'd better think this one through!) Judge: Mr. Wright, please hurry up. We haven't got all day. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor! Right away! Leads back to: \"I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!\" Phoenix: The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's \"right hand\"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!! Judge: Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Judge: You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim? Karma: Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!? Ms. Hart Phoenix: Who else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart! Judge: Wh-what!? Do you have proof of this!? Phoenix: (Proof-shmoof! Always with the proof! Oh... wait, I do need proof, don't I.) Judge: Mr. Wright! I'll have you remember this is a court of law! Phoenix: (Uh oh. The Judge is mad.) Karma: Let me ask again! Leads back to: \"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?\" The victim himself Leads to: \"There is only one explanation remaining!\" Larry Phoenix: (Wait, wait--I can't do that. Sacrifice one friend to save another? What's the point!?) Karma: Well, Wright! Your answer! Leads back to: \"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?\" Phoenix: There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!! Judge: Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation. Judge: Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option. Karma: Karma: I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Karma: An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot. Phoenix: The... distance? Karma: The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away! Phoenix: A meter! Th-that's three feet! Karma: There is no way it could have been suicide! Judge: Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!? Karma: Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see. Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Karma: ... Judge: That is all. The court is adjourned. December 26, 1:15 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2 Phoenix: Whew, that was a close one. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Hey! Don't you have anything to say!? Edgeworth: No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright. Phoenix: Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too! Edgeworth: ... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him! Phoenix: I was just kidding around. Edgeworth: Hmph. Phoenix: Look... I'm going to go check on Maya. Edgeworth: Oh... Wright. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Tell her something for me. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: ... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all. Phoenix: (Would it kill you to just state how you really feel with a \"thanks\", Edgeworth?) (Changed from [Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!] in the original release) Phoenix: I requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the \"bang\" she heard. Lotta's Deposition added to the Court Record. To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Goodbyes Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 December 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Maya! Maya: Hey! Nick, it's you! I'm glad Mr. Edgeworth made it through the day okay. It's a relief... Phoenix: Hey. Why'd you do that, anyway? Maya: ... I don't know. I... just knew I had to do something. I know I'm not the lawyer my sister was... ... I'm sorry. Phoenix: Well, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay? Maya: O... Okay. Talk Questioning Phoenix: Have you been questioned yet? Maya: No... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said \"seeing as this is your first offense, we'll let you go after questioning.\" Phoenix: Whew... Maya: Oh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay? Phoenix: Huh? How much? Maya: I don't know. I guess they'll send you a bill or something. Phoenix: (Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word \"bail\"?) Mia Phoenix: Any luck with Mia...? Maya: None... I can't get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don't know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn't have stopped my training. Phoenix: (Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...) Maya: I wonder if I'll ever see my sister again... Present Attorney's Badge Maya: It must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say \"I'm a lawyer!\" But, spirit mediums, well... Phoenix: I dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you... Maya: But these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I'll ever be a proper medium... Lake Photo Maya: Isn't that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about? Phoenix: Uh huh. Maya: Huh... It's nice and big... but you can't really see the faces any clearer, can you? Misty Fey's Photo Maya: My... mother. ... Phoenix: (Now that I've shown her the picture, I'm not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I'm pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.) Gourdy Article Maya: I want to see Gourdy, too! Phoenix: If he really exists. Maya: Well, I'd say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let's get some fishing poles and go down to the lake! Phoenix: (Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...) Pistol Bullet Maya: So the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched? Phoenix: Hey, I'm surprised you remembered that! Maya: How could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings? Phoenix: I'm... not really sure. Pistol Maya: Mr. Edgeworth's prints are on this pistol, aren't they? Phoenix: Yes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting. Maya: What? Really!? Phoenix: (The shooter used his left hand, after all...) Anything else Maya: Sorry... I'm fresh out of ideas. December 26Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: ... Sure is quiet here with nobody around. Right... I have to get Maya out of that detention cell soon! December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe's not here...) Police: Gumshoe's at the scene again today. Phoenix: Huh? Oh, really? Police: He's a live wire that one. Got into a fight with the chief for not following protocol... Phoenix: (Not following protocol...? I bet he wouldn't help them build the case against Edgeworth...) Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"Don't do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: Wha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don't believe it! Phoenix: (He must be playing chess on the computer...) December 26Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: Apparently, Mr. Grossberg is on vacation today. Well, I guess I can come back tomorrow if I need anything. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read. Desk Phoenix: A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster. Vacant wall Phoenix: I guess Mr. Grossberg isn't getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him... Potted plant Phoenix: An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available. Table Phoenix: A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn. December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrance Phoenix: There are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today? Examine Trees Phoenix: I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a \"nature park.\" It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold. Sign Phoenix: The sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though. December 26Gourd LakePublic Beach Phoenix: Haven't seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance... Examine Lake Phoenix: The famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It's a pretty big lake, really. December 26Boat Rental Shop Phoenix: (Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.) Examine Shop Phoenix: A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder. Boats Phoenix: There are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock. December 26Gourd Lake Woods Phoenix: Hey, Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ... Phoenix: Yes? What about the trial? Gumshoe: Well, I was going to say \"good show,\" but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know? Phoenix: Er... thanks. Examine Camera Phoenix: Lotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen. Sign Phoenix: The sign says \"No Camping.\" Funny place to pick to pitch your tent. Campfire Phoenix: I wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit. SUV Phoenix: I don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here. Talk Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow? Gumshoe: It sounds like he's bringing in another witness! Phoenix: Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today... Karma: There were two witnesses! Phoenix: I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it? Gumshoe: S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information. Phoenix: (Right...) Prosecutor Edgeworth Phoenix: Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth. Gumshoe: What's up? Phoenix: Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before. Gumshoe: ... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident? Gumshoe: Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes. Maya Fey Phoenix: I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey... Gumshoe: Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release) Phoenix: Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?) Gumshoe: He was really grateful for what she did, you know. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: I think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal! Lotta's Camera Gumshoe: That woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all... Phoenix: Still, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today. Gumshoe: Oh, huh, really? Phoenix: (Umm... you were at the trial, weren't you, Detective?) Robert's Autopsy Report Gumshoe: Robert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager. Lake Photo Gumshoe: I don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all! Phoenix: But Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat. Gumshoe: Then he's the one being shot, then! Phoenix: He seemed fine in court today... Gumshoe: ... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway? Phoenix: (All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...) Pistol Bullet Gumshoe: Yep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt. Phoenix: From a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat. Gumshoe: Hmm... Phoenix: What do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Hey, making something of things is your job! Phoenix: Er... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?) Pistol Gumshoe: Maybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal. Phoenix: Huh? How should I know!? Lotta's Deposition Gumshoe: Now, she heard two gunshots, right? Phoenix: But wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times! Gumshoe: What!? How's that possible!? Phoenix: Where was the third shot fired? Gumshoe: I wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something? Anything else Gumshoe: Sorry to disappoint you, pal. I'm drawing a blank. After clearing all Talk options: Gumshoe: I'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can. Phoenix: Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be? Gumshoe: Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth...? Gumshoe: Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay? Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month's rent, too...) After clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake Woods: December 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: Hey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I'm free to go. Phoenix: Free at last, eh? Maya: Those interrogators were really mean! They were like \"okay, what did you do THIS time?\" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it? Phoenix: Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they? Maya: Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail. Phoenix: Thank Edgeworth. Maya: Huh? Phoenix: He posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did. Maya: Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick! Talk What to do Phoenix: What do you think we should do next? Maya: We're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy. Phoenix: ... Maya: I-I was kidding! Phoenix: Still, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there? Maya: Sure! Any ideas Phoenix: Have you noticed anything lately? Maya: Hmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean. Phoenix: I meant have you noticed anything about the case...? Maya: Well... Not much more than that, no. Phoenix: (She's probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.) Wright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great. Phoenix: Behave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay? Maya: Heh heh heh. Misbehaving's much more fun. Phoenix: It's not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again. Maya: ... Right. I'll behave. Phoenix: (Oh dear...) Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: I don't know! I've been in detention this whole time. I think I'll let you decide what we should do. Deal? Any ideas Phoenix: Well? Any thoughts you want to share? Maya: Well, I was detention all day. I think I'd like more time to think. Phoenix: (Poor Maya, she probably thought about Mia the whole time she was in there...) Present Anything Maya: Don't waste time showing me things! We have to get cracking on this case! You know the enemy has more tricks up his sleeve! He's bringing in another witness! December 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like Edgeworth is in questioning. Maya: Let's come back later. Phoenix: Guess so... December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrance Maya: There aren't many cops around today, are there? Phoenix: They're probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth. Maya: Mmm... Lotta: Hey y'all! Maya: Hey, it's Lotta! Lotta: Y'all really did it today... Phoenix: Wh-what did we do now? Lotta: Naw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind. Phoenix: Lotta... Lotta: So, you see, I want to make it up to y'all. Phoenix: \"Make it up\"...? Talk Today's trial Phoenix: What did you think of the trial? Lotta: To be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble. Maya: Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing. Lotta: Yeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder! Maya: Right! Phoenix: (You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...) Gourdy Phoenix: What about Gourdy? Lotta: Right! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom! Maya: All right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too! Phoenix: (Finish your spirit medium training first!) Making it up Phoenix: Lotta, what do you mean by \"making it up to us\"? Lotta: Well, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you. Maya: What!? Lotta: That von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it. Maya: Wh-what information!? Lotta: Now we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little \"exchange.\" Phoenix: E-\"exchange\"? Umm... I thought this was to \"make it up to us\"...? Lotta: Right! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you! Phoenix: ... Lotta: What!? Information don't come cheap, my friend! Maya: Uh... Lotta: Hey! I see you thinking \"my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are\"!!! It's written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I'm just the exception, okay? Well, what'll it be? We gonna deal, or not!? Maya: Wh-what should we do, Nick? Deal Phoenix: (We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much? Lotta: Huh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I'm not trying to rob the poor! Leads to: \"Huh?\" No deal Phoenix: I'm sorry... But I've no intention of dealing with you! Maya: Nor do we have any money, anyway! Lotta: You guys make a fine team, you know that? And I can tell you don't have any money, just look at those clothes! Leads to: \"Huh?\" Present Lotta's Camera Lotta: I'm thinking I should up the sensitivity of my camera mic. Y'all just be sure y'all don't sneeze or nothing when you're in my part of the woods! Phoenix: Right... Lake Photo Lotta: I'm glad I did that enlargement. Phoenix: No kidding. If we didn't have that, Edgeworth would be in prison now, or worse! Maya: There's never a lack of drama when you're on a case, is there, Nick? Lotta: What, are you always on the verge of horrible failure like this!? Phoenix: Umm... Lotta: Careful or the stress'll send you to an early grave. Phoenix: (Thanks for the cheerful message of support!) Gourdy Article Maya: Umm... uh... You know, I was wondering... Lotta: Yeah? Maya: What if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did? Lotta: Y'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn't make a hit story! I need a picture that screams \"I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!\" I can't turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y'all think I am? Phoenix: (The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn't see!) Anything else Lotta: Yep, I'd have to say I know exactly squat about that. Phoenix: (It's painfully easy to know when something doesn't catch Lotta's interest...) Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: The only fair exchange for information is... information! Listen good-- What I need from you is information about Gourdy! Maya: Whoa-whoa-whoa! G-Gourdy!? Phoenix: B-but Gourdy doesn't... I mean, Gourdy might not exist! Lotta: Then bring me proof that shows he don't! Phoenix: Uh... Lotta: I'll be keepin' watch from the car, okay? You see something, y'all come to me first, got it? Phoenix: O-okay... Lotta: Right! See y'all later! Phoenix: ... Maya: Okay, Nick, let's get hunting! Phoenix: H-hunting...? You don't seriously mean... Maya: Gourdy? I sure do! Phoenix: What about Edgeworth!? Maya: We're searching for Gourdy for him, Nick! Don't you get it!? Phoenix: (Okay... and how exactly do we search for a make-believe monster...? Maybe we can find a monster myth specialist?) December 26Gourd LakePublic Beach Phoenix: Wh-what's that? Maya: Th-the Steel Samurai, Nick. Butz: Yo! Maya! Phoenix: Larry! What the heck is that!? (Changed from [Larry! What the heck is this!?] in the original release) Butz: Oh, it was my girl Kiyance's idea... She was all \"if you like, put this here, it would be, like, really cool!\" Dude, she gave it to me along with the banner! Maya: Wow! That's really impressive she could find those for you! Butz: Well, she knows a lot of people. And that show's finished now, so she got 'em for free. Phoenix: Right... Examine Flags Phoenix: Those flags look sadly out of place here. Flapping listlessly back and forth in a cold wind under a cold sky... Maya: I dunno, I think it kind of gives the place a festival atmosphere. It reminds me of the \"War of the Eyeglasses\"! Phoenix: ...? The war of the what!? Maya: Huh? What? You mean, you don't know the War of the Eyeglasses? Phoenix: What the heck is it? Maya: Our local fair used to do it ever summer... Huh, I guess we were the only ones. Phoenix: (I ask again, what the heck is it!?) Steel Samurai inflatable Phoenix: Doesn't that Steel Samurai look a little out of place? I mean, it's so huge... I guess it's good advertising. Maya: ... Something about this Steel Samurai just doesn't work for me. Phoenix: Huh? Really? It looks pretty well made to me. Maya: Hmph. Still a novice, aren't you, Nick. Really... True connoisseurs like Cody and me don't fall for this kind of stuff. Phoenix: (These Steel Samurai fans are obviously in a league of their own...) Compressor Maya: What's this machine? Butz: That? That's a compressor. I use it to fill up that balloon there with air. Maya: Huh, neat. Butz: Just got it repaired yesterday! Man, what a drag that was. Talk Edgeworth Butz: Yo, Nick! What happened with Edgeworth? Phoenix: Well, we made it through the first day in court all right... I don't know how good our prospects are from here on, though. Butz: Huh. Maya: Hey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth's secret weakness? He's terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy! Butz: Huh? That's weird. I don't think he was ever like that in school. Maya: No? Really? Butz: Well, we were only in the same class for a year. He transferred schools pretty quickly... Maya: Transferred? Phoenix: (Right... when the DL-6 Incident happened. Doesn't look like Larry knows about it, though.) The big samurai Phoenix: Hey, Larry. What was that big... thing up there before? Butz: Huh? Oh, the big guy? I've had that for about a month, yeah. It's a big hit with the kids! Phoenix: Why wasn't it there yesterday? Butz: Huh? Huh!? Oh... right. Th-the compressor was busted. Maya: Compressor? Butz: Yeah--it's that little unit by my hotdog stand. That what I use to put air in the Steel Samurai! It broke a little while ago so I sent it in for repairs. Maya: Oh. And here I thought you'd inflated it by yourself. Present Gourdy Article Butz: That's the guy that\u2019s selling my dogs faster than I can cook 'em! Maya: Do you think Gourdy really exists? Butz: Nah, I think somebody probably saw something else that they just thought was Gourdy. But I'll keep selling Samurai Dogs until the truth's out! Anything else Butz: Sorry, Nick. I don't know much about that. I am a mere seller of hotdogs. December 26Boat Rental Shop Maya: ... It\u2019s always so quiet, here. I wonder if the boat shop is closed for good? Phoenix: Well, with the murder on the lake and all... They're probably just taking a vacation till it blows over. Maya: I get it. After clearing \"Making it up\" talk option in Gourd Lake Park - Entrance: December 26Gourd Lake Woods Lotta: Hey y'all! Well? Y'all find anything out about Gourdy? Maya: Umm... no, nothing. Lotta: Well, keep moving! It gets cold out here at nighttime. Maya: It is a little chilly... I... I think I have to sneeze! Lotta: Wh-whoa! No you don't! No sneezing!!! Maya: Whaaa-cho! klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik Maya: ... Lotta: I told y'all NO SNEEZING! See, I set the camera to respond to things a little softer than a \"bang.\" It'd trigger on one of von Karma's finger snaps now! Maya: Oh... I'm sorry. Lotta: Yeah, well, sorry's nice but what about my film!? Maya: Nick... pay the lady. Phoenix: (*sob*) Talk What happened Lotta: I learned something in today's trial, that's for sure. Testifyin' is serious business! That's why I decided not to talk about that case any more. Maya: Huh? Phoenix: Whoa--didn't you say you had information about the case!? Tell us that, at least! Lotta: Like I said... I'll trade it for the dirt on Gourdy! Gourdy Maya: What are you going to do if Gourdy doesn't exist? Lotta: I'll quit being an investigative photographer. Maya: What!? Lotta: After all, I only have one photo to my name so far... Maya: Was it a good one? Lotta: You bet... a yoofoh! Maya: A y-yoofoh...? Lotta: Anyway, if I can't get a career-making photo this time around... Then that's it! I'll quit and go back to school. Maya: Huh? So you really are a university student? Lotta: Yeah, well, I'm takin' a break for a bit. Maya: Right... Present Lotta's Camera Lotta: I gotta do what I gotta do to get me a picture of Gourdy! That's why I raised the sensitivity of my mic. Just... watch yourself from now on, okay? Maya: Sorry, sorry! December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Gumshoe: Hey there, pal. What's up? You look out of sorts. Wait... you didn't go and do something that's going to hurt Mr. Edgeworth's case again! Phoenix: What do you mean, \"again\"!? Gumshoe: Whatever, have a seat, pal. I'm here for you if you need anything. Besides money, that is. Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"You're under arrest! I have a warrant... You have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney...\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for making arrests. Talk The investigation Phoenix: How is the investigation proceeding? Gumshoe: It's not, really. We have another meeting coming up... We're supposed to talk about Mr. Edgeworth's motive... Maya: His motive? Gumshoe: See, Mr. Edgeworth's father died in the DL-6 Incident... And the guy who got the lone suspect declared innocent was the victim in this case... Robert Hammond. They're saying that's why Mr. Edgeworth shot him. Phoenix: (And Edgeworth never talks about his past... I bet they'll drag that out and hit him with it in court tomorrow, too...) Maya: Poor Edgeworth... Gumshoe: I gotta admit, it doesn't look good, pal. Gourdy Maya: Say, Detective Gumshoe. Do you know \"Gourdy\"? Gumshoe: The monster down in Gourd Lake? Not personally, no. Maya: Well... we're looking for it. (Changed from [Well... we're looking for him.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Huh!? Are you out of your minds!? Maya: Eeek! Gumshoe: You got time to go wild monster hunting!? How about doing a little questioning for me then!? Maya: Oh... Detective Gumshoe is scaring me, Nick. Phoenix: I told Detective Gumshoe about the deal with Lotta. Maya: Nick! Try telling him sooner next time! Phoenix: Er, sorry. Gumshoe: ... I see, pal. Sorry for shoutin' at you. ... Okay! I, Detective Gumshoe, will aid your search for Gourdy! Maya: H-huh!? Gumshoe: I'll loan you one of our newest secret weapons for finding evidence! Maya: Really!? Gumshoe: You can take whichever one you like! Changes \"Gourdy\" Talk option to \"Secret weapons\" Secret weapons Maya: Okay, give us the goods! Gumshoe: Hold on now, everything in due time. First, let me show 'em to you! These are our best and brightest! Introducing Secret Weapon No. 1: \"Missile\"! Maya: M-M-Missile? Gumshoe: He's a K-9 police dog, still in training! Missile! Missile! Here, boy... Missile: Woof. Gumshoe: Here he is. Maya: Hey, he's cute! Look, Nick! Cute dog! Phoenix: (A cute dog... And this will help us... how?) Missile: Woof. Gumshoe: Next, Secret Weapon No. 2... A fishing pole! Here, this is my own personal pole. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for a monster... Gumshoe: Yeah! Phoenix: How are we supposed to catch a whole sea monster with a fishing pole!? Gumshoe: Never know 'til you try, pal! Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: Okay, this next one is the last one. Phoenix: (No, please, I'm already overwhelmed by our choices.) Gumshoe: Secret Weapon No. 3! A metal detector! Here. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for something alive. Gumshoe: Right! Phoenix: How are we supposed to find it with a metal detector!? Gumshoe: Hey, you never know! It might have been eating soda cans! Well, which will it be!? Maya: Umm... I can't make up my mind, Nick. They all seem so perfect! Phoenix: I can't make up my mind, either... for the totally opposite reason. (Oh well, I suppose it can't hurt to borrow one of them.) Borrow Missile Phoenix: Can we borrow Missile? Gumshoe: Sure thing, pal. Be good to 'im! Missile: Woof. Maya: He's sooooo cute! Phoenix: (Oh boy...) Borrowed K-9 unit Missile from Detective Gumshoe.

But I hear he's aptly-named, for what it's worth. Fishing Pole Gumshoe: It's funny, one day I woke up and I wanted a fishing pole. Maya: Do you like fishing? Gumshoe: I've never gone. I just wanted one so bad, I went out and bought it. I've never used it, actually. Phoenix: (Must have been one of those mid-life crisis things...) Metal Detector Gumshoe: As you can see, it's a metal detector. We use it to look for bullets in the ground. If you can find that monster with it, all the better! Phoenix: (I'm not so hopeful...) Gourd Lake Public Beach If Missile is added to the Court Record Maya: Hey, Nick... Phoenix: Hmm? Maya: Missile's been acting strangely... Phoenix: \"Missile\"? Oh, oh right. That little... creature of yours. Butz: Hey, I love lil' doggies! Good boy, good boy. Missile: Grrraaaaaaarh! Maya: Wh-what's wrong, Missile? Missile: ...

(It's going to have to this time...) Present Missile Maya: Hey Larry! Look, it's Missile! Isn't he cute? Butz: K-keep that mutt away from me! What am I going to tell the big boss? Maya: There's a \"big boss\" in charge of your hot dog stand? Nick! Maybe the stand is a front for a mafia money laundering scheme!!! Phoenix: Maya... I think you should probably try to look a little sorry about what happened. Maya: Oh, right! Butz: Heh... My poor dogs... Fishing Pole Butz: You know, you can't catch many fish in this lake. Maya: I'm not after small fry. I'm after the biggest fry of them all... Gourdy! Butz: ... You really going to try to fish out a monster? Maya: To save Edgeworth, yes! Butz: ... Brings a tear to my eye, in more ways than one. Gourd Lake Woods If Fishing Pole is added to the Court Record Maya: Mmm. Okay, Nick, this looks like a good spot! Phoenix: A good spot... for what? Maya: Time to do some fishing! Phoenix: (She's serious...) Umm... What are you going to use for bait? Maya: Oh... Phoenix: Yeah. \"Oh.\" Maya: Mmm... Phoenix: I figured something like this would happen. We should have brought Missile along with us, too. At least then we'd have bait. Maya: ...!!! N-Nick...! How could you! Phoenix: I'm kidding! I'm kidding! Maya: Hmph! Some jokes are better left untold. Phoenix: (Oof! She hit me!) Maya: Okay... Watch this, Nick! Phoenix: Just try not to reel in any empty cans or boots, okay?

His name's \"Missile.\" Lotta: Huh. K-9s are the ones they use to sniff for things, right? I wonder what Gourdy smells like... Maya: Hmm... I hadn't thought about that. Fishing Pole Maya: Lotta, wait... For catching Gourdy... Lotta: A fishing pole!? Are you out of your doggone mind!? Maya: Yes! I mean... yes, it's a fishing pole! Lotta: Huh. I never thought of that! Good luck! Maya: Thanks! Phoenix: (I don't believe it...) Metal Detector Maya: Hey, Lotta, look at this: It's a metal detector! Lotta: I know what it is. Umm... I'm not sure that's going to pick up Gourdy, though. Unless he's been eating people's watches or spare change or something. Maya: Oh... I hadn't thought about that. Boat Rental Shop If Metal Detector is added to the Court Record *beep* *beep* *beep* Maya: N-Nick! It's beeping! The metal detector's found something! Phoenix: Sure it loud enough about it. (Whatever it is, it must be in those bushes...) Go check it out, Maya. Maya: Why do I have to check it out? ... Nick. Look! Phoenix: Huh...? An air tank? Huh. The valve looks broken. Maya: I thought it was Gourdy... Phoenix: Maya, first of all... Why would Gourdy be in the bushes!? And second of all, why would a metal detector react to a sea monster!? Maya: Oh. Phoenix: Huh? (There's something wrapped around this air tank... It looks like... a string of flags...?) Maya: Well, we might as well take it with us now that we've found it. Phoenix: (It's heavy...) Air Tank of dubious value retrieved. (Changed from [Picked up air tank of dubious value.] in the original release) After Air Tank is added to the Court Record: December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Phoenix: Hmm... Detective Gumshoe isn't here... Maya: Now that you mention it, didn't he say he had a meeting to go to? Phoenix: Ah, that's right... Let's come back later. Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"Resistance is futile! We have you surrounded! It's not too late... Release the hostages and come out with your hands up.\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for negotiating a hostage situation. Gourd Lake Public Beach Talk The flying air tank (after selecting \"Is it yours?\", then \"To inflate something\", then \"Ask more about the tank\" upon presenting Air Tank) Maya: Umm... So, the tank and the Steel Samurai you were trying to fill up flew away... What happened next? Butz: Well, all that happened on the 20th or so. Phoenix: (The 20th... a week ago.) Butz: Now, as far as I could see, the tank went flying out into the lake. So I went out every night in a boat looking for it. I mean, Kiyance gave me that Steel Samurai after all! Maya: And when did you find it? Butz: Just the night before last! It flew way out there! Took me four whole days to find it. Phoenix: (The night before last... was the night of the murder!) Butz: Sorry for not telling you, Nick. Actually, I was here on the night of the murder. But, you see, I went home before midnight. Maya: So you didn't know about what happened? Butz: No... Maya: That's too bad... Phoenix: It's not all bad. We've solved one mystery at least. Maya: A mystery...? Phoenix: (Maybe we should go tell her...) Present Air Tank Butz: What? An air tank? What about it? Phoenix: Larry... I wanted to ask you about this tank... Have you seen it before? Phoenix: Have you seen this before? Butz: Huh? Me? N-no. Never. Who the heck would go diving in the middle of the winter! Phoenix: (There's something about the way his eye twitched when I showed him the tank... I think I'd better pursue this line of questioning a little further...) Leads back to Court Record Is it yours? Phoenix: Say... is this air tank yours? Butz: Wh-why would I have a thing like that? Phoenix: Look--see how there's a string of flags around the tank valve? It's just like the string of flags around your Steel Samurai there. Butz: ...! M-must be a coincidence! There's strings of flags everywhere these days! L-like elementary schools! A-and used car dealerships! L-look, why would I need a tank anyway!? To inflate something Phoenix: You used this to inflate that, didn't you? Butz: I-inflate what!? Phoenix: What else? That big puffy Steel Samurai! Butz: !!! ... N-now why would you go asking me a question like that. Phoenix: (Looks like I hit the nail on the head.) Butz: ... Right... right... Actually, umm... See, the compressor I always use was on the fritz. So I tried using the tank to inflate it, just once. And, er, it didn't go so well. Phoenix: (As I suspected!) Put the tank away Phoenix: (I guess I've gotten to the bottom of that mystery!) Butz: Heh. Sorry! Leads back to Court Record Ask more about the tank Phoenix: It \"didn't go so well\"? Butz: Er, yeah. Phoenix: Do you think you could be a little more specific? Butz: C-c'mon...  Look, it's embarrassing so I really don't want to talk about it... Maya: Tell us! Tell us! Butz: ... Fine. Whatever. It's like what I said, the compressor was busted. So I took the tank and tried to fill the Samurai up with that. And then... BLAAAAM! Butz: The valve busted open and made this incredible noise! And that tank there took off like a rocket. And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it! Maya: What!? Off into Gourd Lake? Butz: It sure scared me out of my gourd, that's for sure. Adds Talk option \"The flying air tank\" To go diving Phoenix: You used this to go diving in the lake, didn't you? Butz: Wh-wh-what!? Why the heck would I go diving in the lake!? Wait! You... you're not... You're not saying I had something to do with that murder!? Phoenix: N-no, not at all, just... Butz: Hey, you watch it buddy! I'm not saying anything until my lawyer gets here! Maya: Larry... Nick is your lawyer. Phoenix: Well, Larry? She's right. Butz: Bah! A-anyway, I never seen that air tank! Okay? Phoenix: (Yeah, right... Larry is hiding something, I can tell...) Leads back to Court Record Air Tank (after selecting \"Is it yours?\", then \"To inflate something\", then \"Ask more about the tank\" upon presenting Air Tank) Butz: See, I tried to use this tank to fill up the Samurai. I was attaching the tank, when it happened! BLAAAAM! Butz: The valve just busted open and the whole thing took off! The tank shot up in the air like a rocket... And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it! Man, what a sight that was. Maya: I wish I could have seen it! Phoenix: Me too. Gourd Lake Woods Talk Gourdy Lotta: Well, Mister Lawyer? I've got the info y'all need! Y'all got the scoop on Gourdy for me yet? Nothing yet Phoenix: It's not going to be that easy to find him, you know. Lotta: You'd better hurry or you won't have that info in time for the trial tomorrow! Phoenix: (Uh oh...) Leads back to Talk options We found him Phoenix: Huh? Gourdy? Oh, we found him already. Maya: What!? I haven't seen any monsters yet! Lotta: Y-y'all for real!? Gourdy really exists!? Wait! I need proof! You get a photo!? I have proof Phoenix: Of course I have proof. Maya: No fair, Nick! It was when I went to the bathroom, wasn't it!? That's when you made contact with Gourdy! Lotta: Enough jabbering already, let's see your proof!

Phoenix: This... is Gourdy. Lotta: Umm... scuze me? Maya: Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick? Phoenix: There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud \"bang\" when it flew... Lotta: A \"bang\"...? Phoenix: The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo! Maya: Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!? Lotta: ... ... Well, that's a fine way to ruin a gal's dreams. Phoenix: I'm sorry, Lotta. Lotta: Nah, it's okay, you win. I'll give you your info, like I promised. Maya: Poor Lotta...

Lotta: Y'all got some proof Gourdy don't exist!? Phoenix: The proof that Gourdy doesn't exist... Is here Phoenix: Of course I have proof.

Maya: Boat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted. Lotta: Just an old guy, living all by himself. Y'all should go check it out. Maya: Thanks, Lotta! We will! Let's get cracking, Nick! Lotta: Hold on. Phoenix: Something else? Lotta: Yeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know. Maya: ...! Wait... so you have another photo? Lotta: Well... Yeah, but there's nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn't be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it. Second Lake Photo added to the Court Record. Lotta: Bye now. Y'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave. Maya: ... Poor Lotta... Phoenix: It's all Larry's fault.

Uncle: You'll run the pasta shop when I'm gone? Maya: P-pasta? Uncle: Glad to hear it, glad to hear it! You make your old man proud. When you kids left the house, I didn't know what to think. How'm I supposed to keep this place running, an old man like me? Polly! The kids are home! Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Maya: N-Nick! What was that!? Phoenix: A parrot... the one on the perch. Uncle: Keith! Phoenix: Y-yes!? Uncle: I leave the \"Wet Noodle\" in your capable hands, sonny. Maya: N-Nick? What's the \"Wet Noodle\"? Phoenix: Um, based on the available evidence, I'd say it's the name of his pasta shop. Uncle: That's a relief, isn't it, Polly? Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Uncle: Ayup... ... *Zzzzz* Maya: He fell asleep... Phoenix: I guess he's relieved. Examine Stove Phoenix: Looks like a kitchen unit. It's pretty clean. Funny, he doesn't look like the type who'd keep things tidy like that. Maya: You're forgetting, Nick... He's running a pasta shop, here! Fish pictures Phoenix: Wow, there's lots of various fish in Gourd Lake, aren't there! Maya: ...? Something's funny, Nick. All these fish are saltwater fish. Fishing pole Phoenix: This fishing pole looks expensive. Table Maya: Look, Nick, he has an electric blanket on his table! Looks warm! That's a great idea, we should do that at the office. We can sit down with our clients, snug and warm, and drink hot cocoa! Phoenix: And what, talk about murders? Maya: Aw, you're a party pooper, Nick! Television Maya: Wow, he has a television in here, too. Safe Maya: Look, a little safe! Hmm... ... It's locked. Parrot Maya: Wow... what an amazing parrot that is. Good morning!

To think, the \"Wet Noodle,\" will live on when I'm gone! My father started it you know. So that makes you two the third generation! Meg... Maya: Y-yes! Uncle: Tomorrow, we'll start with the secrets of dough tossin'! Maya: D-dough tossing? Uncle: You, too, Keith. Phoenix: Y-yes? Uncle: You'll be the best pasta wrangler the west has ever seen! Maya: P-pasta wrangler? The west? I-isn't pasta from Italy? Uncle: Meg! Maya: Y-yes! Uncle: You know the best pasta's always been made west of the Rockies, don't you? Phoenix: R-right, of course. Everybody knows that. Maya: Nick...? Phoenix: Huh? Maya: How long do we have to keep up this all-in-the-family charade? Phoenix: (This old man must know something about the murder...! We're not leaving until we find out what that is.) The pasta restaurant (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: Umm... a pasta shop? Uncle: Ayup!

We're not leaving until we find out what that is.) The boat rental shop Uncle: *Zzzzz* Phoenix: Umm... this is a boat rental shop, right? Uncle: What're you talking about!? This here's the palace of pasta, the \"Wet Noodle\"! Though, now that you mention it, we haven't gotten many orders for spaghetti lately. All the kids come up and say \"Yo dude, we wanna ride in one of your boats!\" That's why I keep them boats out there. Youngsters these days... Darned if I understand 'em! Phoenix: I'm pretty confused myself. Maya: Nick... This isn't going anywhere. Phoenix: But this old man is the witness tomorrow, right? We've got to find some way of getting information out of him!

Polly (appears after examining parrot) Uncle: *Zzzzz* Ack, my memory's gotten worse of late. That's why I just tell everything important to old Polly here. Maya: Everything... important? Hmm, I wonder... Polly! What's the number to the safe!? Parrot: \"... 1228!\" *squawk* Maya: Alright! Uncle: H-hey! Polly! Watch it, will ya! Maya: Heh heh. See, Nick? All it takes is a little clever thinking! Phoenix: (And a criminal mind...) Maya: Quick, Nick! Write that number down! Phoenix: H-hey! Don't get me involved in your little heist schemes. Polly (appears after examining parrot; after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: Ack, my memory's gotten worse of late. That's why I just tell everything important to old Polly here. Maya: Everything... important? Hmm, I wonder... Polly! What's the number to the safe!? Parrot: \"... 1228!\" *squawk* Maya: Alright! Uncle: H-hey! Polly! Watch it, will ya! Maya: Heh heh. See, Nick? All it takes is a little clever thinking! Phoenix: (And a criminal mind...) Maya: Quick, Nick! Write that number down! Phoenix: H-hey! Don't get me involved in your little heist schemes. What you saw (appears after presenting Attorney's Badge, then presenting Lake Photo) Uncle: I forget the time, but it was pretty dark outside... probably night, ayup. Phoenix: (It was after midnight, but okay...) Uncle: Then I heard this \"bang!\" So I looked outside. Then I heard another one. \"Bang!\" A little while later, this boat comes back. Then a young man walked by my window here. He was mutterin' something to himself, ayup. Maya: What did he say? Uncle: ... Ayup... ... I forgot. I'll remember tomorrow by court time, promise. Maya: We need to know earlier than that...! Present Attorney's Badge Uncle: *Zzzzz* ...! That a lawyer's badge? Phoenix: Y-yes, it is! (I don't believe it! This old guy is the first person to recognize my badge!) Uncle: ... I get it. Phoenix: Huh? Uncle: Ayup... I got you figured out now! You're not Keith! Phoenix: ... Maya: N-Nick!  Now's our chance to clear things up! Phoenix: Umm... sir. No, I'm not Keith. Maya: And I'm not Meg, either! Uncle: ... Phoenix: We're here investigating a murder that took place on this lake the other night. Maya: Please, help us! Uncle: ... Hmm... a lawyer, huh? Maya: Please, mister... Uncle: Alright, I'll help. But, on one condition. Maya: What's that? Uncle: When this case is over and done... You'll run the \"Wet Noodle\"! Promise to run the Noodle Leads to: \"Okay, we promise.\" We can't promise that Phoenix: I can't make that promise. Uncle: ... I-is that any way to treat your old man!? Bah! You want me help? You've come to the wrong man! Maya: Uh oh... now he's grumpy. Phoenix: Not to mention he still thinks we're his kids. (Maybe we should just lie and say we'll run his shop?) Leads to: \"Okay, we promise.\" Phoenix: Okay, we promise. Maya: N-Nick! Are you sure about this? Phoenix: Hey, anything to get the case solved. Also... Who wouldn't want to eat \"Phoenix Noodles\"? Maya: I... guess so. Uncle: That's my boy! Good for you, Keith. Phoenix: W-wait, didn't I just say... Uncle: You, too, Meg! Maya: Y-yes!? Uncle: Heh heh heh... you bring a tear to your old man's eye, you know. Now, what was that you wanted to know? Speak up, Polly! Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Maya: Er... Phoenix: (Now he's talking to the bird again! How do we get him to talk to us!?) Attorney's Badge (subsequent times) Uncle: You won't be needing that badge to run a pasta shop. Toss it. Phoenix: Uh, um, I think I'll hold on to it if you don't mind. Anything (before presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: *Zzzzz* Now, listen here, Keith. Remember that tricolor pasta we were talking about? Our \"Rainbolioli\"! I figured out the last color we should use! Indigo Blue! Maya: Indigo... Blue? Phoenix: (That didn't seem to work the way I thought it might.) Gourdy Article (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: You know about Gourdy? Uncle: Nope. Lake Photo (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: Ayup, I seen this. Phoenix: Y-you know something about this, sir!? Uncle: Keith. Phoenix: Y-yes? Uncle: It's okay. You can call me Dad. Phoenix: ... D-Dad! You know something about this!? Uncle: Ayup. The other night... out on the lake... Maya: Yes? Yes!? Uncle: I know all about that! I seen it. Maya: Whaaaat!? Tell us! Tell what you saw! Uncle: Well, I suppose. Since you're taking over the shop and all... Parrot (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: Polly here's my only friend in the world. Isn't that right, Polly? Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Uncle: Ayup. Anything else (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: ... *Zzzzz* Phoenix: (He fell asleep...) Uncle: *Zzzzz* *mmph* After clearing \"Polly\" and \"What you saw\" Talk options: Uncle: You know what? Eh? Little Terry was just here. Phoenix: \"Terry\"...? Uncle: Ayup, that kid next door. You always used to make him cry, remember? He was wearin' this tattered old coat. Got himself some whiskers growing out of his face. Phoenix: (He must be talking about Detective Gumshoe...) Uncle: He comes up and tells me to come down to court tomorrow. Maya: Really...? Phoenix: (Somehow I don't think we're going to get much useful information out of this guy.) Maya... maybe we should be leaving. Maya: I think you're right. Oh, wait--I had one more question. Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something? Parrot: *squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Maya: H-huh!? What did she just say, Nick? Phoenix: One more time, Polly! Parrot: \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Phoenix: (What!? The DL-6 Incident?) Hey, mister! I-I mean, Dad! Uncle: *Zzzzz* Phoenix: (This is getting weird... Who IS this old guy!?) Boat Rental Shop Maya: Why would that bird Polly know about DL-6...? Phoenix: We have to figure out who that old man is. Maya: Oh... Phoenix: What? Maya: He locked the door, from the other side. Phoenix: (... Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this DL-6 Incident... Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe.) After clearing \"Polly\" and \"What you saw\" Talk options in Caretaker's Shack: December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Gumshoe: Hey, pal! Long time no see! ... You don't look so happy. What's wrong this time? Phoenix: Actually, we wanted to ask you something... Gumshoe: Yeah? Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"I... I'm not gonna make it... Just... just arrest that guy for me... please... uggh!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for dying in action. Talk The boat caretaker Phoenix: You know the boat rental shop down at Gourd Lake? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah... Phoenix: The old man who runs it is appearing as a witness in court tomorrow, right? Gumshoe: Huh...!? How'd you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret. Maya: Do you know who that old man is, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Actually... I don't. He's a bit of an odd bird... I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn't persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That's why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea. Maya: Hmm... sounds suspicious! Gumshoe: Hmm... The DL-6 Incident Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, please, help us... Gumshoe: H-huh? Phoenix: We need to know about the DL-6 Incident! Gumshoe: ...! Phoenix: That was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case. Gumshoe: ... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal. Maya: What!? Gumshoe: However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up. Present Metal Detector Phoenix: Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. This was really helpful. Gumshoe: R-really? Maya: You seem surprised! Gumshoe: Huh? N-no, not at all. Glad it worked out for you. Parrot Gumshoe: What's that? A parrot? Phoenix: The old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that \"incident\"... Gumshoe: That incident? Phoenix: DL-6. Gumshoe: Wh-what!? Maya: Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something? Parrot: *squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Maya: H-huh!? Phoenix: I'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word... Gumshoe: Yeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident? Phoenix: Wait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6? Maya: N-Nick! You think he might be!? Gumshoe: ... After clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot: Gumshoe: ... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need. Maya: All right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room! Phoenix: (I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...) December 26Police DepartmentRecords Room Maya: Wow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty. Phoenix: Ten years of files and ten years of dust, I guess. Maya: Let's find that DL-6 stuff quick! Phoenix: (Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?) Maya: Nick! I found out where the file is! Phoenix: O-oh, thanks! Maya: Just let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file! Examine Glass case Phoenix: It looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside. Maya: Nick... it's locked. Phoenix: They must keep important case files in there. Back wall Phoenix: There are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity... Maya: Nick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me! Cabinet Phoenix: This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk. Maya: Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for? Phoenix: Don't touch that! It's evidence... Shelves Phoenix: Here are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here. Maya: Wow... these are all case reports!? Phoenix: Yeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases. Maya: I guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust. Talk The case summary Phoenix: Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary. Maya: Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go. Phoenix: December 28... 2001. Maya: That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow! Phoenix: (So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release) Maya: What!? Is this the same district courthouse where we're holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?] in the original release) Phoenix: Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out. Maya: Wow... that was some earthquake! Phoenix: At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours! Maya: That would be scary like that, in the dark! Phoenix: There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious. Maya: The survivors...? Phoenix: One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart. Maya: That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it. Phoenix: (He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.) Victim data Phoenix: Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father? Maya: Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it! Phoenix: Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles. Maya: \"Miles\"...! Phoenix: Miles Edgeworth, of course. Maya: So he was on the elevator with his father! Phoenix: From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?) Suspect data Phoenix: Got any data on the suspect in there? Maya: Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it. Phoenix: The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently. Maya: So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it! Phoenix: But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond. Maya: Hammond... the victim in our case! Phoenix: Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared. Maya: Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder? Phoenix: (He may be closer than we think...) Present Anything Maya: Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here... After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth... Maya: Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out. Phoenix: Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need... DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how \"Dad\" will do testifying in court... To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Goodbyes Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 December 27, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Karma: ... ... Judge: Very well, apparently the prosecution is also ready. Phoenix: (Who is the judge here, anyway!?) Judge: Mr. von Karma, your opening statement. Karma: ... ... Judge: Er... very well, no opening statement so... Karma: Karma: Not so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking! Judge: R-right, of course. Karma: A prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now! Judge: Order... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!? Karma: Karma: Bah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now! Judge: R-right... Karma: I call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand! Phoenix: (It's that mysterious boat shop owner.) Karma: Witness... state your profession. Uncle: Mmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the \"Wet Noodle\" at Gourd Lake. Karma: ... Uncle: And I, er, also rent boats. Karma: The night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct? Uncle: Er... ayup, yup I was. Karma: Please testify. Phoenix: (Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!) Raise an objection Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wait a minute!\" Let it slide Phoenix: (On second thought, I guess it doesn't really matter.) Maya: Doesn't matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don't find out who he is, we won't be able to build a case here! Phoenix: (Hmm, she has a point.) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wait a minute!\" Phoenix: Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet! Karma: Karma: Because I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate! Phoenix: (Yeah, right!) Judge: The witness will state his name. Uncle: Zzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup. Judge: What do you mean? Uncle: My, er, memory... Karma: Your Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name. Judge: Hmm... he can't recall, you say? Karma: Yes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify. Judge: Very well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness? Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder -- Uncle: It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup. I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual. Then I heard a \"bang!\" Ayup. When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake. Then I heard another \"bang.\" Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window. Judge: Hmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination... Karma: Karma: There is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now! Judge: Er... yes... M-Mr. Wright...? Cross-examine Phoenix: What are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness! Judge: Hmm... Very well, you may begin. Leads to: \"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\" Don't cross-examine Phoenix: (He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.) Maya: B-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance! Phoenix: (O-oh... right.) Leads to: \"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\" Karma: Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! Judge: E-excuse me? Mr. von Karma? Karma: Three minutes just passed. Judge: I see. Well then, let's just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- The Night of the Murder -- Uncle: It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Just after midnight,\" you say? Uncle: Ayup, just around then. Phoenix: Are you sure? Uncle: Pretty sure, ayup. Phoenix: When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today. Uncle: ... Karma: Karma: I asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!? Uncle: Zzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup. Karma: You see? Continue! Uncle: I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is there anyone who can verify that? Uncle: ... Well, I guess Polly could. Phoenix: Th-that's not good enough for a court of law! Judge: Mr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough? Phoenix: Ah, uh, Your Honor, this \"Polly\" is a parrot. Judge: A... parrot? Uncle: Don't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy! Judge: Keith...? Karma: Karma: The prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue. Uncle: Then I heard a \"bang!\" Ayup. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And where did the \"bang\" seem to come from? Uncle: From the lake, I figure. Karma: Are you certain? Uncle: A-ayup. Karma: Good. Continue! Uncle: When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there someone in the boat? Uncle: It was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup. Phoenix: But you couldn't see them clearly! Uncle: Ayup... at the time, that is. Phoenix: (At the time...?) Uncle: Then I heard another \"bang.\" Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you heard two gunshots total? Uncle: Ayup. Phoenix: (That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.) Uncle: Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"By your window\"? Uncle: Ayup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack. Phoenix: And, could you see the man's face? Uncle: Well, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him. Judge: This is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony. Uncle: ... Karma: Tsk, tsk, tsk... Phoenix: (I have a bad feeling about this...) Adds statement \"That man was the defendant... he was saying \"I can't believe he's dead.\" Uncle: That man was the defendant... he was saying \"I can't believe he's dead.\" Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"A-are you sure!?\" Phoenix: (If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.) Phoenix: A-are you sure!? Uncle: ... Phoenix: (Uh oh!) D-Dad! Uncle: Dead certain, Keith! He said \"I can't believe he's dead\" as he was walking by, too. Karma: Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!? Uncle: It was him! That Edgeworth boy! Judge: ... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt. Phoenix: (von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!) Karma: Tsk, tsk, tsk... Maya: N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us! Phoenix: (I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!) Raise an objection Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun! Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...? Phoenix: Exactly! Karma: That is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true! Leads to: \"Hmm...\" Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?) Karma: Judge! There is no room for doubt in the witness's testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict! Leads to: \"Hmm...\" Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?) Raise an objection Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said \"I can' t believe he's dead\"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie... Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof! Phoenix: Urk... Maya: Nick! Do we have evidence...? Leads to: \"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\" Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.) Maya: Nick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure! Leads to: \"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\" Phoenix: It's no good! There's nothing I can do. Maya: A... are you sure? Phoenix: To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore. Maya: Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you... Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record. Judge: Enough! The witness may leave the stand. Uncle: Zzzz... Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. Phoenix: (W-what!? No!) Karma: Hmph. Judge: This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! W-w-waaaaaaait! Judge: Wh-who was that just now? Me!!! Phoenix: Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry! Judge: Wh-what are you doing here!? Butz: Listen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it! Judge: Remembered what? Butz: The gunshot! I heard it too! Judge: O-order! Karma: Karma: What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment! Judge: One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot? Butz: Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify! Judge: Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed... Karma: Judge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over! Maya: Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this! Phoenix: (She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...) Maya: Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse! Phoenix: You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now! Karma: A waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned! Judge: Hmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard! Karma: Wh-what is this!? Judge: I withdraw my previous verdict of \"guilty\"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now! Karma: Whaaaat! Judge: The court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned! December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2 Phoenix: Whew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph. I've seen worse. Phoenix: (Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there. Maya: Larry was at the lake that night? Phoenix: Yes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake. Maya: Oh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night? Phoenix: Yeah. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Huh? You say something, Wright? Phoenix: Yeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong? Edgeworth: It... it's nothing. Phoenix: Hmm? Maya: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you. Edgeworth: What's that? Maya: Why are your fingerprints on the murder weapon? Edgeworth: Oh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really. Maya: I see... Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Yeah? Edgeworth: This might be our chance. Phoenix: Our chance? Edgeworth: von Karma has only ever run perfect trials. Phoenix: Perfect trials...? Edgeworth: Perfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry! Phoenix: What are you getting at? Edgeworth: It's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright. Maya: That's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth! Phoenix: Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything's on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release) December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3 Judge: Court is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th. Butz: Right... leave it to me! Phoenix: (Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!) Karma: ... Phoenix: (von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...) Witness Testimony -- The Night of the Murder -- Butz: That night, I was out in a boat on the lake. I was looking for something and I, er, found it. So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock. Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"! I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat. So after I heard that single gunshot I went home. Judge: Hmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor... Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Phoenix: It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared. Maya: Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick! Cross Examination -- The Night of the Murder -- Butz: That night, I was out in a boat on the lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ... Judge: Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: There were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin... Judge: Ah... Phoenix: Um, well, okay. First of all, what time was it? Butz: Oh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak. Phoenix: And why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...? Butz: I was looking for something and I, er, found it. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Looking for something\"...? Butz: Er, yeah. Judge: Mr. Butz, what was it you were looking for? Karma: Karma: What the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this \"Gourdy\"! Phoenix: (You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.) Karma: This is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with. Butz: So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Around what time was that? Butz: Uh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah. Judge: You're not sure? Butz: Hey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!? Phoenix: (People use watches these days, Larry...) Butz: Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did the sound come from? Butz: Yeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know. Judge: Did you look at the lake? Butz: Yeah, I looked. Butz: I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wasn't there a boat on the lake!? Judge: Order! Order! Well? Mr. Butz! Butz: Whoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not. Phoenix: (Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!) Karma: Hmph! Butz: So after I heard that single gunshot I went home. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you only heard one \"bang\" correct? Butz: Yeah. Phoenix: (Huh.) Present Lotta's Deposition Phoenix: Leads to: \"W-wait a sec, Larry!\" Maya: Well, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions. Maya: Sorry... I wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister... Phoenix: W-wait a sec, Larry! Butz: Wh-what!? Phoenix: You only heard one \"bang\"!? You're sure!? Butz: That's what I said! Phoenix: But Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two \"bang\"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night! Butz: Huh? Phoenix: Were you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said? Butz: Yo, Nick, please! Phoenix: Huh? Butz: You know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!? Phoenix: ... Judge: Mr. Butz. Butz: What!? Judge: You only heard one gunshot? Are you sure? Butz: ... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure. Judge: Eh...? Phoenix: Not sure!? H-how could you not be sure? Butz: Yeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else... Phoenix: Something... else? Butz: My radio, dude! With my headphones. (Changed from [My radio, dude! On my headphones.] in the original release) Phoenix: Whaaaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to the radio with your headphones? (Changed from [You were listening to a radio on earphones?] in the original release) Butz: Y-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!? Judge: Hmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion? Karma: Waste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony. Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony? That's enough Phoenix: (No, I think I've heard enough. This is all too embarrassing... In fact, I think we've all heard enough.) Maya: What are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty! We have to turn this trial around now! Phoenix: Uh... Leads to: \"Your Honor.\" Continue Leads to: \"Your Honor.\" Phoenix: Your Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony. Karma: Bah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost! Judge: Very well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO. Butz: Right! Leave it to me! Phoenix: (I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.) Witness Testimony -- What Larry Heard -- Butz: It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve! That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see? I was listening to it real booming loud, like. But I'm sure I heard that gunshot! I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too. Judge: You were listening to your radio... at a high volume!? Butz: Yeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!? Phoenix: (I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem here is.) Karma: Judge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio! Judge: True enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot! Judge: Excuse me? \"Dee-jay\"...? Phoenix: An announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! Judge: V-very well, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...) Cross Examination -- What Larry Heard -- Butz: It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you turned on the radio? Butz: Right! I just wanted to hear someone's voice, y'know? You don't know what it's like out there, alone, on Christmas Eve! Alone! Phoenix: (I shouldn't have said anything...) Butz: That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you by any chance remember the name of the program you were listening to? Karma: Karma: This has nothing to do with the case, Your Honor! Judge: Objection sustained. The witness was listening to the radio. That is all we need to know. Tell us, Mr. Butz, how loud was your radio set to that night? Butz: I was listening to it real booming loud, like. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Real \"booming\" loud? Butz: Yeah, y'know. Judge: And you had headphones on? Butz: Yup. Judge: I wouldn't think you could hear anything going on outside at all... Butz: But I'm sure I heard that gunshot! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can you prove that...? No... no, of course you can't. Butz: Nah, I can't prove it. But I remember that moment real clear. I mean, while I was talking about it, it came back real clear to me, y'know? Butz: I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What did she say? (Changed from [What did he say?] in the original release) Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! Please cease these pointless questions! What possible good could knowing what a radio DJ said do us!? Judge: Indeed, Mr. von Karma has a point. I'll allow the question only if you see some reason why we should care...? We don't care Phoenix: (Hmm... right. I didn't really have a deep reason for asking that question, now that I think about it.) Understood, Your Honor. I withdraw my question. Judge: Continue your examination of the witness, then. Phoenix: (This is getting nowhere...) Leads back to cross-examination We should care Phoenix: We should care, Your Honor! Of course we should! Karma: Why? Phoenix: Uh. W-well, how do you know if we don't ask, hmm? Judge: Fine, very well. Mr. Butz, please testify to the court. What was the radio announcer saying when you heard the gunshot? Adds statement \"Just when she said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" I heard the gunshot!\" Butz: Just when she said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" I heard the gunshot! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure? Butz: Course I am! She had this real sexy voice... Phoenix: (Hmm... maybe von Karma was right. I'm not sure how that helped us at all.) Present Lake Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!? Butz: Huh? What's with the face? You look scary, dude. Hey, if you're trying to scare me, you better know I don't scare that easy! Judge: Is something the matter, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" when he heard the gunshot! Judge: Indeed... And...? Phoenix: \"Almost Christmas\" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!! Judge: That would seem to be the case, yes... Phoenix: But he should have heard that gunshot after midnight! This photograph is irrefutable proof of this fact! Judge: Let's see what the time was on the photo taken when the gun triggered Ms. Hart's camera. < 12/25 00:15 >...! Fifteen minutes after midnight, on Christmas Day! Leads to: \"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!\" Present Lotta's Deposition Phoenix: Phoenix: Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!? Butz: Huh? What's with the face? You look scary, dude. Hey, if you're trying to scare me, you better know I don't scare that easy! Judge: Is something the matter, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" when he heard the gunshot! Judge: Indeed... And...? Phoenix: \"Almost Christmas\" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!! Judge: That would seem to be the case, yes... Phoenix: But that contradicts the two testimonies we have heard, Your Honor! Both Ms. Hart and the old man said it was after midnight when they heard the shots! In other words... When they heard the gunshots, it was already Christmas!!! Leads to: \"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!\" Phoenix: (This is the most ludicrous testimony I've ever heard. But there is one gleaming ray of hope in there! I've got to press it until we get to the bottom of what happened!) Phoenix: This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor! Judge: Order! Order! What does this mean? The two prior witnesses heard gunshots after midnight. However, this witness says he heard a gunshot before midnight... Karma: Judge. The answer is simple. The current witness is plainly mistaken. Just look at him! Suspicious! Butz: Wh-whaaat!? Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think about Mr. Butz's claim that he heard the gunshot before midnight? Larry's wrong Phoenix: Well... I guess, it had to have been Larry's mistake. Karma: Hah! Judge: Very well. Butz: W-w-waaaaait! I come up here, I give you a riveting testimony... And you laugh it off as some kinda mistake!? What about me!? How can you call yourself a friend, Nick? How!? Get used to disappointment!!! Phoenix: ... Leads back to: \"Well, Mr. Wright?\" Larry's right Leads to: \"Larry's not mistaken, Your Honor!\" Phoenix: Larry's not mistaken, Your Honor! He heard that gunshot before midnight! Karma: ... Intriguing. I'm assuming you have evidence for this wild claim? Show me evidence there was a gunshot before midnight! Present Second Lake Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: Look at this photograph! This was taken by our witness yesterday, Ms. Lotta Hart, with her automatic camera. The timestamp on the photo reads \"December 24, 11:50 PM.\" Judge: Oh yeah? Hmm? But, there's nothing on the lake in this picture. Phoenix: Your Honor. The real issue here is not why nothing is shown in the photograph. It is why this photograph exists at all! Judge: What do you mean? Phoenix: Your Honor... This photograph was taken by an automatic camera. That camera was set to go off in response to loud noises! Judge: Ahah! Phoenix: Correct! There was a loud noise on the lake at 11:50 PM. That is why this photograph was taken! In other words... When Larry heard that gunshot, it was most definitely Christmas Eve! Judge: Indeed, it would seem that is the case! Then... where does that leave us? Ms. Hart testified that she heard the gunshots after midnight. Are you claiming she was mistaken? Phoenix: Not at all, Your Honor. It is a fact that the camera also triggered at 15 minutes after midnight! Your Honor! That night, there were two sets of gunshots, with a 25 minute pause between them! Judge: Why would this be...? Karma: Karma: Don't be fooled, Judge! That camera was set to respond to \"loud noises\"! Judge: Yes? Karma: There is no proof that the \"loud noise\" at 11:50 was a gunshot! Why, the witness could have sneezed, triggering the camera! Butz: H-hey, my noise was clear that night, man! Clear! Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? There's no turning back now. Can you prove that the \"loud noise\" at 11:50 PM was indeed a gunshot? Please show the court evidence if you have any. Present Pistol Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is my evidence.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Mr. Wright... Is that a smirk I see? Phoenix: Er, Your Honor... sorry, I wasn't really sure about the evidence. Judge: Don't show us evidence you aren't confident in Mr. Wright! I'll ask you again. Leads back to: \"Can you prove that the \"loud noise\" at 11:50 PM was indeed a gunshot?\" Phoenix: This is my evidence. Judge: The... murder weapon? Phoenix: Something about this pistol was bothering me, Your Honor. Both of the witnesses who testified yesterday heard two gunshots. However, the murder weapon was fired three times. When, then, was the last shot fired? Only now have I realized the truth. That third shot was the shot Larry heard just before midnight! Leads to: \"Order! Order!\" Present Pistol Phoenix: Phoenix: This is my evidence. Judge: The... murder weapon? Phoenix: Something about this pistol was bothering me, Your Honor. Both of the witnesses who testified yesterday heard two gunshots. However, the murder weapon was fired three times. When, then, was the last shot fired? Only now have I realized the truth. That third shot was the shot Larry heard just before midnight! Judge: Order! Order! Hmm... I guess that would make sense out of yesterday's testimonies. Karma: Karma: Bah! You waste our time again with your empty statements! Yes, the pistol was fired three times. But do you have any proof that it was fired before midnight!? Do you have proof that the witness didn't just \"think\" he heard something? Judge: Indeed... Well, Mr. Wright? There's no turning back now. Do you have evidence that proves there was a gunshot before midnight? Do you have evidence that proves Mr. Butz wasn't just hearing things? Present Second Lake Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Look at this photograph!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Mr. Wright... Is that a smirk I see? Phoenix: Er, Your Honor... sorry, I wasn't really sure about the evidence. Judge: Don't show us evidence you aren't confident in Mr. Wright! I'll ask you again. Leads back to: \"Do you have evidence that proves there was a gunshot before midnight?\" Phoenix: Look at this photograph! This was taken by our witness yesterday, Ms. Lotta Hart, with her automatic camera. The timestamp on the photo reads \"December 24, 11:50 PM.\" Judge: Oh yeah? Hmm? But, there's nothing on the lake in this picture. Phoenix: Your Honor. The real issue here is not why nothing is shown in the photograph. It is why this photograph exists at all! Judge: What do you mean? Phoenix: Your Honor... This photograph was taken by an automatic camera. That camera was set to go off in response to loud noises! Judge: Ahah! Phoenix: Correct! There was a loud noise on the lake at 11:50 PM. That is why this photograph was taken! In other words... There was a gunshot at the time that Larry claims! Leads to: \"Order! Order!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Karma: I have a favorite saying. I'd like to share it with the court. \"Youth and stupidity go hand in hand.\" Get rid of both, and I'll allow you show me this rubbish you call \"evidence\"!!! Phoenix: (In other words, I picked the wrong evidence to show him...) Karma: ... I can tell from your face you haven't learned your lesson. Very well, try again. Show us your evidence! Leads back to: \"Show me evidence there was a gunshot before midnight!\" Judge: Order! Order! Hmm... That would make sense of the evidence we've seen so far. ... However... This leaves me wondering exactly what did happen that night on the lake. Karma: Exactly! If this is true, there were two sets of gunshots, separated by 25 minutes! One at 11:50, another at 15 minutes after midnight! Why, I ask you! Why!? Phoenix: (Uh oh, I'd better think of something quick! ... Wait a second...! Gunshots separated by 25 minutes...?) Aaaaaaaaaaah! Maya: Wh-what's wrong, Nick? Phoenix: I have it! I have it! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: Remember the case with the Steel Samurai!? Maya: Huh? Yeah, of course I remember... Phoenix: The murderer in this case had the same idea as the murderer in that case! Maya: What do you mean? Phoenix: Maya! Maya: Yes!? Phoenix: If we don't figure this out now, we'll never overturn Edgeworth's guilty verdict! I've got a hunch, and I'm going to run with it... Maya: Right! I mean... is this safe? Phoenix: Safe? We've already gotten a guilty verdict! We have nothing to lose! Maya: ... Phoenix: You just watch and let me know if I say anything that sounds fishy, okay? Maya: Right, Nick! Phoenix: Your Honor! Judge: Y-yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The testimony just now has cleared up this entire case! Judge: What do you mean, Mr. Wright!? Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... So, you've finally realized the truth? There can be no other murderer here than Miles Edgeworth himself. Phoenix: Wrong, von Karma! A man was shot that night, but it wasn't Edgeworth who did the shooting! Karma: Listen, rookie. Take a deep breath, and consider the facts. At the time of the murder, one boat was on the lake. This was shown by the witness's photograph. The defendant, Edgeworth, and victim, Robert Hammond, were on that boat. There was a gunshot fired on that boat, and Robert Hammond fell into the lake. The distance of the shooting was one meter. It couldn't have been suicide! Well? The guilty party has to be the other man on that boat! Judge: I admit, it is hard to imagine any other possibility. Phoenix: Yes... But this assumes that the victim was shot at 15 minutes after midnight. Judge: ... What do you mean by that, Mr. Wright? We have photographic evidence of the time of the shooting. The timestamp on the photo says 00:15. Phoenix: But Larry heard a gunshot 25 minutes before that! Robert Hammond was killed then! 25 minutes before the shot on the lake! (That's the only way that Edgeworth could be innocent!) Judge: ... Karma: ... Mr. Wright. Are you quite mad? Explain who the two men on the boat are! (Changed from [Explain who this is sitting on the boat!] in the original release) The murderer and Hammond Phoenix: It was the murderer and Robert Hammond! Karma: Karma: What are you saying!? That contradicts what you just told the court. You said that Robert Hammond had been killed 25 minutes before this gunshot! Phoenix: Y-yes, that's right. Judge: Also, might I mention... The defendant, Mr. Edgeworth, has admitted to being on that boat. Phoenix: Er, right, Your Honor. (Crash and burn...) Judge: Mr. Wright! Your client has already been declared guilty once! I'm going to have to penalize you for this foolishness. Phoenix: (*sigh*) Karma: Bah! I'll ask you again! Leads back to: \"Explain who the two men on the boat are!\" Edgeworth and the murderer Leads to: \"Of course, it was Edgeworth and the murderer!\" Edgeworth and Hammond Phoenix: Miles Edgeworth and Robert Hammond! Karma: Karma: Yes, I believe you are mad! That is exactly what I've been telling the court this whole time! You're agreeing with me! And yet, what did you just say? That Robert Hammond had been killed 25 minutes before the shot on the boat!? Phoenix: Y-yes, that's what I said! I was just testing you, von Karma! Judge: Mr. Wright! Your client has already been declared guilty once! I'm going to have to penalize you for this foolishness. Phoenix: (*sigh*) Karma: Bah! I'll ask you again! Leads back to: \"Explain who the two men on the boat are!\" Phoenix: Of course, it was Edgeworth and the murderer! After the murderer killed Robert Hammond at 11:50... He assumed the guise of Mr. Hammond and met Edgeworth! Judge: Wh... What!? Are you serious? Phoenix: Yes. Edgeworth won't tell us why he went to the lake that night. However, I have a hunch. That night, Robert Hammond called Edgeworth to the lake. Now, Edgeworth didn't know Robert Hammond's face that well. That's why he didn't suspect anything when the murderer took Robert Hammond's place! Judge: ... I'm not sure what to make of all this. Karma: L-Ludicrous! Judge: Mr. Wright. Tell us the name of the murderer then! Phoenix: The murderer's name...? Right! It's... Miles Edgeworth Phoenix: (On second thought, that's a really dumb answer... I might get a laugh or two out of the crowd, but that's about it.) Maya: Uh, Nick? Something on your mind? Phoenix: Huh? Oh, uh, nothing. Hah hah. *groan* Judge: Mr. Wright! Stop laughing and tell us who the murderer is! Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor! Leads back to: \"The murderer's name...? Right! It's...\" Lotta Hart Phoenix: The murderer is none other than Ms. Lotta Hart! Judge: ... The investigative photographer...? Phoenix: Um, yes. Judge: You're saying that young lady dressed up like Robert Hammond and fooled Mr. Edgeworth? Phoenix: Y-yes, well, she did look sort of manly. Karma: Karma: I am ashamed I actually listened to this utter nonsense. Listen! You came to this conclusion based on a piece of evidence. That is, this photograph taken at 11:50. If you didn't have this photograph, you never would have made this claim! Correct? And just who was it who went out of her way to give you that piece of evidence? Phoenix: ...! It was... Lotta Hart. Karma: Why would the murderer go to all that trouble just to deliver you decisive evidence! Phoenix: ... I guess... they wouldn't. Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm going to penalize you for this. Phoenix: (Whoops.) Judge: Mr. Wright! Can you really tell us the name of the murderer!? Phoenix: (Uh oh, he looks suspicious! I'd better bluff and bluff good!) Leads back to: \"The murderer's name...? Right! It's...\" I don't know Leads to: \"Actually, I don't know the murderer's name.\" Phoenix: Actually, I don't know the murderer's name. Judge: Y-you don't know!? Karma: Bah! Again, you waste my time! Phoenix: I don't know because he never told us! Karma: ...! Phoenix: The murderer is the caretaker of the boat shop, that old man! At 11:50, he was the one who killed Robert Hammond. Judge: The caretaker of the boat shop!? Wh-where did he do this!? There weren't any boats on the lake then! Phoenix: Why would he have to go all the way out on the lake just to shoot someone? May I suggest... That the real scene of the crime was not in a boat! Judge: What!? W-well then, where did the murder take place!? Phoenix: (Show the judge where the murder really took place!) Present Boat Rental Shop Phoenix: Leads to: \"Here, of course! The boat shop, where he lives.\" Present Gourd Lake Woods Phoenix: Phoenix: It was here! Judge: ... Where Ms. Hart, the photographer was camping? Phoenix: Yes. Judge: Why would the caretaker of the boat shop go there to kill someone? Phoenix: It was probably an honest mistake. Judge: The caretaker made a mistake? Phoenix: No, I did. Judge: ... Maybe you'd like to show us again? Leads back to: \"Show the judge where the murder really took place!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Around here, maybe? Judge: \"Maybe\", Mr. Wright...? (Changed from [Around... where?] in the original release) And does this \"maybe\" include the reason why the killer would choose that spot? (Changed from [You have some reason for thinking this?] in the original release) Phoenix: Yes, well... Maybe because there IS no good reason, the murderer thought we'd never expect it! (Changed from [Maybe because there's no good reason, the murderer knew we'd never expect it!] in the original release) Judge: ... Maybe you should try again. (Changed from [Try again.] in the original release) Phoenix: (He wasn't even surprised I goofed up.) Leads back to: \"Show the judge where the murder really took place!\" Phoenix: Here, of course! The boat shop, where he lives. That way he could meet with the victim without anyone seeing! Karma: Karma: Do you have proof that the boat shop was the scene of the crime!? Phoenix: Recall Larry's testimony if you will. That night he was out on the lake in a boat, searching for something. He finds it, and returns the boat. Then, just as he's starting to head for home, he hears a gunshot! He heard a gunshot, Your Honor! Even though he was wearing headphones at the time! In other words, the gunshot was very, very close by! And where would that be if he had just returned a boat? Judge: The boat shop...! Mr. Wright! What happened that night on Gourd Lake!? Please tell the court, from the beginning! Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor. Maya: Nick, are you sure about this...? Phoenix: Um, not really. But, I think if I start at the very beginning... And I take it slow, I must just be able to figure this out... Phoenix: That night... The caretaker of the boat shop called Robert Hammond to his shop. This was around 11:50. That was when the gunshot that Larry heard was fired. After that, the caretaker put on Robert Hammond's coat... He became Robert Hammond! Then he got in the boat with Edgeworth, and went out into the middle of the lake. Judge: Then... who fired the pistol on the boat, Mr. Wright? Miles Edgeworth Phoenix: It was Miles Edgeworth... Maya: N-Nick! How could that be!? Wasn't the old man holding the pistol!? Phoenix: Uh, yeah. Good thinking! Maya: That was easy, Nick! What I'm worried about is what you're thinking! Leads to: \"Of course, it was the murderer who shot the pistol.\" The boat shop caretaker Leads to: \"Of course, it was the murderer who shot the pistol.\" Phoenix: Of course, it was the murderer who shot the pistol. He shot twice. Both missed Edgeworth, on purpose. Judge: Wait a minute... Phoenix: Y-yes? Judge: Why would he shoot twice if he didn't mean to hit anyone? Phoenix: Uh... (Details! Details!) Karma: Know this, Mr. Wright. The moment you run out of explanations is the moment you lose. Tell us why the murderer had to fire twice! Because the first shot missed Phoenix: B-because the first shot missed? Judge: Missed? Phoenix: Yeah, he was aiming for Edgeworth, and he missed... Karma: Karma: What are you saying!? Did you not just tell us that he missed Edgeworth on purpose!? Phoenix: Huh? Oh, uh, right. (Uh oh... I'd better figure out just what it is I'm trying to prove here.) Leads to: \"I believe he shot twice to create a witness, Your Honor.\" To create a witness Leads to: \"I believe he shot twice to create a witness, Your Honor.\" Phoenix: I believe he shot twice to create a witness, Your Honor. Judge: Create a witness...? Phoenix: The murderer lifts his pistol and fires one shot. That ensures that anyone who heard the shot would look at the lake. Indeed, Ms. Hart did exactly that after hearing the first gunshot. Next! The murderer waits a bit and he fires again. Then... The murderer jumps from the boat himself! Leaving the pistol in the boat behind him. Judge: ... I see! To someone looking from the edge of the lake... It would appear that one of the men on the boat had shot the other! Phoenix: The murderer didn't know about the automatic camera, of course. That's why he shot twice to draw attention to the boat! Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: Once you realize that, everything else falls into place! The boat shop caretaker swam back to his shop. Then he put Mr. Hammond's coat back on the body. And threw the body into the lake! This is what happened, Your Honor. These are the events that transpired that night on Gourd Lake. Judge: ... Karma: ... ... Judge: ... Bailiff! Bring out the witness from before! The boat shop caretaker! Quickly! Judge: Very well. While we are waiting for the caretaker... I would like to ask the defendant, Miles Edgeworth, a few questions. Mr. Edgeworth. Please take the stand. Judge: Mr. Edgeworth... You heard what the defense has said? Edgeworth: Yes. Judge: Well? Why did you go to the lake that night? Edgeworth: ... What Wright has said was mostly correct. Astonishingly so, actually. Yes... Several days ago, I received a letter. The letter was signed, \"Robert Hammond.\" He asked me to come to the boat shop by the lake at midnight on Christmas Eve. He said he had something very important to discuss with me. Judge: Something important? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry. I can't say what it was. Judge: Hmm... Guard: Your Honor, sir! Judge: Bailiff! We are conducting a trial here, I ask that you remain quiet... Guard: The witness has disappeared! He isn't at the boat shop, either! Judge: What!? Guard: What should I do? Judge: F-find him, quickly! We cannot allow him to get away! Judge: Mr. von Karma! Your witness has disappeared! Karma: ... A search warrant has already been issued. Judge: Hmm... It goes without saying that I cannot declare a verdict under these circumstances. I will extend the trial until tomorrow, the final day allowed. I request that the police department utilize all its forces to find that witness! Am I understood? Karma: ... Judge: One more thing. Just who is that boat shop caretaker? I think his identity has become very important to this trial. I want him, and I want to know who he is. Karma: ... Judge: Very well. Court is adjourned! December 27, 1:22 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2 Maya: Yay, Nick! You did it! Phoenix: Yeah... Well, at least we got out from under that guilty verdict... Maya: And what about Larry! That was something else! Even von Karma didn't know what to do with his testimony! Larry really helped us out! Phoenix: Sure, once I sifted through his \"unique\" testimony. Still... he did save us. I just wish our cases weren't so down to the wire all the time. Maya: I know what you mean. Sometimes I feel like it's us on trial instead of our clients! Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ... Maya: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ! D-did you say something? Maya: Don't look so pained! I mean, it looks like you're probably going to get off the hook! You could try to smile just a little...? Relax! Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry... But... I fear it's not over for me yet. Phoenix: Wh-what do you mean? Edgeworth: Wright... There's something that's been troubling me for a long time now. And I don't know whether or not to tell you... Phoenix: Edgeworth? Edgeworth: No... there's so little time left. I want to tell you, to get it off my chest, but... ... Hmm. I can't make up my mind. ... Phoenix: What is this about, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... It's... a nightmare I've had. A memory of a crime... that I committed. Phoenix: A crime you committed? Edgeworth: A memory... of a murder. To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Goodbyes Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 December 27, 2:11 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: What was Mr. Edgeworth talking about...? Edgeworth: A memory of a crime... that I committed. A memory... of a murder. Maya: Do you really think Mr. Edgeworth killed...? Phoenix: ... I don't believe it. Not Edgeworth. Some painful memory has been troubling him recently... But he'd never take someone's life! Never! Maya: Nick... Butz: Yo! How's everyone doing? Whaddya think of my performance today? I had 'em swooning in the aisles! Huh, Maya? Maya: S-swooning? Me? Oh... Oh, yes. I do remember feeling faint. Butz: Right on! Tell me the truth, it was like love at first sight, right? Right, Nick? Phoenix: H-huh? Me!? I... uh, well, maybe my heart skipped a beat or two... Butz: ... I think you can do better than that! C'mon! I saved Edgeworth in there, dude! Edgey! You guys should be bowing before me! Yeah! Bow before your hero! Talk Today's trial Phoenix: Larry... You really helped out in the trial today. Maya: You did! If you weren't there, Larry, I'm sure Mr. Edgeworth would have been found guilty! Butz: Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah! But, seriously, Nick. That boat shop caretaker guy is pretty suspicious... But Edgey ain't off the hook yet! Maya: Way to spoil the mood, Larry. Butz: Hey, I'm just a guy sitting in the audience, you know? But from where I was sitting, Edgey seemed pretty... edgy. I mean, can you really know he's telling the truth about that night? Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick? Phoenix: I don't know. But... what I do know is... I'm going to believe in you two until the end. Butz: Us two? Maya: Edgeworth and... who else? You mean me right? Butz: Nah! He means me! Right, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, you, Larry. Maya: Not... me? ... B-but why you, Larry!? Butz: Huh? Um, actually, yeah. Why me, Nick? Phoenix: ... Maya: Hmph. Enough with the silent treatment! Edgeworth Maya: Nick... Why do you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much? I mean, he's changed recently, true. But when we first met him, he was kind of jerk, don't ya think? Phoenix: ... You didn't know him back then. Back when he wanted to become a defense attorney. Maya: Wait... Was that when you two were classmates? Phoenix: Yes. In grade school... They saved me... Miles... And Larry. They saved me and I'll never forget it. That's why I became a defense attorney, you know. Maya: Whaaaat!? Hey, hey, Larry. What's he talking about? Butz: Huh? Uh... umm... Er, sorry. I kinda forgot. Maya: Hmph. Okay, Nick. Out with it! I'm going to hear this story today, and that's final! Phoenix: Okay, okay. It's kind of a long story, so hang in there. ... It was the very end of 3rd grade. (Changed from [It was the beginning of Spring, 4th grade.] in the original release) I was on trial. A class trial. Maya: A c-class trial!? The class trial (appears after \"Edgeworth\") Phoenix: You remember, Larry? Spring, end of 3rd grade? (Changed from [You remember, Larry? Spring, 4th grade?] in the original release) A kid in our class got his lunch money stolen. (Changed from [A kid in my class got his lunch money stolen.] in the original release) Maya: Lunch money? Phoenix: Our school was really small. Every month, kids would bring in an envelope with money for lunch from home. Maya: Huh, I see. Phoenix: Anyway, this kid's envelope disappeared. With $38.00 still inside. Butz: Oh... Yeah, now that you mention it, I do remember that! Phoenix: I can see why you'd forget, though. You were out of school that day. Anyway, the envelope had been stolen during PE class. I was coming down with a cold, so I'd skipped PE that day. I was the only one not in class. Maya: So... they thought you did it? Phoenix: Yeah. The kids in class said I should be put on trial. Maya: Trial...? Phoenix: So the next day we held a classroom trial, with me as the defendant. Phoenix: \"I... I didn't do it!\" \"Guilty!\" \"He did it!\" \"Guilty!\" \"It was you! \"Thief!\" \"Give me my money back!\" \"You're such a meanie!\" \"No one play with him!\" \"Just admit you did it!\" \"You can't hide the truth!\" \"Tell us the truth!\" \"We're not gonna play with you anymore!\" \"Yeah, and no borrowing my eraser!\" \"He shouldn't be allowed in the relay race!\" \"Or on the library committee!\" \"Give me back the 50 cents I loaned you!\" \"Hey, did you rob that bank the other day?\" Teacher: \"Now, Phoenix, you know you shouldn't steal people's money! It's not right.\" Phoenix: In the end, even the teacher thought I'd done it. Teacher: \"Go over and apologize, Phoenix.\" (Changed from [Apologize to the class, Phoenix.] in the original release) Phoenix: I... I didn't know what was happening. I was so sad... I couldn't stop crying. Everyone was staring at me like I'd done it... I tried to apologize. I went over to where the boy was sitting... ... That's when it happened. ???: \"He shouldn't have to apologize! The only thing that belongs in a trial is evidence! Anything else has no place! You should all be ashamed... Amateurs!\" Teacher: \"M-Miles?\" Edgeworth: \"It wasn't you who stole my money, was it?\" Phoenix: \"No...\" Edgeworth: \"Then you shouldn't apologize! Everyone's been shouting you did it, but no one has any proof! That is why, Your Honor, this boy is innocent!\" Teacher: \"B-but Miles, it was your money that was stolen!\" \"Yeah yeah!\" \"He did it! He's the one!\" \"We don't need proof!\" \"Make him say he's sorry!\" \"Why don't you all just shut up!!!\" Butz: \"This is always how it is, everybody ganging up and picking on one person. Just think how he feels! He said he didn't do it, so he didn't do it!\" ... Teacher: \"Very well. I will replace the money myself. This class trial is over.\" Phoenix: That's how it happened. After that, the three of us were the best of friends. (Changed from [After that, the three of us were always friends.] in the original release) Maya: Wow... I had no idea! Butz: Yeah... I had no idea, either! I mean, I forgot. Phoenix: That's what I learned what it meant to be alone. Totally alone, without a friend in the world. Maya: You did a good thing, Larry! Butz: Um, yeah, well... I was just lucky that I took the day off from school. If I'd been there they would have thought I'd done it! So, I took it kind of personally, see. Phoenix: (\"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\") After the trial (Changed from [Edgeworth's goals] in the original release) (appears after \"The class trial\") Phoenix: Anyway, Edgeworth and I talked after that class trial. That's when I heard his father was a defense attorney. I remember his eyes would shine when he talked about his father. (Comma after [remember] in the original release) Edgeworth: \"I'm going to become a defense attorney, just like my father! (Changed from [I'm going to become a defense attorney, just like my Dad!] in the original release) A famous defense attorney!\" Phoenix: Then, a few months later, he suddenly transferred to another school. Maya: The DL-6 Incident... Phoenix: Right. I'm not sure, but the transfer probably had to do with his father's death. Maya: That's so sad! Phoenix: ... It was several years later when I heard Edgeworth's name again. There was an article about him in the newspaper. The headline was something like \"Dark Suspicions of a Demon Attorney.\" Fabricating evidence, manipulating testimonies, covering up facts... The article said he'd do anything to get a guilty verdict. Anything. Butz: But why? What happened!? I mean, that's not the Edgey I used to know at all! Phoenix: That's what I thought too. I tried to get in touch with him I don't know how many times... He never replied. Maya: I guess he didn't want to see his old friends... Phoenix: I couldn't just drop it, though. I wanted to meet him, to learn why he had become who he became. (Changed from [I wanted to meet him, to know why he had become who he became.] in the original release) That's when I decided. Maya: ...! Wait... You don't mean...? That's why!? That's why you became a defense attorney!? To meet Edgeworth!? Phoenix: If I was a defense attorney, I knew he'd have to meet me whether he wanted to or not. In court. ... Edgeworth believed in me, and I believe in him. He's in pain... And no one's on his side. I'm the only one who knows the real Edgeworth. I'm the only one who can help him. Butz: Whoa... Nick. S-so, is that why you helped me out for free? Phoenix: Uh... yes. I helped you because I believed in you. (Except I don't remember saying I'd do it for free...) Butz: Aw, Nick! Nick!!! Maya: Nick! We have to save Mr. Edgeworth if it's the last thing we do, okay? Phoenix: Right. (It very well may be...) Maya: First, there's that rental boat shop caretaker. We need to find out who or what he is! Phoenix: I'd settle for who. (I guess I can clean out some of this evidence I no longer need... ...) Okay, let's go! Present Anything Butz: Woo hoo, I was hot in there. Hot! Phoenix: (I'm glad someone's happy about how this case is going... He seems too happy to care about anything I show him.) Before clearing \"After the trial\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices: December 27Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: ... Looks like Edgeworth is back in questioning. Maya: We have our own questions for him! Let's come back later. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess so. Maya: Don't forget, okay? December 27Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Phoenix: (Hmm... Looks like Detective Gumshoe hasn't gotten back yet.) Police: Gumshoe? He won't be coming back today. Maya: Oh... really? Police: He said there was some guy he had to arrest by tomorrow. Phoenix: (The boat shop caretaker...) Police: He shouted something about \"catching him if it's the last thing I do, pal!\" Phoenix: (Good luck, Gumshoe!) Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"Please! Think about what you're doing, Jolinda! Don't take my Tommy away from me! No!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for a nasty divorce argument. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: Wha...!? Th-that's not possible! The world ended... yesterday!? Phoenix: (He must be reading predictions for the future on someone's homepage.) December 27Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: He's out... again. Maya: When does he work, anyway? Phoenix: Now, now. Don't be harsh. (Guess we'll have to come back later.) After clearing \"After the trial\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices: December 27Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: You look grim as always. Edgeworth: Hmph. Maya: Um, Mr. Edgeworth? I heard the story about the class trial... Edgeworth: Class trial? What do you mean? Maya: You... don't remember? Edgeworth: No, I don't. Maya: Your lunch money was stolen, wasn't it? In 3rd grade...? (Changed from [Your lunch money was stolen, wasn't it? In 4th grade...?] in the original release) Edgeworth: Lunch money...? ... Oh... Oh, right. Yes, I seem to remember something like that. Maya: Nick. I think you're the only one who really remembers. Phoenix: Well, it probably only really mattered to me anyway. Maya: Mr. Edgeworth, didn't you know? That trial was the reason Nick became a defense attorney! Edgeworth: ... Ridiculous! Phoenix: (Gee... thanks.) Edgeworth: That said... It does sound like that kind of thing you'd do. You haven't changed a bit, have you, Wright? So...simple. To a fault, even. Phoenix: Well, maybe yeah, but... I think you changed too much, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Perhaps. Talk Why prosecute? Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth. Why did you become a prosecutor, anyway? You used to look up to your dad... You said you wanted to be a defense attorney, right? Edgeworth: ... I couldn't let myself deny reality like you. Phoenix: What do you mean? Edgeworth: My father was taken from me, and you want me to defend criminals? I'm sorry, Wright, but I'm not that good of a person! Maya: One suspect was apprehended in your father's murder, right? Edgeworth: Yes. The man trapped in the elevator with my father. His name... was Yanni Yogi. He had to be the shooter, any way you look at it! Yet... he was found innocent. That defense attorney got him off the hook! Phoenix: (That would be Robert Hammond...) Edgeworth: On that day, 15 years ago... The three of us were trapped in that elevator for five hours. When we were rescued, we all suffered oxygen deprivation. I had lost all memory of the murder. Phoenix: Lost your memory? Edgeworth: Even now, I can't recall what happened in that elevator. That was the crux of Yogi's argument in court. He claimed Yanni Yogi had been \"not of sound mind\" due to the oxygen deprivation. Yogi was released due to a lack of evidence... innocent. That's when I changed my mind. I started to hate defense attorneys. Prosecutor von Karma Phoenix: What's your relationship with von Karma? Edgeworth: He's my teacher, and a man who deserves respect. I learned everything I know of courtroom techniques from him. Maya: So, he's like my sister was to you, Nick. Edgeworth: He is a perfectionist in all things. In court... In his personal life... He is obsessed with doing everything perfectly. Maya: Perfectly, huh? Edgeworth: In all the cases he has taken on, none were left unsolved. And not one suspect was declared innocent. Ever. Maya: But... but that's... Edgeworth: I know. It's possible some of the suspects were indeed innocent. However, it is impossible for us to accurately determine that in every case. All von Karma does is his job, to find the suspect guilty, perfectly. In any case... It's nigh well impossible to find a weakness in him. Should a weakness appear, he would do everything in his power to make it go away. Phoenix: Um, Edgeworth? If what you're saying is true, you're headed for a guilty sentence tomorrow! Maya: H-he's right! Now's no time to be praising the enemy, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Mmph... It's a strange situation in which I find myself, I'll admit. Phoenix: (No kidding.) Present Lake Photo Edgeworth: What are you showing me this picture for? Phoenix: Um, uh, no reason. Edgeworth: ... You know, I was impressed by your deduction in the trial today. Granted, you were at the end of your rope, but still. Maya: Nick, he noticed. Phoenix: Hah hah. DL-6 Case File Edgeworth: ... It was that case that changed my life. And tomorrow, on December 28, its statute of limitations runs out. Phoenix: (Tomorrow... Could that be a coincidence?) Edgeworth: But... even if the case is finally closed on paper... It will never be erased from my memory. Never... Maya: Poor Mr. Edgeworth! DL-6 Incident Photo Maya: N-Nick! No! Th-that's a photo of his father! Don't show him that! Phoenix: (You're right... Now probably isn't a good time to dredge up those old memories...) Edgeworth: What is it? Phoenix: Uh, um, n-nothing. Edgeworth: Huh? Anything else Edgeworth: Sorry. I'm not sure I can help you with that. December 27Gourd Lake ParkEntrance Gumshoe: Hey, pal! Long time no see! Maya: Oh! Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Close one today, eh! I got so worked up, I snapped my tie in half! Phoenix: Uh... Sorry about that. Gumshoe: No prob, pal! Thanks to you, we now know who really did it! Maya: You mean, the boat shop caretaker? Gumshoe: Look, I'll make you a promise. I'll have that scoundrel in my custody by trial time tomorrow! Come what may! It's my duty to you as a police officer! Now, I'm off to catch me a criminal! Maya: ... Detective Gumshoe sure is... active today. Gumshoe: Oh, one other thing! Maya: Eek! Gumshoe: No one can go into the woods today. Maya: The woods? Phoenix: (Where Lotta was camping?) Gumshoe: The woods are off-limits to camping, and apparently the park ranger found out. He got pretty mad. No one can go in for a while. Maya: I guess Lotta's in a 'lotta' trouble... Gumshoe: Anyway, I'll be seeing you tomorrow! December 27Gourd LakePublic Beach Phoenix: Huh? The Steel Eyesore is missing... Maya: \"Eyesore\"!? Phoenix: Looks like the hotdog stand is closed, too. Maya: I guess Larry's too busy worrying about Mr. Edgeworth to show up for work... (Changed from [I guess Larry's been too busy with the trial to show up for work...] in the original release) Examine Lake Maya: This lake sure likes to cause problems, doesn't it. Phoenix: Huh? Maya: I mean, everything that happened here turned out to be a lie! Gourdy was a lie, and the charges against Mr. Edgeworth were all lies. Phoenix: I guess you're right. Maya: I mean, I'm glad the charges were all lies, but still. Trash can Phoenix: A trashcan with no trash. At least the place is well maintained. Bench Maya: No one's going to sit here on a cold day like today. Well, unless they were eating a Samurai Dog! Phoenix: (How would that change the temperature, I wonder?) Maya: ...? You seem troubled, Nick. Phoenix: N-no, who? Me? Stand Phoenix: Guess Larry has today off. Maya: He was pretty happy about saving Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: True. We owe him big. December 27Boat Rental Shop Maya: That old caretaker got away... Phoenix: Yep. Maya: I never imagined he might be the real murderer! ... ???: *Ah-HHHHEM!* Phoenix: ...! (I'd know that clearing-of-the-throat anywhere!) Grossberg: Ah hah, hello! What might you be doing here? Out for a walk, hmm? \"Ahh... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...\" you see. Maya: Mr. Grossberg! This is no time for idle reminiscing! Mr. Edgeworth's trial ends tomorrow! Grossberg: Er... that is true, yes. But, from what I saw of today's trial, Edgeworth should be fine, right? Phoenix: Well... I'm not so sure about that. Grossberg: Ho ho! What do you mean by that? Phoenix: Well... I'm not sure. Grossberg: Hmm... If you find anything out, come by my office at once. I may be able to offer you some assistance. Phoenix: Thanks... (Bye...) Maya: What do you think Mr. Grossberg was doing here anyway? Phoenix: Who knows... Examine Trees Phoenix: There's a forest here beyond these bushes. Maya: Nick! The forest! There's someone in there! Phoenix: ... You're right. There's a few policemen in there. Maya: They must be looking for the caretaker! Phoenix: Good luck... Shop Phoenix: The boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. Maya: The caretaker must have run for the hills, huh? Phoenix: Yeah, looks like it. Maya: He didn't seem like a bad person... December 27Caretaker's Shack Phoenix: ... Maya: Nobody's home. Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Maya: Hey! It's Polly! I wonder where your owner's gone, Polly? Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Maya: I can't believe he'd run off and leave his poor parrot to fend for herself! Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Examine Stove Maya: It doesn't look like he used this kitchen much. Phoenix: You're right. Maya: I guess the whole pasta restaurant thing was a lie. Phoenix: What, you thought he was telling the truth!? Fish pictures Maya: Say, Nick. Don't people usually put pictures of fish up on the wall to boast about them? Phoenix: Uh, yeah, I guess so. You mean picture of the fish they caught, right? Maya: Right... but don't all the fish on the wall here look really puny to you? Phoenix: Well, you know what they say... \"You shoulda seen the one that got away!\" Maya: Except the one that got away from us was the caretaker! And we did see him! Phoenix: (Why do I feel like we're having two different conversations here?) Fishing pole Phoenix: This fishing pole looks expensive. Maya: Maybe we should bring it to Detective Gumshoe. Phoenix: Don't you think the caretaker would mind? Maya: Well, we can just leave him the metal detector in exchange! Phoenix: Uh... maybe we'd better not. Table Phoenix: Hmm. Everything's cold. Looks like he didn't turn his heater on. I guess he hasn't been back here since the trial. Television Maya: Aah! Phoenix: W-what's wrong? Maya: Huh? Oh... N-never mind. Phoenix: What? Tell me! Maya: Just, when I saw the TV, I remembered... They're showing a Pink Princess special this week... Phoenix: ... Oh. Maya: See? That's why I didn't want to tell you. Safe Maya: That reminds me, Nick! Polly here knows the number to this safe, right? Phoenix: Yeah, that's right. Maya: Polly, what's the number to the safe? Parrot: \"1228\"! *squawk* Maya: Let's open it, Nick! C'mon! Phoenix: I'm sure there isn't any money in there. Maya: Aww... But, hey! He keeps it locked, right? So there must be something of value in there! Phoenix: I'm not so sure... Maya: Okay, Nick, let's see what's in there! Phoenix: (I guess there might be a clue or two...) ... The only thing in here is a letter. Maya: A letter? Aww... boring! Phoenix: (Hmm... There's no name or signature on this thing. It's handwritten in very precise, clear letters...) ... \"Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth...\" Edgeworth! Maya: N-N-Nick! Why would Mr. Edgeworth's name be on here...? Phoenix: How should I know!? I'm going to read the whole thing...! \"Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth...\" It also says: \"This is your last chance! Now is the time to get revenge on the two men who ruined your life! (Changed from [Now is your time to get revenge on the two men who ruined your life!] in the original release)\" ... Phoenix: (The rest of the letter goes on to describe the murder plot in detail! How to kill Robert Hammond, and frame Edgeworth... ...Calling Edgeworth out to the lake, getting on the boat... firing twice! This is exactly what I figured out today in court! It's all here... in perfect detail!) ... Maya: What do you think it means, Nick? Phoenix: I don't know... but it looks like these are instructions for that caretaker. When he killed Robert Hammond and called out Edgeworth, he was following instructions! Maya: But who could have written that letter? And... what does it mean, to \"get revenge on Miles Edgeworth\"...? Phoenix: Look, I don't know, okay? But one thing's for certain. This letter is an amazing clue! Letter from the Safe added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Added Letter from the Safe to the Court Record.] in the original release) Safe (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's nothing left in the safe. Maya: I wonder why the caretaker didn't take the letter with him? Phoenix: He left in a hurry, right? I don't think he even came back here after the trial. Parrot Maya: Maybe I should take care of Polly, Nick? Phoenix: You probably shouldn't just kidnap her. The police know about her anyway. I'm sure they'll do something. Maya: Well... okay... Sorry, Polly. He says I can't take you. Phoenix: (Great, now the bird's going to hate me.) Wright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"After the trial\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices and examining safe in Caretaker's Shack) Maya: One day left, Nick. Phoenix: Yeah... I know. Maya: Well, no time to waste! Let's get going! Talk What to do Phoenix: What do you think we should do now, Maya? Maya: You would know best, Nick! Just do what you do! That should work. Any ideas Phoenix: Well? Had any good ideas? Maya: This is all tied to the DL-6 Incident... We'd better find out as much as we can about that murder before tomorrow! Phoenix: (Something that happened back then has a hold on Edgeworth and it won't let go.) Present Anything Maya: Stop showing me stuff and let's get cracking! We only have today to get to the bottom of this! Detention Center Talk Yanni Yogi (after presenting Letter from the Safe) Edgeworth: Yanni Yogi was a court bailiff at the time. We just happened to be in that elevator together 15 years ago. The quake was incredibly strong... Before I knew it, everything was dark. We were there for so long, it felt like forever. The air thinned... and the darkness closed in on us in that little box. We became... unsettled. \"H-help! I can't breathe!\" \"Quiet! I said quiet! You're not making this any easier!\" \"I want to get out! Help! Get us out!\" \"Don't shout! You'll just use up more oxygen!\" \"...!\" Edgeworth: That's all I remember... When I came to, I was in a hospital bed, staring up at the ceiling. In court, Yanni Yogi's mental condition was called into question. They claimed the oxygen deprivation and stress had caused temporary insanity. In the end, the claim passed the court, and Yogi was found innocent. Maya: Huh... But, isn't that strange? This letter tells him to \"get revenge on Edgeworth\"... Why would he want to take revenge on you? Edgeworth: ... Wright. Phoenix: Yeah? Edgeworth: There's something that's been troubling me these last few days. I... didn't know whether or not I should tell you. Phoenix: You mean the nightmare? Edgeworth: It's... a nightmare I've had. A memory of a crime... that I committed. Phoenix: A crime you committed? Edgeworth: ... A memory... of a murder. Edgeworth: I think... I think the time has come to tell all. The nightmare (appears after \"Yanni Yogi\") Edgeworth: For the last 15 years, I've had the same dream almost every night. I wake up in a fearful sweat, every time. Maya: What kind of dream? Edgeworth: It's a dream about my father's killing... in the dark. \"H-help! I can't breathe!\" \"Quiet! I said quiet! You're not making this any easier!\" \"I want to get out! Help! Get us out!\" \"Don't shout! You'll just use up more oxygen!\" \"I... I can't breathe! You... you're using up my air!\" (Changed from [I... I can't breath! [sic] You... you're using up my air!] in the original release) \"Wh-what!?\" \"Stop breathing my air! I'll... I'll stop you!\" \"Aaaah! Wh-what!? What are you...!?\" \"Stop breathing my aaaaair!\" (No! Father! He's attacking Father!) Edgeworth: Then I see the pistol lying by my feet. I don't know if it was evidence from that day in court, or the bailiff's... In a daze, I pick up the pistol... Edgeworth: (Get away...! Get away from my father!) *BANG* Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! Edgeworth: And with that scream... I wake. It's a bone-chilling scream. A scream that has rung in my ears for the past 15 years. Maya: ... B-but... That's just a dream, right? Right? Edgeworth: ... That thought is the only thing that has kept me sane for the last 15 years. But what if I'm wrong? What if it's real? They say that sometimes people shut out memories in self-defense. Maybe it was I who killed my father! Maya: What!? Edgeworth: If you think about it that way, this letter makes sense. \"Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth.\" Think about it. Yogi was really innocent. That's why he wanted revenge against me! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! You... you mean...! Edgeworth: It was me. I was the true criminal of DL-6. I shot my father! Phoenix: This is bad... Maya: What are we doing to do, Nick? What can we do!? Phoenix: I don't know... I don't think there is anything we can do. Like it or not. If there's someone else who knows a lot about the DL-6 Incident, maybe... Maya: ...! There is, Nick! There is someone else who knows about DL-6! Present Letter from the Safe Phoenix: Edgeworth... See this letter? Edgeworth: Hmm? Phoenix: This came out of the safe in the shack where that boat rental caretaker lives. Edgeworth: I see... ...! Revenge... on me? Maya: Who is that old guy, anyway!? Edgeworth: I... I don't know. Phoenix: Could he be an innocent defendant you got declared guilty or something? Edgeworth: Nice, Wright. But I don't remember that old man. Not at all. Maya: So, he was following this letter, then? Edgeworth: Which means there was someone else behind it! \"Now is the time to get revenge on the two men who ruined your life! (Changed from [Now is your time to get revenge on the two men who ruined your life!] in the original release)\" Edgeworth: Two men... meaning myself and Robert Hammond? Maya: It also says: \"This is your last chance!\" Phoenix: Last chance...? Wait, maybe... Maybe he's talking about the statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident! Edgeworth: ... Wait... Wait, that old man...! Maya: Wh-what is it!? Do you know who he is!? Edgeworth: Yogi... Could he be Yogi!? Maya: Yogi? Edgeworth: The suspect in the DL-6 Incident. The one who was found innocent. After clearing \"The nightmare\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: December 27Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: M-Mr. Grossberg! Grossberg: Ah, hello there. What's wrong? You look troubled. Maya: No kidding! I can't believe you're not! Grossberg: M-my my my... Just calm down and tell me what's happened, hmm? Maya: It's M-Mr. Edgeworth! He... He... *sob* Grossberg: I see... So, Edgeworth dreamt he shot his own father? Maya: It's o-only a dream! Only a dream! Grossberg: ... I wonder... Maya: W-what...? Grossberg: If that's the case, then why do you two look so troubled, hmm? Maya: W-well... Grossberg: Also, consider this. Yogi quite certainly holds a deep grudge against Miles Edgeworth. So deep, he'd want to frame him for murder. This leads me to surmise... That Mr. Edgeworth's dream was NOT a dream. It was real. As you imagined. Miles Edgeworth threw the pistol to save his father... the pistol fired... and the deed was done. ... Maya: N... No! I don't believe it! Grossberg: Yogi was suspected of murder, and his career as bailiff was irrevocably wrecked. Thus, he sought revenge on Miles Edgeworth. This was his last chance, of course, with the statute of limitations so close. Talk Gregory Edgeworth Phoenix: What do you know about Edgeworth's father? Grossberg: ... He was a defense attorney without peer. It sounds trite, but it's true. Well, he may have had one peer now that I think about it. Your mentor, Mia Fey. Maya: My sister...? Grossberg: Gregory Edgeworth was very disapproving of Mr. von Karma's techniques. Phoenix: (That's no surprise...) Grossberg: von Karma is an extreme man. Forged testimonies and evidence are nothing to him. The result: he has a perfect win record in court. To beat him, Gregory Edgeworth tried to call attention to his methods. Maya: And...? Grossberg: He lost. And died in despair, as it were. Maya: I see... The spirit medium Grossberg: When Gregory Edgeworth was killed, the police called on a spirit medium. That was your mother, Misty Fey. \"I am Gregory Edgeworth... I have been killed... The one who shot me... was the bailiff... Yanni Yogi.\" Grossberg: Yet Yogi was found innocent. Maya: That's when my mother left us. Everyone called her a fraud. Grossberg: That's right. Everyone thought she was, you see. Yet... now that I think about it. It seem the one who lied was Gregory Edgeworth's ghost... Gregory Edgeworth must have known who shot him. Phoenix: I don't believe it... So you're saying he falsified his \"testimony\"? That Edgeworth's dad lied to protect his son...? Grossberg: It's only a possibility, mind you. But... a possibility nonetheless. Prosecutor von Karma (appears after presenting Letter from the Safe) Grossberg: If it truly was von Karma who wrote this letter, then he would know the truth. He would know that Miles Edgeworth had accidentally killed his own father. Phoenix: ...! Grossberg: He'll say as much tomorrow in court, I should think. He'll press the point until the court finds Miles Edgeworth \"guilty.\" Phoenix: Oh no! Maya: B-but how could von Karma know about Mr. Edgeworth's past like that? Even Mr. Edgeworth thought it was just a nightmare! Grossberg: Hmm... That, I do not know. Yet I do know that von Karma is both persistent... and a perfectionist. He may be seeking to satisfy a grudge against Gregory Edgeworth by hurting his son. Phoenix: What do you mean? Grossberg: It was fifteen years ago... von Karma met Gregory Edgeworth in court, and von Karma did win... But he didn't make it through the trial unscarred. Gregory vs. Manfred (appears after \"Prosecutor von Karma\") Phoenix: What happened in the trial between Edgeworth's dad and von Karma? Grossberg: von Karma got the \"guilty\" verdict he wanted. He won the trial. But Gregory Edgeworth accused von Karma of faulty evidence. And though he lost the trial, Mr. Edgeworth's accusation stood. Maya: Faulty evidence? Grossberg: It was the only penalty von Karma has ever received in his career as a prosecutor. Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow to his perfect trial record. Maya: Wow. Grossberg: It must have been quite a shock for von Karma. He took a vacation for several months after that, you see. Phoenix: A vacation...? Grossberg: Yes, an unusual event for the man. That was the first, and the last vacation he's taken in his many years of prosecuting. Maya: Really!? He doesn't take vacations!? Like... go to the sea, or, uh, to the mountains? Don't tell me he's never been to Europe!? Phoenix: You have strange ideas about vacations, Maya. Grossberg: In any case... That was the only time he took a vacation from work. I believe the penalty upset him quite a lot. Phoenix: (Odd... If he wanted to keep a perfect record so badly... why would he take such a long vacation?) Maya: What do we do, Nick? von Karma is going to bring up DL-6, you can bet on it! What if Mr. Edgeworth pleads guilty to DL-6!? Phoenix: I won't let him! Grossberg: Erm, yes, Mr. Wright... I hate to say this... But even accidental murder is murder, you know. Phoenix: I know that! ... I... I just believe in Edgeworth's innocence! I can't believe he'd kill someone! Maya: B-but, Nick! Mr. Edgeworth admits it himself! His father must have lied to protect him, from beyond the grave... Phoenix: I don't care! I know he's not guilty! Grossberg: ... Mr. Wright... If you say so, I suppose I could go check again. The police files might hold something of interest. Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... thank you! Grossberg: I can't promise anything. In fact, I think the chances of finding something are slim. Phoenix: I understand. (The police materials... hmm.) Present Lake Photo Grossberg: In any case, it's good that the one shooting isn't Miles. Phoenix: You bet it's good! (I can't believe the fiendish planning that went into this murder... And we almost fell right into his trap!) Maya: What a creep! Misty Fey's Photo Grossberg: Ah, she was a beautiful woman... I'm truly sorry about what I did... Maya: Huh? Sorry about what? Grossberg: ... Phoenix: (I think I'll stay out of this one...) DL-6 Case File Grossberg: This incident took place 15 years ago tomorrow. So tomorrow will see the completion of not one, but two trials. All thanks to the statute of limitations. However... I'm afraid the damage the DL-6 Incident has done will never be eased... DL-6 Incident Photo Grossberg: Gregory Edgeworth...? He was a gifted man. His death was truly a loss. I wonder what would have become of von Karma were he alive... Letter from the Safe Grossberg: Oh ho! So this is the letter? It does seem that Yogi was following this letter... when he killed Hammond. Maya: But, why kill Robert Hammond? Grossberg: Hammond was a skilled defense attorney. But... he defended clients not for their sake, but for his own. Phoenix: Huh? His own sake? Grossberg: He never trusted his clients, that one. The only thing he trusted was his own ability. Maya: But, he got his client found innocent. So why should it matter? Grossberg: Actually, my dear, it's quite different. He won that innocent verdict for no one but himself. Yogi was a free man, but socially, he was ruined. Phoenix: (Huh...?) Grossberg: You'll understand soon enough. ... Wait! Phoenix: What is it? Grossberg: This letter... I've seen this handwriting somewhere before... a long time ago! Whose handwriting was this...? Do you have any idea who wrote this? Miles Edgeworth Phoenix: Miles Edgeworth? Grossberg: Wh-wh-whaaat!? Why in heavens would he write something like this!? Why, this letter is an attempt to destroy Miles! Think before you speak, greenhorn! Phoenix: (Uh oh. He's angry.) Grossberg: Think again! Leads back to: \"Do you have any idea who wrote this?\" Yanni Yogi Phoenix: Maybe it was Yanni Yogi? Grossberg: Yanni Yogi!? You claim he wrote himself this letter... then followed his own instructions? Phoenix: Uh... Yeah, I guess that would be what happened. Grossberg: Harumph! Perhaps you think Mr. Yogi has a split-personality, hmm? Phoenix: I think that's definitely a possibility, yes... Grossberg: Hmm... No, I think not. I do not know this Yogi, in any case. There's no way I would recognize his handwriting. Phoenix: Oh, right... Grossberg: Yes, Wright. I'll ask you again. Leads back to: \"Do you have any idea who wrote this?\" Manfred von Karma Leads to: \"Hmm... could it be Manfred von Karma?\" Phoenix: Hmm... could it be Manfred von Karma? Grossberg: von Karma? Why would he have something to do with this? Phoenix: Um, well, I'm not sure... Grossberg: ... Hmm? von Karma... von Karma... W-wait! You're right, my boy! This is von Karma's handwriting, I'm sure of it! I used to see it all the time on court reports... Maya: Whaaaaaat!? But... but that means...! Th-the one who told Mr. Yogi to kill was... Grossberg: Correct. Manfred von Karma, himself! Phoenix: What does this mean, then? Why would von Karma want to frame Edgeworth...? Letter from the Safe (subsequent times) Grossberg: No doubt about it, this is von Karma's handwriting. Yogi was following von Karma's instructions when he killed Hammond. Maya: But, why kill Robert Hammond? Grossberg: Hammond was a skilled defense attorney. But... he defended clients not for their sake, but for his own. Phoenix: Huh? His own sake? Grossberg: He never trusted his clients, that one. The only thing he trusted was his own ability. Maya: But, he got his client found innocent. So why should it matter? Grossberg: Actually, my dear, it's quite different. He won that innocent verdict for no one but himself. Yogi was a free man, but socially, he was ruined. Phoenix: (Huh...?) Grossberg: You'll understand soon enough. ... Now, there's only one question left. Why did von Karma write this? And why now? Anything else Grossberg: Er... quite sorry. I have nothing to say to that. After clearing \"Gregory vs. Manfred\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices: December 27Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Maya: There's hardly anyone here... Phoenix: Everyone must be out looking for the old guy... Yogi. Police: Ah, it's you. I don't think Gumshoe'll be coming back today. He's staying out late looking for someone. Maya: Sounds like Detective Gumshoe is pounding the pavement for real! Um, we were wondering if we could check out the Records Room again... Police: Well, now, I can't have just anyone wandering around in there. But... I guess Mr. von Karma is in there now, anyway. You can go in as long as he's there. Maya: von Karma...? Police: Yes. He just arrived actually. Phoenix: (von Karma's in the Records Room!) Maya: N-Nick! Let's hurry! Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"So, um, what are your hobbies?\" \"Well... I like to do stake-outs now and then...\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for a first date. December 27Police DepartmentRecords Room Maya: Dusty as always! Phoenix: We were only here just yesterday. I'm sure they just haven't had time to clean... ... Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Phoenix: Nothing. I was just noticing that he isn't here. von Karma... Examine Cabinet Phoenix: This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons others... are question marks. Most of it just looks like random junk. Maya: Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for? Phoenix: Don't touch that. It's evidence... Open drawer Leads to: \"Huh? One of the drawers here is open.\" Maya: Huh? One of the drawers here is open. Phoenix: Someone must have been looking in it recently. Maya: The label says, \"Unsolved Cases: Evidence\" Phoenix: Hmm... \"Unsolved cases\"? Maya: Nick! The file for DL-6... it's completely empty! Phoenix: Wh-what!? Karma: What are you doing in here! Maya: Eeek! v-v-von Karma! Karma: You...! ... How do you know my name? Maya: Huh? Karma: Have we met? Maya: W-w-what are you saying!? We see each other every day, don't we? We're Miles Edgeworth's defense team! Karma: Defense team...?  Ahem. I beg your pardon, you see, I rarely remember defense attorneys. They are like bugs to me. Needless things, to be crushed. Phoenix: (I can see how this guy was Edgeworth's mentor.) Examine Open drawer Phoenix: This large drawer is half-open. The label on the drawer reads: \"Unsolved Cases: Evidence.\" All the stuff in here looks like random junk. Only the evidence for the DL-6 Incident is missing. I can guess who took it, too. von Karma. Talk Edgeworth Maya: Uh, umm... Mr. Edgeworth was your student, right? Karma: ... A romanticist who could never shed that veneer of amateurism. Just like his father. Always second rate. Phoenix: Mr. von Karma... You had an axe to grind with Mr. Gregory Edgeworth, didn't you? Karma: Me? A grudge against a mere defense attorney? Why? Phoenix: Because he dealt a blow to your otherwise perfect trial record? Karma: Hmph. Phoenix: So you did... but what I don't get is... Why did you take his son under your wing afterwards? The son of your most bitter rival? Karma: ... That, my dear attorney, is none of your business. Tomorrow's trial Karma: Tomorrow will be the last day of this trial. It's been a while since I've had a defense attorney last this long. Still, you will lose in the end. Miles Edgeworth will admit his own guilt. Phoenix: His guilt of 15 years ago, you mean? Karma: ... You're quite the researcher. If you've done your homework so well, then certainly, you must understand. You know what Miles Edgeworth will tell the court tomorrow. Phoenix: (We were right... So von Karma is going to bring up DL-6 in court tomorrow.) Present Letter from the Safe Leads to: \"Mr. von Karma, have a look at this.\" Anything else Karma: Fool. You think I, a prosecutor, would give you, a defense attorney, information? Bah! Maya: (Creep!) Phoenix: Mr. von Karma, have a look at this. Karma: ... Phoenix: This was you, wasn't it? You instructed Yanni Yogi to commit murder. Karma: ... Yanni Yogi... How many years has it been since I've heard him called by that name. He's a fool. I told him to burn it after he read it. Maya: ...! S-so you admit it! You... you wrote Mr. Yogi this letter! Karma: Yes, my dear defense attorney. Thank you for taking the trouble to bring it to me. You've saved me from a lot of needless hassle. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Maya: N-Nick! What is that thing!? Phoenix: A stun gun. For self defense... usually. Karma: Indeed. 600,000 volts will course through your body like a dog touching an electric fence. Phoenix: Six hundred thous...!? Karma: Oh, don't worry. People don't die from it, usually. Now, give me the letter. Phoenix: (No!!!) Maya: Nooooooooooo! Karma: Whoa! What are you--!? Maya: N-Nick! Run!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: M-Maya! Karma: Out of my way! Phoenix: Waaaaaaaaaaaah! ... ... ... Phoenix: (Ugh... he got us. The letter's... gone, of course. And he took the DL-6 evidence... all of it. Back to having no clues. Wait... Maya jumped first. Maya...! Is she okay? ...) Ma...Maya! Maya: ... Phoenix: Maya! Open your eyes! Maya: ... Phoenix: Maya! Maya: ... The letter! Did he take it? Phoenix: Huh!? Oh... yeah. A-are you okay!? Maya: ... I... I couldn't stop him. I jumped as fast as I could, but one shot from that thing knocked me out cold. I'm useless. I'm not good as a lawyer, or a medium! I can't even call my sister. Not even now, when we need her the most. I wish I hadn't woken up at all. Phoenix: Maya! (Grr! There has to be some way I can help her! I'd better do something about her self-confidence, first.) ...? (Maya... She's holding something! What is that? A bullet?) \"DL-6 Incident, Evidence No. 7 Taken from the heart of Gregory Edgeworth.\" I remember... von Karma was holding this when Maya jumped him. DL-6 Bullet stashed in a pocket. (Changed from [Put DL-6 Bullet in pocket.] in the original release) Phoenix: (I'll prove it to you, Maya. You're most definitely not useless! I'll prove it to you in court tomorrow!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\n-- Who Is Your Owner? --Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk*Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Witness! You can't just say \"hello\" and expect us to get anywhere! I want you to testify! Maya, you talk to her. Maya: R-right! Uh...

Have we forgotten something? Parrot: *squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Phoenix: (If I can get Polly to say that here...! That will prove that the caretaker had something to do with DL-6!) Maya: Um, Polly? Have we forgotten something? Parrot: \"... ... Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Maya: ...! Th-that's not what you're supposed to say! Forgot! Something we forgot! Parrot: \"Hello!

Pol-ly!\" *squawk* Judge: Mr. Wright... I think we've established that this parrot is named \"Polly.\" Does this have anything to do with her owner's identity? Of course Phoenix: Yes it does! Judge: !!! Karma: Hah! Fascinating! You claim that the parrot's name will prove her owner's identity? Then show us this proof! Maya: Nick! Don't you think you're taking the bluffing a little too far? Phoenix: Listen. We've not here to answer the question of \"who is the caretaker.\" We're here to prove that he is Yanni Yogi! All we have to do is tie the name \"Polly\" to Yogi! Your Honor. The proof that the parrot's name reveals the caretaker's identity is... Present DL-6 Case File Phoenix: Judge: The DL-6 Case File? Karma: Karma: That's quite a large file you have there! Which page is this \"proof\" on, then? Show us, or stop wasting our time! Judge: Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, please show us the page. Where in this file is the information connected to this parrot's name? \"Case Summary\" Phoenix: It's on the \"Case Summary\" page! Judge: ... I'm sorry... But I don't see anything here that relates to the name \"Polly.\" At least, not on this page. Karma: Hmph! A bluff! As I expected! Judge: I'm afraid I have to deny your claim, Mr. Wright.

He looks totally different!Phoenix: This is the real Yogi, I think. Finally. He's been acting feeble to hide his true identity. Acting... for 15 years!Judge: W-well...! Let me ask you again. Please state your name for the court!Yogi: My name... is Yanni Yogi. 15 years ago, I served as a bailiff in this very court.Judge: Order! Order! Yanni Yogi! So was it you who killed Robert Hammond...? And tried to frame Miles Edgeworth for his death?Yogi: ... Yes.  It was me. I did it. ... They put me on the witness stand 15 years ago... Robert Hammond... he said I was mentally unsound. He told me it would make me innocent. Get me off the hook. So... I pretended to have brain damage... I was innocent, really! But he didn't believe me! We won the trial... But I lost everything. I lost my job, my fianc\u00e9e, my social standing... ([fianc\u00e9e] not accented in the original release) ... Then, this year, 15 years later... A package arrived. It was a letter... and a pistol. The plan was written out in careful detail. It was a plan for me to take my revenge on the people who ruined my life. I didn't care who had sent it. I thought this was my chance, after 15 years, this was it! Finally, a chance to have my revenge on Robert Hammond and Miles Edgeworth... I have no regrets.Judge: W-wait a moment! Revenge... against Miles Edgeworth? What do you mean?Yogi: I'm not at liberty to speak on that matter. Why don't you ask Mr. Edgeworth yourself? Anyway, I admit it, I was the one who killed Robert Hammond.Judge: von Karma... Where is Mr. Yogi?Karma: Under arrest, Your Honor. I saw no room for error in his confession.Judge: Then... the defendant, Miles Edgeworth is...Karma: Innocent. In this case, at least.Judge: Hmm. Very well. Will the defendant please take the stand?Judge: There are a few mysteries left unsolved. Still, you are cleared of suspicion for this particular case. So I would like to pass judgment on the murder of Mr. Robert Hammond. Any objections?Phoenix: ...Edgeworth: ...Karma: ...Phoenix: (I don't believe it! Why isn't von Karma saying anything?)Judge: Very well. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...Not GuiltyJudge: That is all. The court is adjourned!Edgeworth:Judge: D-did someone just say \"objection\"?Phoenix: (It wasn't von Karma...! Wait, but that means...) No... Edgeworth!?Edgeworth: Your Honor. I object to your judgment.Judge: Wh-what do you mean?Edgeworth: I'm not innocent at all! As we have heard, Yanni Yogi killed Robert Hammond in revenge. But, revenge for what?Maya: Nick! Edgeworth is trying to confess! He's going to say he's guilty! He's going to tell them he was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident! He's going to tell them he killed his own dad!Phoenix: (Uh oh! What do I do?)Raise an objection Phoenix: Phoenix: The judgment has already been passed! I object to Edgeworth's outburst... Karma: Karma: Didn't something like this happen yesterday, too? I believe a certain witness raised an objection after a guilty verdict was passed. Phoenix: (That would be Larry...) Karma: We must hear this new statement! We must hear Miles Edgeworth! Judge: He's right. We have a duty to hear Mr. Edgeworth out. Leads to: \"For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream.\"Leave it to Edgeworth Phoenix: (No... I'm sure Edgeworth thought about this one long and hard. This isn't my place to interfere!) Maya: Nick, are you sure!? Phoenix: There's nothing we can do about it. This is his problem, now. Leads to: \"For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream.\"Edgeworth: For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I know, it wasn't a dream. Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer.Judge: You mean... in the incident where your father died?Edgeworth: From the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the DL-6 Incident... It was me! Your Honor! I confess my guilt! I am guilty for DL-6, the statute of limitations of which ends today! The culprit... is me!Judge: Order! Order! This is certainly unexpected! The defendant, declared innocent, is confessing to a different crime! A crime for which the statute of limitations runs out today! I'm not really sure how I should deal with this...Karma: Bah! It's obvious. We hold a trial. Right here. Right now. We try this man for his crime of fifteen years ago!Judge: I think... I think I would like to take a five-minute recess. During this time, I will consider the appropriate course of action to take. Court is adjourned!December 28, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Edgeworth: I'm sorry, Wright. I've just wasted all of your effort.Gumshoe: ... Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, sir! (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, pal!] in the original release) I mean, you... kill your dad?Edgeworth: I didn't want to believe it myself, Detective! But... it's the truth. I deserve to be punished. Murder is murder, no matter what the circumstances.Gumshoe: This is crazy! Just crazy!Maya: ... ...? Nick? What are you doing?Phoenix: Huh? Oh... I was just reading through the Court Record once more. I'm getting my case ready.Maya: Your case... for what?Phoenix: Huh? Isn't it obvious? I'm going to prove that Miles Edgeworth is innocent.Gumshoe: ...! Wh-what are you talking about, pal! He just admitted to it! He confessed that he did it! In court!Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth. But I don't believe in your \"nightmare.\"Edgeworth: Wh-what!?Phoenix: It's just a dream. It's not real. The truth is right here in this Court Record. In any case, tighten your belts. The real fight is just beginning. I'll prove you're innocent. Trust me.Edgeworth: W-Wright...December 28, 2:30 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge: Now then, I would like to resume our trial. (Changed from [Then, I would like to resume our trial.] in the original release)Karma: Judge! Miles Edgeworth has admitted his own guilt. He has confessed his crime. Let us begin by hearing his testimony. Then, though pointless, let the defense do their cross-examining. The statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident runs out today. Though it's unconventional for me, I'd like to run this one by the book.Judge: I see. Does the defense have any objections?Phoenix: No, Your Honor. (von Karma... you knew this was going to happen from the very beginning, didn't you!)Judge: Very well. Will Miles Edgeworth take the stand?Karma: Will the witness state his name and profession.Edgeworth: Miles Edgeworth... I am a prosecuting attorney.Karma: Mr. Edgeworth. Fifteen years ago, you mistakenly killed your father, Gregory Edgeworth. Is this correct?Edgeworth: ... It is correct.Karma: Then testify about this matter to the court.Phoenix: (When Edgeworth was telling me about his dream yesterday I noticed something... One detail didn't quite fit. That will be the key... but only if I can get it to work!)Maya: Please... Please...Witness Testimony-- The DL-6 Incident --Edgeworth: That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials. As we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator. My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue. Just then, something heavy fell at my feet. I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting. A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream. It was a terrible scream. I remember it to this day. That's all.Judge: Hmm... And, until now, you thought this memory was a \"dream\"?Edgeworth: We were stuck in that elevator for five hours. The oxygen in the elevator ran out, and I lost my memory of the events.Karma: Bah! The same claim Mr. Yogi has made!Judge: Very well. Mr. Wright? Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The DL-6 Incident --Edgeworth: That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What was the trial your father was involved in on that day? Edgeworth: I don't remember things very clearly. Only two things... I know my father lost, and Mr. von Karma was the prosecuting attorney. Judge: Mr. von Karma? You were handling that case? Karma: It was fifteen years ago. I don't remember the details. Phoenix: (That was when Edgeworth pointed out the problem in von Karma's evidence...)Edgeworth: As we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, there were three people including yourself trapped in that elevator? Edgeworth: Yes. Myself, my father, and Yanni Yogi. We were fine at first... But then as time passed, and no one came to help...Edgeworth: My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What did you do then? Edgeworth: I was a nine-year-old boy at the time. What could I do? I was scared... Trembling, in the corner. But then...Edgeworth: Just then, something heavy fell at my feet.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What was it? Edgeworth: A pistol. I assume it was the bailiff, Yanni Yogi's. The safety must have come off when it fell from his holster. Karma: And you picked it up. What happened next?Edgeworth: I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you know it was a pistol when you threw it? Edgeworth: I think I knew. I knew it was dangerous. But... the air was getting so thick. I panicked. Karma: So, you're saying that you threw the pistol at Mr. Yogi. Edgeworth: I was... in a daze.Edgeworth: A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The gun fired once? Edgeworth: Yes... I think... after I threw it, I lost consciousness. Since then... They've echoed in my head, every day. That gunshot, and that horrible scream. Phoenix: The scream...Present DL-6 Case File Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure you only heard one gunshot? Edgeworth: Yes. I'm sure of that. I heard the shot, and the scream... Then everything faded. I was unconscious until the rescuers came. Judge: I see... Phoenix: No, Your Honor, unfortunately, you don't. (Changed from [But that doesn't make sense!] in the original release) Look at this file one more time. This plainly contradicts the witness's testimony. Karma: Karma: You do enjoy dragging out that file, don't you? I don't accept this evidence! Unless... you can tell us what page it's on! Which page contradicts Miles Edgeworth's testimony? \"Case Summary\" Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Looks like your luck has run out. Judge: Mr. Wright... This page has no contradictions that I can see!

Even my grandchild could do better than you! Leads back to: \"Which page contradicts Miles Edgeworth's testimony?\" Phoenix: Look at the \"Victim Data\" in this file! It says quite plainly: \"the murder weapon was fired twice\"! Miles Edgeworth only heard one gunshot! Yet, the murder weapon was fired twice! The first shot was the accidental firing when the pistol was thrown. So... who fired the remaining shot!? Judge: Hmm... Was there, perhaps, another shooter who fired that second shot? Karma: Karma: Your Honor. As I'm sure you're aware... This incident occurred fifteen years ago. The evidence is dated... The pistol did fire twice. However, we do not know WHEN that second shot was fired. It might have been fired the day before the incident! There is no proof that the second shot had anything to do with this incident! Phoenix: (What...!) Judge: Hmm... I see, I see. You do have a point. Mr. Wright? The murder weapon was fired twice, as we have heard. One of those shots was fired by the defendant, a boy at the time. Do you have any proof that the other shot fired had something to do with the case? Yes Leads to: \"Your Honor. I think I will be able to show you proof.\" No Phoenix: (Grr... I didn't think of that.) I, uh, don't have proof. Karma: Hah! As I suspected! Judge: Hmm... Given that all this happened fifteen years ago, it's doubtful any proof remains. Maya: Nick! Take a look at this! Phoenix: The Court Record...? Maya: Look... doesn't this make you think... Phoenix: Wh-whoa! (She's right! That is strange!) Leads to: \"Your Honor. I think I will be able to show you proof.\" Phoenix: Your Honor. I think I will be able to show you proof. Karma: Wh-what!? Impossible! Judge: Now, now, Mr. von Karma. Save your surprise for after you've seen the evidence. Very well, Mr. Wright. Show us your proof. Do you have evidence that the second firing of the pistol is related to this incident? Present DL-6 Incident Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Look at this photograph.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Mr. Wright... Please, think how we feel having to look at this evidence time and time again. Every time you show us ridiculous evidence, I feel, well, mocked. Phoenix: Hah hah... Uh, I mean, I really don't mean any harm by it, Your Honor. Judge: \"Not meaning any harm\"... and \"not doing any harm\" are two different things, Mr. Wright. Try again, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"Do you have evidence that the second firing of the pistol is related to this incident?\" Phoenix: Look at this photograph. Judge: This is a photograph of the scene of the crime, fifteen years ago. I can see that the victim lying there is Gregory Edgeworth... Phoenix: This proves the murder weapon was fired twice, at the time of the incident! This photo proves it! Karma: ... Judge: ... So, let me get this straight. This photo proves two shots were fired? Where? Phoenix: (Y-Your Honor, please... Please get a clue! Show the judge the contradiction in the photo!) Present bullet hole Phoenix: Leads to: \"As should be obvious, the contradiction is here.\" Present Gregory Edgeworth's body Phoenix: Phoenix: It's here... I think. Judge: You mean the victim... Gregory Edgeworth? Gregory Edgeworth was shot once... and he died, as we can see here. What's strange about that? Phoenix: (Er... Maybe I need to be more specific here.) Judge: Once more, please! Leads back to: \"Show the judge the contradiction in the photo!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, I think... it's here! Judge: ... Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Yes? Judge: Your eyes have a habit of shifting back and forth when you're uncertain. Try taking a deep breath, and think this over once more. Phoenix: R-right, Your Honor. Leads back to: \"Show the judge the contradiction in the photo!\" Phoenix: As should be obvious, the contradiction is here. Judge: I see... a bullet hole in the door... Phoenix: Your Honor! Gregory Edgeworth was killed by a shot from the pistol! Yet, there is also a bullet hole in the elevator door! We also know that the murder weapon was fired twice! Thus... Someone other than Edgeworth fired that second shot! Leads to: \"O-order! Order!\"Present DL-6 Incident Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: So, there was only one gunshot? Edgeworth: Yes. I'm sure of that. I heard the shot, and the scream... Then everything faded. I was unconscious until the rescuers came. Judge: I see. Phoenix: No, Your Honor, unfortunately, you don't. (Changed from [It must have been scary.] in the original release) Karma: ... Phoenix: Take a look at this. This is a photograph of the scene of the crime, fifteen years ago. And in it, lies a clear contradiction to Mr. Edgeworth's testimony. Judge: Well, I can see the victim, Gregory Edgeworth, lying there... But what do you mean, a \"contradiction\"?

Leads back to: \"Show the judge the contradiction in the photo!\" Phoenix: As should be obvious, the contradiction is here. Judge: I see... a bullet hole in the door... Phoenix: Your Honor! Miles Edgeworth testifies that there was only one gunshot! However, according to this photograph, not one, but two shots were fired! One shot hit the victim, the other hit the elevator door. I ask you, then! Why did Miles Edgeworth only hear one gunshot? Karma: Karma: This photograph does seem to confirm a second shot. However, when was the hole in the elevator made? It might have been there before the incident occurred! If it was there before, it has nothing to do with this incident! Phoenix: Urk... Karma: Mr. Wright! Do you have any proof that this bullet hole was caused at the time of the incident!? Yes Leads to: \"Your Honor. I think I will be able to show you proof.\" No Phoenix: (Grr...

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given scenario. The testimonies are from Edgeworth regarding the DL-6 incident. \n\nLooking at the testimonies, the key one here is Testimony 5 where Edgeworth says there was a single gunshot. However, the DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) states that the murder weapon was fired twice. Also, the DL-6 Incident Photo (Evidence 19) shows a bullet hole in the elevator door, indicating a second shot. So Edgeworth's claim of hearing only one gunshot contradicts the evidence showing two shots were fired.\n\nBut wait, the user provided a list of evidence and testimonies. Let me cross-check. Testimony 5 is about a single gunshot. The DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) says the pistol was fired twice. That's a direct contradiction. So the evidence would be 18 and the testimony is 5."

Let our members discuss this matter with a clear conscience of the Goddess of Law! Today's deliberation shall be about... Miles Edgeworth's aptitude and ability as a prosecutor! Kay: Wh-Who are you...? Why are you wearing that raincoat...? Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhh! April 5, 1:23 PMHigh Prosecutors' OfficesRoom 1202 Examine evidence Front side of Prosecutor's Badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back side of Prosecutor's Badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! Edgeworth: Calm down. You're getting dust everywhere. Gumshoe: I've already cleaned this room three times since this morning! Edgeworth: Well, now you'll need to do it a fourth time. Gumshoe: You're way too calm, sir! What if they actually take your badge!? Edgeworth: A decision has not yet been made. Gumshoe: But it looks like it's pretty much decided! Don't you remember what Judge Gravelle said!? Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth, the P.I.C. has you in its sights. They will receive a report on everything you did here today... ...and you will most likely be required to appear before them. Edgeworth: I have been ordered to attend the meeting. ...That's all. Gumshoe: I hate this, sir! I won't be able to work with you anymore! Edgeworth: As a detective, perhaps you should welcome this turn of events. You would no longer have to work with such a troublesome prosecutor as myself. Gumshoe: Wh-Why would you say something like that, sir...? The problem is with the P.I.C. and their false accusations... Mr. Edgeworth... Don't tell me... you actually want to become a defense attorney? Edgeworth: ...... Gumshoe: B-Because you can't do that! Being a prosecutor is exactly what makes you Prosecutor Edgeworth, sir! Edgeworth: (...A defense attorney, huh? I became a prosecutor because of the incident where I lost my father... However, the reason I became interested in the legal world... ...was because my father who passed away... had been a defense attorney.) Ray: To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on. Gumshoe: Are you listening, sir!? I don't like this one bit! Edgeworth: There is no need for you to be so pessimistic. Maybe my replacement will be more lenient during your salary assessments. Gumshoe: A-Ah, I see... That way, I can eat more than just instant noodles every day...! Wait, what am I saying!? That's not the point here! Edgeworth: (He was... actually imagining it.) Gumshoe: We're busy right now! Come back later, pal! ???: Paging Mr. Edgeworth. Is there a Mr. Miles Edgeworth here? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth is busy now! I'll listen to whatever you have to say later, pal! ???: Hrmm... This isn't good! Your face has become all red. Errrm... A red face, a red face... Gumshoe: Umm, like I said, we're kind of busy right now, so... ???: I've got it! You have a tummy ache, right!? This calls for an injection, stat! Please roll up your sleeves! Gumshoe: Aiiieeeee! Nonono, I'm perfectly healthy! Edgeworth: ...Who might you be? Karin: Aaaah, I'm so sorry! I forgot to introduce myself! My name is Karin Jenson. I am a registered nurse at the Dye-Young Hospital. Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but nobody here is sick. You must have the wrong room. Karin: Are you Mr. Miles Edgeworth? You have such great wrinkles between your brow... Could it be lupus? This calls for an injection... Edgeworth: I-It's not lupus! Just tell me what business you have with me! Karin: Ahh. Yes, yes. Actually, there's someone who would like to see you. Please wait a moment. I'll call them here right now! Edgeworth: Wait! Gumshoe: She left, sir. I wonder who she's going to bring. Hmm, if she's bringing someone from the hospital... Could it be a patient, sir? Maybe it's someone who was traumatized by your harsh words... Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Gumshoe: S-See? When you glare at me like that, it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack. You could send someone to the hospital with that... Edgeworth: (I-Is it really that bad...? I'm just being my normal self, though.) Karin: Sorry for the wait! Well, what do you think? ???: ........ Edgeworth: What do I think...? ???: Umm... Do you not recognize me? Edgeworth: (Now that she mentions it, I feel like I've met her before...) ???: Umm... this card... Your name was written on it... Do you know who I am? Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Maybe you really did send her to the hospital... Edgeworth: Of course not! Gumshoe: But this is your business card, sir. It clearly says... \"Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth\". Edgeworth: Umm. Th-That's true... ???: I-I am terribly sorry... I'm, umm, well... Karin: The truth is, this girl... suffers from memory loss. Gumshoe: M... Memory loooosss? ???: Yes... That seems to be the case. Karin: Ahh... Her parents should be worried sick right now... They probably haven't been able to sleep. I doubt they've gotten more than 8 hours... Edgeworth: (Isn't that plenty of sleep?) Gumshoe: I see. It sure sounds horrible... but it's alright now! Since she has that business card, she must be an acquaintance of Mr. Edgeworth's. Just leave her to us, pal! Right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed... We might be able to verify her identity, at least. ???: Would you... really do that for me? Edgeworth: First, I'd like you to tell us everything that you know. Gumshoe: That's our Mr. Edgeworth! You have nothing to worry about now, Miss! Edgeworth: (Good grief...) Mysterious girl Leads to: \"(But still, where to begin? What should I ask her first...?)\" Present Anything ???: ...I am terribly sorry. Even if you give me that, I still don't remember anything about you. Edgeworth: N-No... I wasn't planning on giving it to you... Edgeworth: (But still, where to begin? What should I ask her first...?) Gumshoe: Miss. Do you remember your name? ???: My name...... I am terribly sorry. Karin: She's been like this ever since yesterday, y'know? Edgeworth: ...Hmm. So you found her yesterday. Karin: Wooow! That's amazing! How'd you know!? Edgeworth: (Wh... What a tiresome woman...) Karin: I found her stumbling around late last night, so I took her in. I wanted to help her out, so I looked through her things. Edgeworth: So, that's how you found my business card. Did she have anything else with her? Karin: Nothing to reveal her name or address... Ah! But! She was wearing this when I found her. It's an unusual design, don't you think? Edgeworth: Wha... Th-This badge is... Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaat! Th-The Yatagarasu's...! That means... I-I-It couldn't be! Edgeworth: Are you Kay!? ???: Kay......? Yatagarasu's Badge data jotted down in my Organizer. Your name Edgeworth: You are... Kay, right? Kay: I am... Kay...... Gumshoe: Kay! Don't you remember me!? I mean, you'd always call me \"Gummy\", pal! Kay: G-Gummy... I would call one of my elders something so rude...? Aaah... I'm so sorry! What a horrible thing I did...! I feel like my heart is going to burst from guilt! Gumshoe: Just...... Just what happened to you, pal! You've become so sensitive! If you're this sensitive, and delicate, and frail... ...then you're not even Kay anymore! You're someone else, pal! Edgeworth: Watch your words, Detective. If you say that... ...it almost sounds like Kay isn't sensitive or delicate at all. (Though I can't deny there is some truth to what he says.) Kay: Umm... What sort of person was I... before I lost my memory? Gumshoe: Well, for starters, your name was Kay Faraday. A cheerful girl full of spirit and vigor, and a Great Thief. Kay: Great Thief...? Edgeworth: Yes. To put it frankly... ...a Great Thief steals valuables from people's drawers and safes... Kay: St........Steal!! I caused so much trouble for others? Ahh... I'm so sorry! I never imagined I would be a criminal...! Maybe losing my memory was retribution for my crimes... Edgeworth: No, you didn't actually... Gumshoe: Uuugghh... This is so messed up, sir... Karin: But it does sort of make sense, y'know. These gloves and stuff, they look just like what a thief might wear. Gumshoe: Ah! Those clothes! Karin: Yes. She was wearing them when I found her. I had her change her clothes, so I'm holding onto them for now... Edgeworth: Hmm...? Something appears to be stuck on her clothes. Perhaps it has something to do with Kay's memory loss? Gumshoe: I'll send it down to the lab later and have them check it out, sir! Edgeworth: Good. I will be counting on you, Detective Gumshoe. Karin: At any rate... these really look like a thief's clothes, don't they! Kay: I-I am... a criminal... Edgeworth: It's true you were a Great Thief, but never once did you commit a crime. That alone I can assure you. Kay: ...Is that... so...? Edgeworth: (It's probably better if I don't press this issue any further.) Memory loss Leads to: \"...I'm really sorry. For not remembering you.\" Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: Is that a badge... for protecting someone? Like a badge worn by a hero of justice... right? Edgeworth: No... This is called a Prosecutor's Badge. I think what you're referred to would be a defense attorney's badge, right? Kay: I wonder...? This badge... makes me feel really nostalgic. As if someone really dear to me showed it to me a lot... Edgeworth: (Kay's father was a prosecutor. Perhaps little bits of her childhood memories still remain.) Yatagarasu's Badge Kay: Do you like badges, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Hmm. Not particularly. Kay: But you are always carrying around badges. Edgeworth: It is just a part of my job. And this badge is also a piece of evidence... Kay: I see. So you carry around things that you don't like in order to train and strengthen your spirit! Edgeworth: ...That is just clearly wrong. Examine evidence Front side of Yatagarasu's Badge Edgeworth: This is the badge that Kay is always wearing. It's emblazoned with the mark of the Yatagarasu and it really stands out. I doubt there are any thieves who would actually wear it. Kay: ...I'm really sorry. For not remembering you. Umm... What kind of relationship did we have? Edgeworth: Hmm. Well, that's... (Rather difficult to explain.) Gumshoe: Kay, you were... Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! Kay: Oh my! So then, a prosecutor is the kingpin of a Great Thief? Gumshoe: Uh, no... That's not what I meant, pal... Edgeworth: (The last time I met \"Kay\" was the day before yesterday... Just what did she do from then up until now...?) Ms. Jenson, was the badge the only thing this girl had on her? Karin: She did have some other things, but I don't think they will be very helpful at all. Edgeworth: I don't mind. Please show them to me. Karin: Well then, I'll give them to you one by one, OK! Gumshoe: This is a Jammin' Ninja mask. Maybe she went to a superhero show or something? Edgeworth: Hmm. This seems to be a letter addressed to Kay. This is a ticket stub. And this is... Gumshoe: ...a flower made of cloth! Like the ones you usually see in restrooms, sir! Edgeworth: ...A corsage. It is used primarily as an accessory for women. Karin: Well, that's everything. Did you find anything out? Gumshoe: Umm, not really. They were just a bunch of random things. Edgeworth: (I'll have to look them over in more detail later.) Jammin' Ninja Mask data jotted down in my Organizer. Letter jotted down in my Organizer. Ticket Stub data jotted down in my Organizer. Purple Flower data jotted down in my Organizer. Gumshoe: Ooh.... This is horrible! Kay's lost her memory! How do we get her back to normal!? Edgeworth: Calm down, Detective. I have already thought of something. Gumshoe: Oh! As I would expect of Mr. Edgeworth! So, what did you find out, sir? Edgeworth: Look at this ticket stub. Karin: Oh, it's a ticket for the viewing platform of the Bigg Building! Gumshoe: Umm, Ms. Nurse? Do you know something about the Bigg Building? Karin: Of course I do! It's a super famous dating spot, after all! They say that if a couple holds hands up there, they will be together forever... Tee hee. Edgeworth: The time stamp on the ticket is from yesterday. Moreover, it is only valid on the day of issue. Gumshoe: Since she only has the stub... she must have used it, right? Edgeworth: It is very likely. ...Well then, let's go. Gumshoe: Ehh! Right now, sir? Edgeworth: The cause of Kay's memory loss is hidden in her actions. Gumshoe: B-But... What about the P.I.C.!? Edgeworth: It's still too early for me to be summoned there. Karin: Errrm... So, should I leave Kay with you, then? Edgeworth: That is what I would prefer. Kay, you're fine with that, right? Kay: Ah... Yes, please! Thank you very much! Karin: Well, I have to get back to work, so if anything happens, please contact the Dye-Young Hospital. If you guys need an injection, I'll be there anytime, please! Edgeworth: Yes. I understand. (I don't think I will call her for an injection, though.) Well then. Let's go, Detective. ...And you too, Kay. Gumshoe: Yessir! Kay: Thank you... for helping me. April 5, 2:07 PMOutside Bigg BuildingTower Plaza Gumshoe: Umm. According to the pamphlet... ...this building is 50 stories tall. It's mostly filled with offices though... Only the viewing platform is open to the public. Here you go, sir. I just got this at the reception desk. Edgeworth: Good. Thank you. Bigg Building Pamphlet data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Well then, let us head inside immediately... Eeeek! The Bigg Building... The Bigg Building is collapsing! Edgeworth: Hm! Gumshoe: Wh-What!? ???: No, you can't! Please stop! Please... I beg of you! Ugh, it's no good. Unless I drink fresh milk, my thoughts just won't reach...! Gumshoe: What's wrong, pal!? Did something happen at the Bigg Building!? Cuuuuuut! Cut, cut, cut, cuuuut! ???: E-Excuse me! We're sort of in the middle of shooting a movie, and umm... Edgeworth: (...Hmph. I suspected as much.) We are sorry for any trouble we've caused you. ...Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I-I'm so sorry, pal! I really thought the tower was gonna collapse or something... ???: Whatever... Hey, director! I'm taking a break. ???: I'm sorry... I'm really, really sorry! Kay: What a relief... It looks like the tower's collapse was prevented somehow. Edgeworth: (Explaining all this to Kay as she is now would take more time than it's worth...) Well then. We should get going. April 5, 2:18 PMBigg BuildingViewing Platform Gumshoe: Wow, what a view! I bet I can see my house from here! Kay: Eek...! Th-The wind... is really strong up here. Gumshoe: Everything should be fine as long as you stay close to me and Mr. Edgeworth, pal. If you start to blow away, one of us will be sure to catch you! Edgeworth: (It's not as if she's a kite!) Kay, do you recognize this place? Kay: ...I-I don't know. Was I... really here? Edgeworth: (Maybe if I get her to talk a bit, it will help jog her memory...) Kay. Just tell me whatever you remember. Anything will do. Kay: O-OK. But I don't know how much help I'll be... -- Memories of the Tower -- Kay: Did I... really come to a place like this? It's so high up, and the wind is so strong... It's frightening. ...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all... .....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible. Gumshoe: Hmm. Her memory isn't clearing up at all, huh? Kay: ...I'm so sorry. It's a bit pathetic, isn't it? You are both going out of your way for me, but I'm not helping at all. Edgeworth: You're doing just fine. You have memory loss, after all. Gumshoe: Alright, Mr. Edgeworth! Remember to go easy on her, sir. Normally, you have this really intense and kind of scary look on your face. Edgeworth: (...You're not helping, Detective.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This ticket stub proves that you were indeed here. Kay: But I really don't remember coming here at all. I don't think I would want to come to a place like this. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You used to love places like these, though. Kay: Was that... really me? We're so high up... Just looking down makes me dizzy. I think these kinds of places should be shut down. What if an elderly person or a small child were to fall off...! Edgeworth: The railing here is quite high. I think your worries are unfounded. Kay: ...Is that so...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you don't remember anything... In that case, is there anything that looks familiar? Kay: Looks familiar? Umm....... Ah! The cherry tree! Edgeworth: What about the cherry tree? Kay: I was standing under that cherry tree... That's right, I was taking shelter from the rain because it was raining then... And there... A red... I saw... something red... Edgeworth: (Hmm. She was under the cherry tree while it rained... And... from there she saw something red...) Kay: Umm, is something wrong...? Edgeworth: It's nothing. Could you add that last part to your story? Change this statement to: \"But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: A red... what exactly? Kay: A red... something or other. It was something red. That's... all I can remember about it. Edgeworth: (Speaking of things that are red here...) Could it be that stand over there? Kay: Stand... A red... stand... ...Ahh, that's right! I saw someone walking towards me from the other side of that stand. Edgeworth: And then what happened? Kay: And then... Umm... .....I'm sorry. Edgeworth: It's alright. Simply add everything you just said to your story. Change this statement to: \"Umm... That's right, someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By that stand, do you mean the stand directly behind you? Kay: Yes. From behind that red stand, someone came walking towards me... I saw it from under the cherry tree. Edgeworth: You've been saying that you saw \"someone\"... Does that mean you didn't see their face? Or was it a person you didn't know? Kay: .....I'm sorry. That much, I don't know. Edgeworth: (So \"someone\" came walking towards her from behind the red stand... ...and she saw that from beneath the cherry tree.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is there nothing else that comes to mind? It doesn't have to be related to the case. Kay: Even if it's not related.....? Umm... Well... Ah... I remember that the stand there was selling cotton candy. Edgeworth: ...If you're hungry, you should just say so. Gumshoe: I'll make sure to buy one for you later, pal! Kay: ...Thank you very much. I look forward to it. Edgeworth: (There's not much I can do unless I can draw out more information from her...

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the given information. The user provided the story, characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to identify one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nFirst, let's go through the testimonies given by Kay. The testimonies are:\n\n0. Did I... really come to a place like this?\n1. It's so high up, and the wind is so strong... It's frightening.\n2. ...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all...\n3. But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.\n4. Umm... That's right, someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand.\n5. .....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences, particularly the Bigg Building Pamphlet (Evidence 7). The pamphlet's description mentions that on the viewing platform, the left-most edge has a cherry tree and the right-most edge has a candy stand. \n\nIn Testimony 3, Kay says she saw something red from under the cherry tree. Then in Testimony 4, she mentions someone coming from the other side of that stand. According to the pamphlet, the stand is on the right-most edge, while the cherry tree is on the left. If Kay was under the cherry tree (left side), the stand (right side) would be on the opposite side. Therefore, if she saw someone coming from the other side of the stand (right side), she would have to be looking across the platform. However, the \"something red\" she saw from under the cherry tree (left) would actually be the stand, which is red. But if the stand is on the right, and she's on the left, then the stand would be across from her. \n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is that Kay says she saw someone coming from behind the stand (right side) while she was under the cherry tree (left). The stand is red, as per the pamphlet. So Testimony 3 says she saw something red from under the cherry tree, which would be the stand. But if she saw someone coming from behind the stand (the red stand), then that's possible. But perhaps there's an inconsistency here. Wait, maybe the problem is that the stand is red, so Testimony 3 is her saying she saw something red (the stand) from under the cherry tree. But if she was under the cherry tree (left), the red stand is on the right, so she could see it. However, Testimony 4 says someone came from the other side of that stand. So if the stand is on the right, then the \"other side\" would be the right side beyond the stand, which would be the edge of the building. That might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the stand is between her and the person approaching. Wait, the pamphlet's description says the cherry tree is left-most and the stand is right-most. So if she's at the cherry tree (left), the stand is on the right. So someone coming from the other side of the stand (from the right side beyond the stand) would be approaching from the right edge. But the stand itself is red, so Testimony 3 (saw something red from under the cherry tree) would refer to the stand. But the person coming from behind the stand (Testimony 4) would be from the right edge. However, the problem might be that if she was under the cherry tree, she would see the stand on the right. If the person came from behind the stand (the right side), then Kay would have seen them approaching from the stand's direction, which is red. But perhaps the contradiction is that the stand is red, so Testimony 3's \"something red\" is the stand, but Testimony 4 says someone came from the other side of the stand, implying that the stand was between her and the person. But according to the pamphlet's layout, the stand is on the right, and the cherry tree is on the left. Therefore, if Kay was under the cherry tree (left), the stand is on the right. If someone came from behind the stand (right edge), then they would be approaching from the right, which is the same side as the stand. So Testimony 3 (saw something red) would be the stand, and Testimony 4 (someone from behind the stand) would align. Hmm, maybe not a contradiction here.\n\nWait, maybe another angle. Let's check Evidence 7's description again: \"On a top-down view of the viewing platform on the roof, to the left-most edge is a cherry tree. To the right-most edge is a candy stand.\" So the cherry tree is left, stand is right. If Kay was under the cherry tree (left), then the stand is on the opposite side (right). If she saw someone coming from the other side of the stand (right side beyond the stand), that would mean the person was coming from the right edge. But the stand is red, so when she says she saw something red (Testimony 3), that's the stand. But the person comes from behind the stand (Testimony 4). So that's possible. Maybe there's no contradiction here.\n\nWait, maybe another evidence. The Magenta Flower (Evidence 6) is a corsage torn from the victim's clothes. If Kay's testimony mentions seeing something red (Testimony 3), but the corsage is magenta, which is a different color. However, the stand is red. So perhaps if the corsage was supposed to be red but is magenta, that's a discrepancy. But in the evidence list, Evidence 6 is the Magenta Flower. So if Kay said she saw something red (Testimony 3), but the corsage is magenta, that's a contradiction. However, the stand is red, so that's a separate item. Alternatively, the Ringleader's Appearance (Evidence 16) mentions a magenta flower. But Kay saw something red. If the flower was magenta, but she describes it as red, that's a contradiction. But Testimony 3 is about seeing something red from under the cherry tree, which could be the stand. The corsage is magenta. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 4: \"someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand.\" The stand is on the right, according to the pamphlet. So if Kay was under the cherry tree (left), the other side of the stand would be the right side. But the stand is at the right-most edge. So the other side of the stand would be beyond the stand, which is the edge of the building. So someone coming from there would have to be approaching from the edge of the building, which is impossible unless they were coming from the air. That could be a contradiction. Because the stand is at the right-most edge, so there's no space beyond it. So if someone came from the other side of the stand, they would have to be coming from the edge of the building, which isn't possible. Therefore, Testimony 4 (someone coming from the other side of the stand) contradicts the layout described in Evidence 7 (the stand is at the right-most edge). Therefore, Testimony 4 is impossible because the stand is at the edge, so there's nothing beyond it. Hence, the testimony and evidence 7 contradict each other.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (someone coming from the other side of the stand) and Evidence 7 (the stand is on the right-most edge, so there's no \"other side\" beyond it). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 4. But according to the evidence list, Evidence 7 is the Bigg Building Pamphlet. So the testimony 4 (index 4) would be the one that contradicts.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be {\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 4}."

Let our members discuss this matter with a clear conscience of the Goddess of Law! Today's deliberation shall be about... Miles Edgeworth's aptitude and ability as a prosecutor! Kay: Wh-Who are you...? Why are you wearing that raincoat...? Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhh! April 5, 1:23 PMHigh Prosecutors' OfficesRoom 1202 Examine evidence Front side of Prosecutor's Badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back side of Prosecutor's Badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! Edgeworth: Calm down. You're getting dust everywhere. Gumshoe: I've already cleaned this room three times since this morning! Edgeworth: Well, now you'll need to do it a fourth time. Gumshoe: You're way too calm, sir! What if they actually take your badge!? Edgeworth: A decision has not yet been made. Gumshoe: But it looks like it's pretty much decided! Don't you remember what Judge Gravelle said!? Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth, the P.I.C. has you in its sights. They will receive a report on everything you did here today... ...and you will most likely be required to appear before them. Edgeworth: I have been ordered to attend the meeting. ...That's all. Gumshoe: I hate this, sir! I won't be able to work with you anymore! Edgeworth: As a detective, perhaps you should welcome this turn of events. You would no longer have to work with such a troublesome prosecutor as myself. Gumshoe: Wh-Why would you say something like that, sir...? The problem is with the P.I.C. and their false accusations... Mr. Edgeworth... Don't tell me... you actually want to become a defense attorney? Edgeworth: ...... Gumshoe: B-Because you can't do that! Being a prosecutor is exactly what makes you Prosecutor Edgeworth, sir! Edgeworth: (...A defense attorney, huh? I became a prosecutor because of the incident where I lost my father... However, the reason I became interested in the legal world... ...was because my father who passed away... had been a defense attorney.) Ray: To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on. Gumshoe: Are you listening, sir!? I don't like this one bit! Edgeworth: There is no need for you to be so pessimistic. Maybe my replacement will be more lenient during your salary assessments. Gumshoe: A-Ah, I see... That way, I can eat more than just instant noodles every day...! Wait, what am I saying!? That's not the point here! Edgeworth: (He was... actually imagining it.) Gumshoe: We're busy right now! Come back later, pal! ???: Paging Mr. Edgeworth. Is there a Mr. Miles Edgeworth here? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth is busy now! I'll listen to whatever you have to say later, pal! ???: Hrmm... This isn't good! Your face has become all red. Errrm... A red face, a red face... Gumshoe: Umm, like I said, we're kind of busy right now, so... ???: I've got it! You have a tummy ache, right!? This calls for an injection, stat! Please roll up your sleeves! Gumshoe: Aiiieeeee! Nonono, I'm perfectly healthy! Edgeworth: ...Who might you be? Karin: Aaaah, I'm so sorry! I forgot to introduce myself! My name is Karin Jenson. I am a registered nurse at the Dye-Young Hospital. Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but nobody here is sick. You must have the wrong room. Karin: Are you Mr. Miles Edgeworth? You have such great wrinkles between your brow... Could it be lupus? This calls for an injection... Edgeworth: I-It's not lupus! Just tell me what business you have with me! Karin: Ahh. Yes, yes. Actually, there's someone who would like to see you. Please wait a moment. I'll call them here right now! Edgeworth: Wait! Gumshoe: She left, sir. I wonder who she's going to bring. Hmm, if she's bringing someone from the hospital... Could it be a patient, sir? Maybe it's someone who was traumatized by your harsh words... Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Gumshoe: S-See? When you glare at me like that, it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack. You could send someone to the hospital with that... Edgeworth: (I-Is it really that bad...? I'm just being my normal self, though.) Karin: Sorry for the wait! Well, what do you think? ???: ........ Edgeworth: What do I think...? ???: Umm... Do you not recognize me? Edgeworth: (Now that she mentions it, I feel like I've met her before...) ???: Umm... this card... Your name was written on it... Do you know who I am? Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Maybe you really did send her to the hospital... Edgeworth: Of course not! Gumshoe: But this is your business card, sir. It clearly says... \"Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth\". Edgeworth: Umm. Th-That's true... ???: I-I am terribly sorry... I'm, umm, well... Karin: The truth is, this girl... suffers from memory loss. Gumshoe: M... Memory loooosss? ???: Yes... That seems to be the case. Karin: Ahh... Her parents should be worried sick right now... They probably haven't been able to sleep. I doubt they've gotten more than 8 hours... Edgeworth: (Isn't that plenty of sleep?) Gumshoe: I see. It sure sounds horrible... but it's alright now! Since she has that business card, she must be an acquaintance of Mr. Edgeworth's. Just leave her to us, pal! Right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed... We might be able to verify her identity, at least. ???: Would you... really do that for me? Edgeworth: First, I'd like you to tell us everything that you know. Gumshoe: That's our Mr. Edgeworth! You have nothing to worry about now, Miss! Edgeworth: (Good grief...) Mysterious girl Leads to: \"(But still, where to begin? What should I ask her first...?)\" Present Anything ???: ...I am terribly sorry. Even if you give me that, I still don't remember anything about you. Edgeworth: N-No... I wasn't planning on giving it to you... Edgeworth: (But still, where to begin? What should I ask her first...?) Gumshoe: Miss. Do you remember your name? ???: My name...... I am terribly sorry. Karin: She's been like this ever since yesterday, y'know? Edgeworth: ...Hmm. So you found her yesterday. Karin: Wooow! That's amazing! How'd you know!? Edgeworth: (Wh... What a tiresome woman...) Karin: I found her stumbling around late last night, so I took her in. I wanted to help her out, so I looked through her things. Edgeworth: So, that's how you found my business card. Did she have anything else with her? Karin: Nothing to reveal her name or address... Ah! But! She was wearing this when I found her. It's an unusual design, don't you think? Edgeworth: Wha... Th-This badge is... Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaat! Th-The Yatagarasu's...! That means... I-I-It couldn't be! Edgeworth: Are you Kay!? ???: Kay......? Yatagarasu's Badge data jotted down in my Organizer. Your name Edgeworth: You are... Kay, right? Kay: I am... Kay...... Gumshoe: Kay! Don't you remember me!? I mean, you'd always call me \"Gummy\", pal! Kay: G-Gummy... I would call one of my elders something so rude...? Aaah... I'm so sorry! What a horrible thing I did...! I feel like my heart is going to burst from guilt! Gumshoe: Just...... Just what happened to you, pal! You've become so sensitive! If you're this sensitive, and delicate, and frail... ...then you're not even Kay anymore! You're someone else, pal! Edgeworth: Watch your words, Detective. If you say that... ...it almost sounds like Kay isn't sensitive or delicate at all. (Though I can't deny there is some truth to what he says.) Kay: Umm... What sort of person was I... before I lost my memory? Gumshoe: Well, for starters, your name was Kay Faraday. A cheerful girl full of spirit and vigor, and a Great Thief. Kay: Great Thief...? Edgeworth: Yes. To put it frankly... ...a Great Thief steals valuables from people's drawers and safes... Kay: St........Steal!! I caused so much trouble for others? Ahh... I'm so sorry! I never imagined I would be a criminal...! Maybe losing my memory was retribution for my crimes... Edgeworth: No, you didn't actually... Gumshoe: Uuugghh... This is so messed up, sir... Karin: But it does sort of make sense, y'know. These gloves and stuff, they look just like what a thief might wear. Gumshoe: Ah! Those clothes! Karin: Yes. She was wearing them when I found her. I had her change her clothes, so I'm holding onto them for now... Edgeworth: Hmm...? Something appears to be stuck on her clothes. Perhaps it has something to do with Kay's memory loss? Gumshoe: I'll send it down to the lab later and have them check it out, sir! Edgeworth: Good. I will be counting on you, Detective Gumshoe. Karin: At any rate... these really look like a thief's clothes, don't they! Kay: I-I am... a criminal... Edgeworth: It's true you were a Great Thief, but never once did you commit a crime. That alone I can assure you. Kay: ...Is that... so...? Edgeworth: (It's probably better if I don't press this issue any further.) Memory loss Leads to: \"...I'm really sorry. For not remembering you.\" Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: Is that a badge... for protecting someone? Like a badge worn by a hero of justice... right? Edgeworth: No... This is called a Prosecutor's Badge. I think what you're referred to would be a defense attorney's badge, right? Kay: I wonder...? This badge... makes me feel really nostalgic. As if someone really dear to me showed it to me a lot... Edgeworth: (Kay's father was a prosecutor. Perhaps little bits of her childhood memories still remain.) Yatagarasu's Badge Kay: Do you like badges, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Hmm. Not particularly. Kay: But you are always carrying around badges. Edgeworth: It is just a part of my job. And this badge is also a piece of evidence... Kay: I see. So you carry around things that you don't like in order to train and strengthen your spirit! Edgeworth: ...That is just clearly wrong. Examine evidence Front side of Yatagarasu's Badge Edgeworth: This is the badge that Kay is always wearing. It's emblazoned with the mark of the Yatagarasu and it really stands out. I doubt there are any thieves who would actually wear it. Kay: ...I'm really sorry. For not remembering you. Umm... What kind of relationship did we have? Edgeworth: Hmm. Well, that's... (Rather difficult to explain.) Gumshoe: Kay, you were... Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! Kay: Oh my! So then, a prosecutor is the kingpin of a Great Thief? Gumshoe: Uh, no... That's not what I meant, pal... Edgeworth: (The last time I met \"Kay\" was the day before yesterday... Just what did she do from then up until now...?) Ms. Jenson, was the badge the only thing this girl had on her? Karin: She did have some other things, but I don't think they will be very helpful at all. Edgeworth: I don't mind. Please show them to me. Karin: Well then, I'll give them to you one by one, OK! Gumshoe: This is a Jammin' Ninja mask. Maybe she went to a superhero show or something? Edgeworth: Hmm. This seems to be a letter addressed to Kay. This is a ticket stub. And this is... Gumshoe: ...a flower made of cloth! Like the ones you usually see in restrooms, sir! Edgeworth: ...A corsage. It is used primarily as an accessory for women. Karin: Well, that's everything. Did you find anything out? Gumshoe: Umm, not really. They were just a bunch of random things. Edgeworth: (I'll have to look them over in more detail later.) Jammin' Ninja Mask data jotted down in my Organizer. Letter jotted down in my Organizer. Ticket Stub data jotted down in my Organizer. Purple Flower data jotted down in my Organizer. Gumshoe: Ooh.... This is horrible! Kay's lost her memory! How do we get her back to normal!? Edgeworth: Calm down, Detective. I have already thought of something. Gumshoe: Oh! As I would expect of Mr. Edgeworth! So, what did you find out, sir? Edgeworth: Look at this ticket stub. Karin: Oh, it's a ticket for the viewing platform of the Bigg Building! Gumshoe: Umm, Ms. Nurse? Do you know something about the Bigg Building? Karin: Of course I do! It's a super famous dating spot, after all! They say that if a couple holds hands up there, they will be together forever... Tee hee. Edgeworth: The time stamp on the ticket is from yesterday. Moreover, it is only valid on the day of issue. Gumshoe: Since she only has the stub... she must have used it, right? Edgeworth: It is very likely. ...Well then, let's go. Gumshoe: Ehh! Right now, sir? Edgeworth: The cause of Kay's memory loss is hidden in her actions. Gumshoe: B-But... What about the P.I.C.!? Edgeworth: It's still too early for me to be summoned there. Karin: Errrm... So, should I leave Kay with you, then? Edgeworth: That is what I would prefer. Kay, you're fine with that, right? Kay: Ah... Yes, please! Thank you very much! Karin: Well, I have to get back to work, so if anything happens, please contact the Dye-Young Hospital. If you guys need an injection, I'll be there anytime, please! Edgeworth: Yes. I understand. (I don't think I will call her for an injection, though.) Well then. Let's go, Detective. ...And you too, Kay. Gumshoe: Yessir! Kay: Thank you... for helping me. April 5, 2:07 PMOutside Bigg BuildingTower Plaza Gumshoe: Umm. According to the pamphlet... ...this building is 50 stories tall. It's mostly filled with offices though... Only the viewing platform is open to the public. Here you go, sir. I just got this at the reception desk. Edgeworth: Good. Thank you. Bigg Building Pamphlet data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Well then, let us head inside immediately... Eeeek! The Bigg Building... The Bigg Building is collapsing! Edgeworth: Hm! Gumshoe: Wh-What!? ???: No, you can't! Please stop! Please... I beg of you! Ugh, it's no good. Unless I drink fresh milk, my thoughts just won't reach...! Gumshoe: What's wrong, pal!? Did something happen at the Bigg Building!? Cuuuuuut! Cut, cut, cut, cuuuut! ???: E-Excuse me! We're sort of in the middle of shooting a movie, and umm... Edgeworth: (...Hmph. I suspected as much.) We are sorry for any trouble we've caused you. ...Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I-I'm so sorry, pal! I really thought the tower was gonna collapse or something... ???: Whatever... Hey, director! I'm taking a break. ???: I'm sorry... I'm really, really sorry! Kay: What a relief... It looks like the tower's collapse was prevented somehow. Edgeworth: (Explaining all this to Kay as she is now would take more time than it's worth...) Well then. We should get going. April 5, 2:18 PMBigg BuildingViewing Platform Gumshoe: Wow, what a view! I bet I can see my house from here! Kay: Eek...! Th-The wind... is really strong up here. Gumshoe: Everything should be fine as long as you stay close to me and Mr. Edgeworth, pal. If you start to blow away, one of us will be sure to catch you! Edgeworth: (It's not as if she's a kite!) Kay, do you recognize this place? Kay: ...I-I don't know. Was I... really here? Edgeworth: (Maybe if I get her to talk a bit, it will help jog her memory...) Kay. Just tell me whatever you remember. Anything will do. Kay: O-OK. But I don't know how much help I'll be... -- Memories of the Tower -- Kay: Did I... really come to a place like this? It's so high up, and the wind is so strong... It's frightening. ...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all... .....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible. Gumshoe: Hmm. Her memory isn't clearing up at all, huh? Kay: ...I'm so sorry. It's a bit pathetic, isn't it? You are both going out of your way for me, but I'm not helping at all. Edgeworth: You're doing just fine. You have memory loss, after all. Gumshoe: Alright, Mr. Edgeworth! Remember to go easy on her, sir. Normally, you have this really intense and kind of scary look on your face. Edgeworth: (...You're not helping, Detective.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This ticket stub proves that you were indeed here. Kay: But I really don't remember coming here at all. I don't think I would want to come to a place like this. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You used to love places like these, though. Kay: Was that... really me? We're so high up... Just looking down makes me dizzy. I think these kinds of places should be shut down. What if an elderly person or a small child were to fall off...! Edgeworth: The railing here is quite high. I think your worries are unfounded. Kay: ...Is that so...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you don't remember anything... In that case, is there anything that looks familiar? Kay: Looks familiar? Umm....... Ah! The cherry tree! Edgeworth: What about the cherry tree? Kay: I was standing under that cherry tree... That's right, I was taking shelter from the rain because it was raining then... And there... A red... I saw... something red... Edgeworth: (Hmm. She was under the cherry tree while it rained... And... from there she saw something red...) Kay: Umm, is something wrong...? Edgeworth: It's nothing. Could you add that last part to your story? Change this statement to: \"But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: A red... what exactly? Kay: A red... something or other. It was something red. That's... all I can remember about it. Edgeworth: (Speaking of things that are red here...) Could it be that stand over there? Kay: Stand... A red... stand... ...Ahh, that's right! I saw someone walking towards me from the other side of that stand. Edgeworth: And then what happened? Kay: And then... Umm... .....I'm sorry. Edgeworth: It's alright. Simply add everything you just said to your story. Change this statement to: \"Umm... That's right, someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By that stand, do you mean the stand directly behind you? Kay: Yes. From behind that red stand, someone came walking towards me... I saw it from under the cherry tree. Edgeworth: You've been saying that you saw \"someone\"... Does that mean you didn't see their face? Or was it a person you didn't know? Kay: .....I'm sorry. That much, I don't know. Edgeworth: (So \"someone\" came walking towards her from behind the red stand... ...and she saw that from beneath the cherry tree.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is there nothing else that comes to mind? It doesn't have to be related to the case. Kay: Even if it's not related.....? Umm... Well... Ah... I remember that the stand there was selling cotton candy. Edgeworth: ...If you're hungry, you should just say so. Gumshoe: I'll make sure to buy one for you later, pal! Kay: ...Thank you very much. I look forward to it. Edgeworth: (There's not much I can do unless I can draw out more information from her... For now, I'll press her for more details and see what I can find out.)-- Memories of the Tower -- Kay: Did I... really come to a place like this? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This ticket stub proves that you were indeed here. Kay: But I really don't remember coming here at all. I don't think I would want to come to a place like this.

Edgeworth: (So \"someone\" came walking towards her from behind the red stand... ...and she saw that from beneath the cherry tree.) Present Bigg Building Pamphlet Edgeworth: Leads to: \"So, you're saying that someone came from behind the stand...\" Kay: .....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is there nothing else that comes to mind? It doesn't have to be related to the case. Kay: Even if it's not related.....? Umm... Well... Ah... I remember that the stand there was selling cotton candy. Edgeworth: ...If you're hungry, you should just say so. Gumshoe: I'll make sure to buy one for you later, pal! Kay: ...Thank you very much. I look forward to it. Edgeworth: (There's not much I can do unless I can draw out more information from her... For now, I'll press her for more details and see what I can find out.) Edgeworth: So, you're saying that someone came from behind the stand... ...and walked directly towards you. Kay: Yes. Someone came right up to me. Edgeworth: Then that \"someone\" must have been a ghost. Kay: No, it was a person! I'm sure of it! Edgeworth: If this is where you were under the cherry tree, then someone behind the stand... ...wouldn't have any ground to stand on. They'd be floating in midair! No person should be able to stand there! Kay: Eeeeek! Kay: But... I... I'm not lying! Someone... red... Someone in red... was on the other side of the stand... They were walking towards me... Ahh... Getting closer and closer, and then... ...that person... that person... AAAAAAAAAHHHH! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong!? Calm down! It's alright! Me and Mr. Edgeworth are both here for you, pal! Kay: I-I... I was... pushed off. That person... in red... Yes, they were wearing a red raincoat... Edgeworth: (Someone in a red raincoat was walking in midair? And furthermore, they pushed her off this building? Nonsense. There is no way she could be alright after falling from a building this high!) Kay's memories jotted down in my Organizer. Officer: Attention, everyone! Please remain where you are! Gumshoe: What's wrong, pal? I'm a detective! Tell me what's going on! Officer: Sir! A body was just discovered in this building! Gumshoe: A-A body!? Edgeworth: Who is the victim!? Officer: We're currently investigating the details, but the victim is a woman! We have verified that her name is \"Kay\"! Edgeworth: What... Gumshoe: WHAAAAAAAAT!? To be continued. April 5, 2:36 PMBigg BuildingP.I.C. Meeting Room Edgeworth: (Th-This room is...!) Would this room happen to be... Officer: Yes, sir! It's the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee's meeting room! Gumshoe: Whaat! It's here!? Edgeworth: I had heard they recently moved out of the Prosecutor's Building. (But to think that they moved here of all places...) Bigg Building Pamphlet data updated in my Organizer. Karin: Mr. Edgeworth! Kay! What brings you here? How are you holding up? Edgeworth: We're in the middle of an investigation right now. Sorry, but who might this be? Karin: Ah! This is my Granny! Errm, let me just... \"Hi there sonny, the name's Bonnie Young. Who the heck are you?\" ...she says. Edgeworth: It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor. Ms. Jenson, isn't Young the name of... Karin: *ahem!* Granny is the director of the Dye-Young Hospital! Edgeworth: (This old lady... is the director?) Karin: \"Who're you callin' old!\" ...she says. Edgeworth: (...Sh-She can read my thoughts?) Gumshoe: Oh! So that Granny is pretty important, huh? Karin: Ah ha ha! I wouldn't go that far... I mean, yes, she is. Aah, these people are... the patient's guardians. Y'know, the one with amnesia... Edgeworth: (Hmm. It seems she is a bit of an introvert.) Karin: \"Hey sonny, want me to cure that bad case of the frownies for you?\" ...she says. Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: Ha ha ha! I'm afraid that's an incurable disease for Mr. Edgeworth, pal! Karin: Eh? Really, Granny? You want me to say that... \"I ain't got nothin' to say to you whippersnappers! You're free to do whatever you want. But you better not get in the way of my autopsy.\" Edgeworth: Please wait. We're... Karin: \"No means no!\" Gumshoe: Hey, you don't have the right to decide that, pal! Karin: S-Sorry! Granny is the coroner, you see. And she's in charge of this case, so... Ouch! So, I'm very sorry, but that's the way it is. Gumshoe: Whaddaya mean, \"that's the way it is,\" pal!? Karin: Well... Even if you ask me, I'm not the one who said it. Gumshoe: I kinda feel like..... I'm watching a comedy act, sir. Karin: Well, we need to get back to the autopsy, so please excuse us! And take care! Gumshoe: What was with her attitude!? Edgeworth: We received permission to investigate. There shouldn't be any problems. Gumshoe: That atittude of hers is a huge problem, sir! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth...? What do we do now? Edgeworth: We'll investigate the scene, of course. As a prosecutor, I cannot stand by and do nothing. Kay: ......... Edgeworth: Well then, let's begin. Kay: But, the policeman said the dead person is also named \"Kay\"... Then, I'm pretty sure I'm not the Kay that you know, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: We shall investigate that now. But... don't worry. There's no question that you are the Kay I know. Kay: .....OK! Edgeworth: (An amnesiac Kay, and a corpse Kay... Both are connected to the Bigg Building. I'm certain that this case will lead me to Kay's lost memories!) Begin Investigation Bigg BuildingP.I.C. Meeting Room Partner Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Notice anything? Gumshoe: For a homicide to occur out of the blue like that, it sure is surprising, sir! I may be a detective, but when things happen so suddenly, my mind goes completely blank! And that's why I haven't noticed anything at all, sir! Edgeworth: Hmm... It takes a certain kind of talent to be able to declare that so cheerfully. Gumshoe: O... Oh...! Are you saying I'm talented!? I-I'm honored, sir! Being praised by Mr. Edgeworth! Those kind words... I'll never forget this moment! Edgeworth: (...He looks so happy, I can't bring myself to tell him that it's all a misunderstanding!) Bigg Building Edgeworth: I never thought the P.I.C.'s meeting room would be right under the viewing platform. Gumshoe: It sure saved us the trouble of getting here! In fact, the P.I.C. is actually mentioned in this pamphlet, sir. It's in the Bigg Building's Little Gossip Column. ...I'll read it for you! \"The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee is located on the 50th floor of the Bigg Building! It's a place where Prosecutors turn into Ex-Prosecutors.\" Edgeworth: Hm...! Gumshoe: \"So come visit the 50th floor, and see the dejected looks on the Prosecutors' faces!\" Edgeworth: I-I am not making a dejected face! Gumshoe: Hey! I'm just reading what's in the pamphlet, sir! Kay Faraday Gumshoe: The living Kay we have here, and the dead \"Kay\" over there... Why do they have the same name? It can't just be a coincidence, sir! Edgeworth: Indeed. However, we won't be able to answer that question until we examine the body... Gumshoe: It's all because of that crabby coroner! Edgeworth: She is only doing her job. For now, all we can do is wait. Gumshoe: Umm... Th-Then right now, since we have some time... ...allow me to present one of my theories to you, sir! The answer is simple! With all the advancements in scientific technology... ...what if the two Kays are clones!? That's the only way any of this makes sense! Edgeworth: ............ Let's investigate the other parts of the room, until the autopsy is finished. Gumshoe: Aww, please don't ignore me like that, sir... Present Prosecutor's Badge Gumshoe: If you're not going to be a prosecutor anymore, then what am I supposed to do...? Edgeworth: Now isn't the time to be thinking of such things, Detective. Gumshoe: But! It's not fair that the P.I.C. keeps on hounding you like this, Mr. Edgeworth! You haven't even done anything wrong! If anything, you just... rub people the wrong way. Edgeworth: ...You should watch what you say as well, so you don't rub people the wrong way. Yatagarasu's Badge Gumshoe: It's Kay's treasure. She always wears it on her clothes. Edgeworth: Even after seeing her own badge, she still didn't remember anything... Gumshoe: It's just strange, seeing Kay acting so unlike herself. I'm not even sure how I should act towards her anymore. Edgeworth: You should just be yourself, Detective. For her sake. Gumshoe: ! You're right, sir! Alright! Well then, time to start making some careless mistakes! Edgeworth: (He's actually aware that he makes careless mistakes...!) Letter Gumshoe: A letter has a stamp... right? And stamps... go right into my collection. Edgeworth: I never pictured you as a stamp enthusiast, Detective. Gumshoe: Whenever I get a letter, I make sure to check the stamps very carefully. And, if I find one that doesn't have a postmark on it...! Edgeworth: ...Are you saying that you reuse old stamps? Gumshoe: O-Of course not, sir. I'm a law-abiding Detective, after all. Ha ha ha. Edgeworth: ...Something tells me that isn't completely true. Kay's Memories Gumshoe: I wonder where Kay lost her memories. *sigh*... Maybe one of the security guards found it, and it's sitting in the Lost & Found... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe... Are you joking around? Gumshoe: Not at all, sir! I just want to do something for Kay! Anything! Because... I just feel so bad for her. Edgeworth: If that's how you feel, then devote yourself completely to the investigation... ...because right now, that's the only thing we can do. Gumshoe: Yes... Yes, sir! Just tell me whatever you want me to do! Anything else Gumshoe: Ha ha ha! Mr. Edgeworth, you're such a joker! Even if you show that to me, I still have no idea what it is, sir! Edgeworth: (He proclaimed that quite proudly...) Bookshelf on left Gumshoe: These books all seem really think and heavy, sir... Edgeworth: The P.I.C. did just move in here. Moving all these books must have been a lot of work. Gumshoe: Moving heavy objects is my specialty, sir! If they had just called me, I would've helped! Edgeworth: Heh. Then perhaps I should ask the chairman if there's anything else left for you to move. Gumshoe: ...Whooooah! Th-That was just a joke, sir! If I had to carry something up 50 stories, I wouldn't be able to do any more work today! Edgeworth: (Of course, I was joking too... But were you really going to carry things up the stairs?) Half round table Edgeworth: It's half of a large round table with 11 chairs. It seems to be based off a certain legend. Gumshoe: I know that one, sir! It's the famous Knights of the Brown Table! Edgeworth: ...... Gumshoe: H-Huh!? Was I wrong? Knights of the Clown Table? Knights who say Ni!? Edgeworth: (He's getting colder... But I won't say anything.) Kay Faraday Kay: Yes? Can I help with something? Notice anything? Kay: Umm... This is an amazing room. There are large boxes filled with books, a stone sculpture, and sparkly windows. Edgeworth: Hmm... It seems you have also forgotten the names of objects. This might be helpful for recovering your memories. Just repeat after me. Bookcase. Kay: ...Broken safe. Edgeworth: Stained glass. Kay: ...Stolen goods. Edgeworth: Books on the law. Kay: ...Crooks on the lam. Edgeworth: Statue of the goddess. Kay: ...Snatched loot of the Great Thief. Edgeworth: (Are all her mistakes biased towards a certain way...?) Miles Edgeworth Edgeworth: Kay. Until just a few days ago, you were calling yourself my assistant. Looking at me, is there anything you remember? Kay: Things I remember, huh? Well, yes, just one thing... Mr. Edgeworth, on the viewing platform above us... Edgeworth: Oh? Kay: You pointed at me, and... Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: With a really scary face, you interrogated me! Edgeworth: (...That happened just a few minutes ago!) Gumshoe: Oh, poor Kay! The terror of Mr. Edgeworth badgering you for contradictions is your only memory... It must be scary, pal! Hopeless! The end of the world, pal! Edgeworth: (I should show this detective what true terror really is!) Detective Gumshoe Edgeworth: Kay. Before you lost your memories, you got along well with Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Does looking at me help you remember anything, pal? Kay: Do I remember anything? Ummm... Hmmmm...... Ah! I know! For a while now, Mr. Edgeworth has been getting on your case! Gumshoe: ...Th-That's not a memory. It's just a pleasant part of my daily life. Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (Oh? So Detective Gumshoe thinks it's pleasant... It seems I'll have to get on his case even more from now on!) Present Jammin' Ninja Mask, Letter, Ticket Stub, or Purple Flower Kay: I was carrying this, right? ...I don't remember anything about it though. Edgeworth: So you really don't remember? Not even a little bit? Kay: Well..... Ah! Maybe I just grabbed it without thinking, due to the shock of losing my memories! You know, like they say, \"grasping at straws.\" Edgeworth: ..... Kay: What's wrong? You have an awfully serious look on your face. Edgeworth: ...I won't tell you to be silent. But you should think before talking. Kay: I-I see... I will keep that in mind. Kay's Memories Kay: The person in the red raincoat really was there. Edgeworth: Are you sure that they were walking towards you from behind the stand? Kay: That's right... They walked straight up to me. There must be some evidence. Maybe that person... left footprints behind! Edgeworth: There is no ground behind the stand. No one could have walked there... Kay: Then, was that person... a ghost? Edgeworth: ...There are no such things as ghosts! Kay: O-Oh... Is this one of those so-called \"contradictions\"...? Bookshelves on middle Edgeworth: These bookshelves are very well organized. Looking at them feels good. Gumshoe: That's true! ...There's not even a speck of dust on them. But I'm also extremely dedicated to cleaning your office, sir! First I sweep, then I vacuum, next I wipe everything clean, twice, and then I was the... Edgeworth: (It'd be nice if you were this dedicated to your job...) Karin Jenson and Bonnie Young Karin: Um, I'm sorry. Right now Granny is in the middle of the autopsy, so... \"Are you sonnies tryin' to get in the way of my autopsy!?\" ...Is what she says. Could you please wait just a little bit longer? Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose we have no choice. We'll come back to investigate the body later. Lady Justice statue Edgeworth: This is... Lady Justice. Gumshoe: You sure do know a lot, sir. ...So, what kind of powers does she have? Edgeworth: She is a symbol of justice, not a superhero. (It's said the scales represent Justice; the sword, Power; and the blindfold, Equality.) Before examining bloodstain Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) After examining bloodstain Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Lady Justice statue Gumshoe: This is a really huge statue! Why's it in a place like this? Edgeworth: ...She is known as the Goddess of Justice. You might call it a statue for judging prosecutors. It seems this statue was also made by Pierre Hoquet. Gumshoe: Oh! You mean the victim of the IS-7 Incident, Isaac Dover!? Edgeworth: Setting aside his background and personality... he really was a brilliant sculptor. Gumshoe: Well, they do say that artists are either geniuses or weirdos. Edgeworth: (I suppose... Larry would fall into the latter category.) Bloodstain Edgeworth: A pool of blood lies at the feet of the goddess statue. Hmm. Judging from the pool of blood, it seems that this was where the victim was killed. Gumshoe: But, sir... the body is over there. Edgeworth: After murdering the victim, did the killer move the body...? Stand Edgeworth: If things had gone as planned, I would have been standing here right about now. Gumshoe: Yeah, sir... I'm glad that the P.I.C. meeting was delayed, but the cause of the delay was due to a murder... Edgeworth: (It's troubling to think that the P.I.C. meeting could condemn my career as a prosecutor. In any case, my top priority right now is to find the truth behind this case.) Officer Edgeworth: You there. Tell me the situation about the security of this room. Officer: Yes, sir! To enter this room, a special keycard is required! Edgeworth: I see. In other words, not just anyone can enter this room (Security - To enter the meeting room, a special keycard is needed.). So... the person who found the body was also...? Officer: Yes! It was a member of the P.I.C., who had come here for today's hearing. Edgeworth: (A member of the P.I.C... If not for this case, right now I would be...) Bookshelf on right Gumshoe: There's rows and rows of books. This solemn atmosphere's kinda scary, sir. Edgeworth: Scary? I would think that books foster a feeling of familiarity. Gumshoe: Actually, I once got in a lot of trouble for running through the library at full-speed, sir. But this isn't a library, so a light jog should be fine, right? Edgeworth: ...... (If I don't make sure to stop him, he might actually do it...) (Examining bloodstain and talking to the officer leads to:) ???: Excuse me. Karin: You are...? Oh, yes, what is it? \"That voice... It's Von Karma, right?\" Umm... Do you know her, Granny? ???: Good to see you again, Doctor. And you as well, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Wh... (What is she doing here!? Franziska von Karma... She is a prosecutor working with Interpol, and the daughter of Manfred von Karma. She should be jetting around the world right now...) Franziska: Wherever there is a case, I will follow. National borders mean nothing before me! Edgeworth: Your presence here must mean that this case has international significance... Franziska: You know well enough that I'm chasing a smuggling ring. I shall recover all the stolen goods and crush that organization! Edgeworth: Then... does that mean the smuggling ring is also involved in this particular case? Franziska: ...Any further information is confidential. I am not obligated to speak of it with you. Edgeworth: ...! (So, it won't be that easy...) Karin: Umm, Ms. Franziska... von Karma? Granny says... \"The autopsy is complete. You're free to do what you want.\" Edgeworth: In that case, we would like to investigate as well. Karin: \"I've heard rumors about you! No way am I letting you near the body! You're the prosecutor who's about to get the boot. You best run on home now, sonny!\" Er, umm, just so you know, I wasn't the one who said that, OK? Kay: P-Please, Granny. We need to investigate... No matter what. Karin: \"Hey, lassie! Who you callin' Granny!?\" Kay: Eeek...! I-I'm sorry! Edgeworth: (We're not getting anywhere... I guess I have no other choice.) Franziska, please allow us to aid you in your investigation. We must examine that body in order to find out what happened to Kay! Franziska: To Kay Faraday...? Gumshoe: I'm asking you too, sir! Kay's in really bad shape! Franziska: ......... I don't know what's going on... ...but fine, I'll grant you permission. Edgeworth: ...! You have my thanks. Franziska: Of course, I didn't say it would come without a price. You will explain everything to me later. Gumshoe: We really owe you one, sir! Franziska: I wasn't talking to you, Scruffy! Gumshoe: YEEEEOOWCH! Franziska: So that's how it is. If you would be so kind as to authorize them too, Doctor? Karin: \"I suppose it's fine if he's with a prosecutor from Interpol.\" ...Is what she says. And I fully agree with Granny. Franziska: By the Von Karma name, the entire world will be judged... That's just common knowledge. Edgeworth: (That's rather conceited for common knowledge...) Karin: \"Well, it's none of my beeswax anymore.\" ...Is what she says. Um, I hope you don't get in trouble for this. Franziska: You needn't worry. My reputation will not be shaken by something so petty. Edgeworth: (Unlike me, who is on the verge of losing his badge.) Begin Investigation Bigg BuildingP.I.C. Meeting Room Logic \"Security\" and \"Keycard\" Edgeworth: Perhaps the keycard the victim was holding is for this room. Gumshoe: I'll go find out, sir! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! From this room's security system... ...we were able to retrieve the data of the victim's card! Edgeworth: So that means, the victim was able to freely enter this room... Franziska: If the card actually belonged to the victim, of course. Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Keycard data jotted down in my Organizer. Partner Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Notice anything? Gumshoe: Prosecutor von Karma just got here, and she's already hit me with her whip. Even if I stand further back, she always seems to hit me before I can get out of the way. Edgeworth: No, it's worse than that. At times it feels like she'll even chase you down, if you manage to avoid her attacks. Gumshoe: Ah! Yeah... That feeling of despair, I know it all too well, sir! I won't lose to you in terms of how any times she's hit me with her whip, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (...That's not something to boast about.) Kay Faraday Gumshoe: Another Kay? I bet they look identical, sir! Like two peas in a pod. Edgeworth: They only share the same name. Please try not to jump the gun. Gumshoe: Jump the gun? ...Ahh! Is that like when you jump while you're holding a gun? The last time I did that, I accidentally discharged my gun and shot a hole in the ceiling! Edgeworth: That's not what it means at all! It means to not be so hasty. Gumshoe: Understood, sir! Well then, Mr. Edgeworth! We have permission to examine the body now, so let's see what secrets Kay's pea-in-a-pod holds! Edgeworth: (Someone's pod is missing a few peas...!) Please Detective... There's no need to jump the gun... The victim (after examining notebook) Gumshoe: The victim had Kay's notebook on her. Edgeworth: Yes. And because of that, she was mistakenly identified as \"Kay\". Gumshoe: They shouldn't have botched it up so badly! It's unforgivable! I'll arrest them all! Edgeworth: ...Before you arrest anyone for faulty logic, perhaps we should focus on finding the murderer? Gumshoe: Umm, yeah. I'll be helping with that too, sir! Edgeworth: (If botching things up were a crime, he'd be serving a life sentence...) ...In any case, there may still be something we have overlooked. Let's carefully examine the body one more time. Kay and the case (after examining notebook) Gumshoe: How do you think Kay ended up losing her memories? Edgeworth: Good question. Unfortunately, it will be difficult to answer at this point in time. However, the victim was in possession of the \"Promise Notebook\"... ...so it's possible that Kay is connected to this case in some form or other. Gumshoe: If her memory returned, there could be a huge breakthrough in the investigation! Edgeworth: (I don't imagine it will be quite that easy, though...) Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I've got a plan to get Kay's memory back! Edgeworth: I'd leave that kind of thinking to the hospital staff. Gumshoe: Please sir... Just hear me out! First, we need to get a really big hammer... Edgeworth: Forget it, Detective. Karin Jenson and Bonnie Young Karin: \"You sonnies want something?\" ...Is what she says. Dr. Young Edgeworth: Ms. Jenson. Could you tell me about your relationship with Dr. Young? Karin: Yes... Ever since I was little, I've always been together with Granny. Whenever I got lost, she would search for me until it got dark. And whenever I fell down, she would watch over me until I could get up on my own. Edgeworth: (What a charming story. She sounds like quite the grandmother's child.) Karin: And after I became a nurse, whenever I'm about to make a mistake with my injections... \"Not there, THERE!\" she'd say, as she'd grab the needle and... Ouch! Gumshoe: Ouch! Just hearing it hurts, pal! Please keep those stories to yourself! Karin: Anyways, as long as I have Granny by my side, there's no nursing I can't do. Edgeworth: I... I see. I fully understand. Thank you for your cooperation. (Regardless of her charming story, they do seem to share a very close-knit bond.) The autopsy Gumshoe: Dr. Young, you sure are a masterful coroner, pal! You work with such blinding speed and you make no wasted movements! Karin: \"Whaddaya sonnies know about autopsies!? You don't know the first thing about my work!\" Gumshoe: U-Ughhhhh... Edgeworth: Allow me to apologize for his rudeness. I'll be sure to reprimand him later. Karin: \"Hmph. Listen up, young'un. It is my duty to perform the autopsy quickly and accurately. That's why I have no patience with those who get in the way of my work.\" ...Is what she says. Are you satisfied? Edgeworth: Yes, very much so. We only wish to investigate. We have no desire to get in your way. (It looks like Dr. Young's stubbornness comes from her devotion to her work.) Dye-Young Hospital Karin: The Dye-Young Hospital is a splendid hospital, and Granny is in charge of it. Well? How about it? Would you like to be admitted and experience it for yourself? \"That's right. Right now, there's an opening in our hospital suite with the outdoor spa.\" Edgeworth: We are in good health. There is obviously no need for us to be hospitalized. Gumshoe: That's right! We're perfectly healthy, pal! That's our sole redeeming feature! Edgeworth: (Just what does he mean by that?) Karin: Well, you see, the Dye-Young Hospital also accepts healthy patients! We're currently in the middle of our \"Full of Life! Healthy Hospital Stays\" campaign. Those without injury or illness can stay at our hospital for half the price! Edgeworth: (Why would you need to stay at a hospital if you're healthy?) Karin: This is the chance of a lifetime, so what do you say? Hospital stay! Hospital say! Gumshoe: Hmm. You know, an outdoor spa at half-price does sound like a good deal... Edgeworth: (Don't fall for it!) Present Prosecutor's Badge Karin: A Prosecutor's Badge? I've seen lots of those... Ouch! \"A prosecutor who's about to get canned shouldn't be showing off his lingering attachments. If that badge means so much to you, maybe you should've lived a better life.\" Edgeworth: ...What is truly important to me is not the badge itself. Karin: Erm, I'm sure what my Granny meant to say was... There are times when you have to obey those above you... Or something like that. Edgeworth: ...Thanks for the advice. Yatagarasu's Badge or Kay's Memories Karin: I'm really glad we found Kay's father. Edgeworth: Um, I am an acquaintance of hers. ...I'm not her father! Karin: Whaaat!? Then, what about that business card? Edgeworth: ...I doubt there are many children who carry around their parents' business cards. Karin: But, I carry one around. Granny's, I mean. So, surely... Ouch! \"I don't give a hoot how you're related! You took her in, so you'd better take good care of her!\" Edgeworth: Of course, that was my intention. Kay is in good hands. Candelabra Karin: The victim was stabbed in the chest with that. See, there are three stab wounds in her chest, right? Edgeworth: Could you tell me the cause of the wound on her head? Karin: Sorry. We don't really know that. Although we are certain that it happened post-mortem. Edgeworth: (Which means it may have occurred when the culprit moved the body? It would be nice if some evidence were to turn up...) Anything else Karin: \"That's tied up pretty well, that frilly thing of yours...\" Edgeworth: I would like you to look at this piece of evidence, rather than my clothes. Karin: \"Not interested!\" ...she says. I can't say I'm very interested either. Edgeworth: (Hmm. Perhaps I should try presenting a different piece of evidence?) Body Gumshoe: This body...! It's not Kay, sir! It doesn't look like her at all! Edgeworth: (...Of course it isn't. Kay is alive, after all.) Her age is... I'd guess around 30. And she's wearing a pantsuit. Gumshoe: Maybe she worked in one of the offices in this building. Edgeworth: So, her identity is still unknown. The question now becomes: why did the police believe her name was \"Kay\"...? Before examining head, jacket, wounds, right hand, notebook, and candelabraand deducing purple flower Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) After examining head, jacket, wounds, right hand, notebook, and candelabraand deducing purple flower Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Head Edgeworth: There is some blood on her head. Gumshoe: Maybe she was hit with something. Edgeworth: We don't know that for sure. Our investigation will ultimately clear that up. Jacket Edgeworth: The left side of her white jacker has been stained a deep red. This jacket... The buttons are on the right side. Gumshoe: Isn't that normal, sir? All of my cloths have the buttons on the right side. Edgeworth: For women, it is normal to have them on the left side. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, you really do know everything. Edgeworth: That's just common knowledge. Hmm... There doesn't seem to be anything out of place... Hm? There's something white in her pocket... Gumshoe: They're gloves. Pure white ones. One for each hand, sir. Edgeworth: ...They don't seem to be dirty. Could they be the victim's? Purple flower Edgeworth: Something seems to be pinned to her pocket. ...Hm. It's made out of purple cloth. Gumshoe: It looks like it's been forcibly torn off, doesn't it? Stab wound Edgeworth: There doesn't seem to be... anything in this pocket. Gumshoe: This pocket has holes in it, sir! Edgeworth: Judging by how the cloth was pierced... ...she must have been stabbed by some sharp object. Gumshoe: All your coins would fall out of those holes, sir... Edgeworth: ...Detective. Haven't you ever heard of a wallet? Gumshoe: Of course I have, sir! I just use my pockets though. Most people do, right? Edgeworth: .....Never mind. Right hand Edgeworth: There is a burn mark on her hand... Gumshoe: Is it conntected to the cause of death? Edgeworth: No, it appears to be an old scar. She probably got it a long time ago. Hm. It seems there is something in her hand. Detective, could you open her hand for me? Gumshoe: Yessir! Understood! This is... Oh, I know! This must be a gift card from a department sto- ...Yeeaaargh! Franziska: It seems to be a keycard. Gumshoe: Uuugh... Wh-Why... Edgeworth: The question is, what was this keycard (Keycard - The victim was carrying a keycard. What could it have been used for?) for? Notebook Edgeworth: ! This notebook...! Gumshoe: Huh!? Isn't that Kay's Promise Notebook!? This is the notebook she wrote all her promises to her father in! It really takes me back, sir. Edgeworth: Yes... (When Kay was young, she and her father wrote the promises they made in this notebook...) However... Why is it in a place like this...? Gumshoe: Ah! Now that you mention it... I once heard something from Detective Badd a long time ago. It seems that before anyone had noticed, Kay's \"memento\" had gone missing! Edgeworth: What...!? So a piece of evidence that was in police custody went missing? Gumshoe: Detective Badd frantically searched all over for it, but it seems he never found it... Edgeworth: (What could this mean...? Why was the missing notebook found here?) You there, do you happen to know anything about this notebook? Officer: The victim was carrying this notebook when we found her. That was the only evidence we had to identify the body. Edgeworth: So that's why you called her \"Kay\"... Gumshoe: What a misleading victim, huh. Why did she have Kay's notebook...? Edgeworth: (I sure would like to have some information on the victim's identity, though...) Candelabra Gumshoe: ...Could this be the murder weapon, sir? Edgeworth: A three-pronged candelabra. It's consistent with the number of stab wounds. She was probably stabbed by the prongs of the candelabra. Gumshoe: .....A candy zebra? Edgeworth: ...I'm afraid it's not quite what you're imagining, Detective. A candelabra... is a candlestick holder with multiple arms. Gumshoe: Ahh, so it's a candle holder. You know, one time I forgot to pay my electric bill, and I had to get by only with candles. Edgeworth: Wh-What time period are you from...? Candelabra data jotted down in my Organizer. Deduce (after examining purple flower) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Deduce purple flower and present Purple Flower Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The purple flower Kay had with her...\" Otherwise Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Look at this piece of evidence. Gumshoe: Is there something wrong with that piece of evidence, sir? Edgeworth: Doesn't this piece of evidence have a connection with the situation of the crime scene? Gumshoe: I don't think it's connected at all, sir... Edgeworth: Argh! (So I was wrong...) Gumshoe: You should look at the evidence you have on hand again, sir! Edgeworth: Indeed. There might be something that is connected to the crime scene. Edgeworth: The purple flower Kay had with her... I wonder if that originally belonged to the victim. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it... The cloth does look the same as the one on the pin! Edgeworth: Yes. Let's compare them without delay. Gumshoe: It's a perfect match, sir! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! Purple Flower data updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: (The fact that this flower belongs to the victim means...) Franziska: That can only mean that Kay Faraday came in contact with the victim. And about that corsage, it looks like it was forcibly ripped off. There is a possibility that Kay Faraday is connected to this case. And depending on the situation... ...we may have to consider her as a suspect. Gumshoe: What did you saaaaaaaay!? There's no way she did it! It's unthinkable! Kay could never do that, sir! Edgeworth: (However, it's true we have no evidence to deny that claim.) Kay: ......... Franziska: It's nothing more than a possibility at the moment. Isn't that right, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Indeed. For better or for worse. Officer Edgeworth: Is the investigation going well? Officer: Sir! I am actually putting my job aside to do some brain training! By focusing on images instead of words, you can stimulate your right brain! Edgeworth: ...Please stop talking. Franziska von Karma Franziska: Yes, what is it? Notice anything? Franziska: A murder case at the P.I.C. meeting room... Since you asked to cooperate in the investigation, I do hope you will be able to produce results. Edgeworth: Naturally. Why do you think I am here? Franziska: Well... Now that you mention it... Why are you here, exactly? Edgeworth: (! ...That's right. She still doesn't know about my P.I.C. hearing today.) Gumshoe: The circumstances behind it are deeper than the sea, sir! Allow me to explain it on Mr. Edgeworth's behalf... YEOWCH! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! I do not care about your \"circumstances\". All that matters now is reaching the truth of this case. Am I wrong? Edgeworth: Indeed. There is some truth in what you say. Gumshoe: If you ask me, I don't think that is totally righ- YEOWCH! Franziska: I'll say this. ...Whipping someone is easier than being worried! Gumshoe: But being on the receiving end of the whip isn't easy at al- YEOWCH! Franziska von Karma Edgeworth: Franziska. Why are you here when you are supposed to be working with Interpol? Franziska: Curious, are you? But, it's confidential. I have no obligation to tell you. Edgeworth: (Hmm. Her response was as I expected.) Franziska: More importantly, shouldn't there be a prosecutor in charge of this murder case? I don't know who it is, but I was hoping it wouldn't be someone completely useless. They're not even here yet... They're late! Just what is that fool doing!? Gumshoe: YEAARGH! I have nothing to do with it, sir! Edgeworth: I wouldn't think it's very commendable to just whip people at random... Franziska: I swing, therefore I whip! That is my philosophy. I will whip anyone who slacks off in their work! Edgeworth: (To the yet unseen prosecutor in charge, I hereby offer you my sympathies in advance...) Relation to Dr. Young Edgeworth: Judging from your exchange just now, I take it you've met Dr. Young before? Franziska: How astute, Miles Edgeworth. That's right. She is an acquaintance of mine. Back then... it's a long story. Edgeworth: (It seems she doesn't intend to tell me any more. Shall I leave it at that, then?) Gumshoe: So, what happened back then!? Please tell me all about it, sir! YEOOOWW! Franziska: A foolish fool, shamelessly prying into other people's business. Watch what you say, Scruffy! Gumshoe: How cruel! Whipping me out of the blue! With great whip comes great responsibility, sir! Franziska: One good whip deserves another! The scruffy fool gets the whip! Try harder, worthless whipbait! Gumshoe: YEAAAAAARRGHH! Edgeworth: (...Hmm. It appears I was right to leave it at that.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Edgeworth: Franziska, I would like you to take a look at this. Franziska: ...I'll ask, just in case. What is that? Edgeworth: It's my Prosecutor's Badge. Franziska: ...And? Edgeworth: Hmph. That is all. Nnghoooh! Franziska: You should be relieved. You felt pain, right? Edgeworth: Hm...? What do you mean by that? Franziska: Fools can't catch colds. So, I thought they wouldn't be able to feel pain either. Kay's Memories Franziska: Kay Faraday lost her memories? How dare you let that happen to her on your watch!? Edgeworth: ...Hrm. (I have no defense...) Kay: E-Erm...! It's not Mr. Edgeworth's fault...! Franziska: ! You, are you alright? Being bandaged up like that...! Kay: Ah... Yes. Thank you for worrying about me. Franziska: ......H-Her behavior is certainly strange. It's unusual to hear her give thanks like that. Miles Edgeworth! Hurry up and get her memories back! Edgeworth: (Why don't you just admit that you're worried about her?) Candelabra Franziska: There's no doubt, this candelabra was the murder weapon. ...It pains me to see a woman end up like this! Edgeworth: Let us find the true culprit, so that she may rest in peace. Franziska: The true culprit... I hope the truth doesn't turn out to be a cruel one. Anything else Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! Unlike you, I am actually busy. I don't have the time to look at something like that. Why don't you just look at that evidence again by yourself? Edgeworth: (She is certainly... as harsh as ever.) Examine evidence Prongs on Candelabra Edgeworth: The prongs of the candelabra are covered in blood. And the shape even matches up with the victim's wounds... Is this the murder weapon of this case? Bottom side of Candelabra Edgeworth: This is a rare shape for a pedestal. If the spot where it was put on still has this mark... ...then it will become apparent whether or not it had been placed there. (Connecting all possible Logic, examining head, jacket, wounds, notebook, and candelabra, and deducing purple flower leads to:) Investigation Complete Edgeworth: So, the victim's identity remains unknown... Kay: Umm... Should you really still be calling \"Kay\"? Gumshoe: Of course! What are you saying, pal!? Kay: Th-Thank you. But then, what about that woman...? Franziska: She is someone who you may have killed. That's all we know. Gumshoe: There's no way that's true! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: I... also do not believe you killed her. Franziska: You are such a na\u00efve man, Miles Edgeworth. ???: \u266c Here I come to save the dayyy! Edgeworth: (Hmm, that voice...) Debeste: \u266c So don't be afraid anymooore! For The Best Prosecutor is here todayyy! \u266a Gravelle: Pardon the interruption. Debeste: Mr. Edgeworth! Get away from the victim! I have inherited her dying wish! No one asked for YOU! Edgeworth: Hmm. Did you know the victim? Gravelle: Just as I thought... The Goddess of Law will surely reveal the truth to us. So please, rest in peace. Debeste: That's right, Verity! Now that I'm here, everything will be A-OK. The culprit will rue the day he crossed paths with MYARGH! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! Who is this fool of a man!? Edgeworth: (Wh-Why is she glaring at me!?) Gravelle: You are Franziska von Karma, am I correct? I apologize for my late introduction. I am Verity Gravelle. And the deceased individual is... Debeste: ...Attorney Jill Crane, one of the members of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee! Edgeworth: (I see. So that's why she had the keycard...) I take it you're in charge of this case? Debeste: That's right! And with me in charge, this case is as good as solv- YEOOOWW! Franziska: That reminds me... I haven't caught your name yet. Debeste: If you just wanted to know my name, you didn't have to whi- YEAAAARGH! Franziska: Just state your name. I will not tolerate any unnecessary remarks. Debeste: Uuugh... Sebastian Debeste. Edgeworth: (It seems the pecking order has been decided.) Karin: Mr. Sebastian Debeste? Here, this is from Granny. Debeste: This is... the autopsy report! Wah hah hah... It seems you've been bested, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (This wasn't a competition to begin with...) Karin: \"My job is done. May we meet again in front of another corpse.\" OK, let's go home quickly, and eat some noodles! I'll be leaving too! Take care everyone! Debeste: ...The victim's head wound was postmortem. Gravelle: Sebastian. Debeste: And the candelabra dealt the fatal blow. Estimated time of death is late last night... Wh-What is it, Verity? Gravelle: While I do appreciate your enthusiasm, perhaps you should give your tongue a rest. You might pull a muscle. Edgeworth: (That would be painful indeed...) Autopsy Report jotted down in my Organizer. Debeste: Anyways, it's quite clear now! Kay Faraday must be arrested! Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaat! What's the big idea, pal!? Gravelle: It's just as he says, Detective. The culprit is Ms. Kay Faraday. The young lady in bandages over there... Although she's not wearing her usual attire... Are you not Ms. Kay Faraday? Edgeworth: ..... And what would you do if she is Kay? If you're going to arrest her... ...then I will resist by any means necessary. ...That, I guarantee you. Gravelle: I am now convinced. The doubts surrounding your suitability as a prosecutor were indeed warranted. Kay: It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth. You can go. Don't worry about me... I'll be fine. Gumshoe: What are you saying, Kay!? You can't just go along with them, pal! Kay: But, I... I don't remember anything. What if I really did kill that woman and then forgot about it? If that's true... Gravelle: Acknowledgement is the Goddess' mercy. Atonement is her will. The Goddess of Law will surely praise you for your prudence! Edgeworth: Sebastian. And Judge Gravelle... If you believe she is the culprit, on what basis do you make your accusations? Unless I'm completely convinced by your explanation... I will not obey your orders! Debeste: Fine, have it your way! Now, sit tight and listen to the perfect reasoning of Debeste! -- Why We Suspect Kay? -- Debeste: I am the best in the world. No one else can do what I do. Yes! That's why I was the first to realize that Kay Faraday is the culprit! She broke into the meeting room in order to steal something. In other words, she's the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane! Gumshoe: His logic's as awful as ever, sir. Edgeworth: (Harsh words... coming from you, Detective.) I asked for some basis to your claims, yet your reasoning has told me absolutely nothing... Franziska: ...However, we have no evidence to prove she didn't do it either. Kay: ........ Gumshoe: Don't worry, Kay. I'm sure Mr. Edgeworth will pull off a miracle. Edgeworth: (Y-You think my deductions are some kind of miracle work...!?) Franziska: You'd better not disappoint me. Understand, Miles Edgeworth? Because if you do... this whip of mine won't stay silent. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Already... I've noticed two contradictions in your testimony. Debeste: My reasoning is flawless. It doesn't contain even a single contradiction. Edgeworth: Hm. The number of contradictions has just increased to three. Debeste: Oh, I get it! This is all a part of your plan to mislead me, isn't it? Well, too bad! Because \"The Best\" will not be lead astray! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you believe Kay is the culprit, then I would like to hear the basis for your reasoning. Debeste: Wah hah hah... Just sit back and be in awe of my brilliant deductions! Nothing escapes the watchful eye of \"The Best\"! Before I had even laid eyes on the crime scene... No, before I was even aware of this case... Yes! I knew that she was the culprit! YEEOOOOOWW! Franziska: ...Basis of your reasoning. Debeste: Yeeees, ma'am! E-Ermm, well... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: To steal something...? Steal what, exactly? Debeste: That's... Umm... Gravelle: What Kay Faraday tried to steal... was a file. Its contents, to be exact... An investigation report regarding Prosecutor Edgeworth. Franziska: Do you have any evidence to prove she needed something like that? Gravelle: Gravelle: I am not the one who needs to present evidence. Isn't that right, Prosecutor Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Um... Yes... I... suppose that may be true. Franziska: Wha...! Edgeworth: At any rate, Sebastian, please continue your reasoning. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you have any evidence to prove that no one else but Kay could have committed the crime? Debeste: Nope! Edgeworth: .....Sebastian. Let me tell you what would be the best thing for you to do. Look into any other possible suspects besides Kay. Right now. Posthaste. Debeste: \"The Best\" thing for me to do... Look into any other possible suspects...! Gravelle: Gravelle: According to the preliminary reports... there were no traces of anyone else besides her. Edgeworth: Even so, isn't it too premature to declare that she is the culprit? Gravelle: Declaring that she isn't so early into the investigation is a little premature as well, is it not? Edgeworth: (...! If only I had evidence that could prove Kay's innocence...!) Edgeworth: Good grief... There is a limit to how much you can falsely accuse someone. Kay: It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth... You don't have to... Edgeworth: Fear not, Kay. The truth will be revealted soon enough. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: (Kay couldn't have murdered Ms. Crane... If I can just prove that, she will be cleared of suspicion.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Dick Gumshoe\nDescription: Homicide detective from the local precinct who's always first on the scene at any murder investigation.\nCharacter 1\nName: Florence Niedler\nDescription: A nurse who works at Hertz Hospital.

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a lot of information from a game transcript, along with characters, evidence, and testimonies. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Specifically, the testimonies are from Debeste, accusing Kay of breaking into the meeting room to steal something, thereby being the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane.\n\nLooking at the evidence list, the Keycard (Evidence 10) is mentioned as being found in the victim's hand. The Keycard Record (Evidence 12) would show who used their keycard to enter the Committee chamber. If the victim had the keycard, then she could have entered the room herself, which contradicts Debeste's claim that Kay was the only one who could have broken in. However, the user might point to the Keycard as the evidence here.\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says Kay is the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane because she broke in. But if the victim had the keycard (Evidence 10), then she had access, implying others with keycards could enter, making Kay not the only possible culprit. So Evidence 10 (Keycard) contradicts Testimony 3 because the victim's possession of the keycard means others (like the victim herself) could have entered, so Kay isn't the only one who could have done it. Alternatively, the Keycard Record (12) might show that others entered, but in the given evidence list, Evidence 10 is the keycard found on the victim. The testimony claims Kay broke in, but if the victim had the keycard, maybe she was the one who let someone in, or the killer used her keycard. Either way, the existence of the keycard in the victim's hand suggests that access wasn't restricted to Kay, contradicting Debeste's assertion that Kay was the only one who could have entered."

Let our members discuss this matter with a clear conscience of the Goddess of Law! Today's deliberation shall be about... Miles Edgeworth's aptitude and ability as a prosecutor! Kay: Wh-Who are you...? Why are you wearing that raincoat...? Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhh! April 5, 1:23 PMHigh Prosecutors' OfficesRoom 1202 Examine evidence Front side of Prosecutor's Badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back side of Prosecutor's Badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! Edgeworth: Calm down. You're getting dust everywhere. Gumshoe: I've already cleaned this room three times since this morning! Edgeworth: Well, now you'll need to do it a fourth time. Gumshoe: You're way too calm, sir! What if they actually take your badge!? Edgeworth: A decision has not yet been made. Gumshoe: But it looks like it's pretty much decided! Don't you remember what Judge Gravelle said!? Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth, the P.I.C. has you in its sights. They will receive a report on everything you did here today... ...and you will most likely be required to appear before them. Edgeworth: I have been ordered to attend the meeting. ...That's all. Gumshoe: I hate this, sir! I won't be able to work with you anymore! Edgeworth: As a detective, perhaps you should welcome this turn of events. You would no longer have to work with such a troublesome prosecutor as myself. Gumshoe: Wh-Why would you say something like that, sir...? The problem is with the P.I.C. and their false accusations... Mr. Edgeworth... Don't tell me... you actually want to become a defense attorney? Edgeworth: ...... Gumshoe: B-Because you can't do that! Being a prosecutor is exactly what makes you Prosecutor Edgeworth, sir! Edgeworth: (...A defense attorney, huh? I became a prosecutor because of the incident where I lost my father... However, the reason I became interested in the legal world... ...was because my father who passed away... had been a defense attorney.) Ray: To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on. Gumshoe: Are you listening, sir!? I don't like this one bit! Edgeworth: There is no need for you to be so pessimistic. Maybe my replacement will be more lenient during your salary assessments. Gumshoe: A-Ah, I see... That way, I can eat more than just instant noodles every day...! Wait, what am I saying!? That's not the point here! Edgeworth: (He was... actually imagining it.) Gumshoe: We're busy right now! Come back later, pal! ???: Paging Mr. Edgeworth. Is there a Mr. Miles Edgeworth here? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth is busy now! I'll listen to whatever you have to say later, pal! ???: Hrmm... This isn't good! Your face has become all red. Errrm... A red face, a red face... Gumshoe: Umm, like I said, we're kind of busy right now, so... ???: I've got it! You have a tummy ache, right!? This calls for an injection, stat! Please roll up your sleeves! Gumshoe: Aiiieeeee! Nonono, I'm perfectly healthy! Edgeworth: ...Who might you be? Karin: Aaaah, I'm so sorry! I forgot to introduce myself! My name is Karin Jenson. I am a registered nurse at the Dye-Young Hospital. Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but nobody here is sick. You must have the wrong room. Karin: Are you Mr. Miles Edgeworth? You have such great wrinkles between your brow... Could it be lupus? This calls for an injection... Edgeworth: I-It's not lupus! Just tell me what business you have with me! Karin: Ahh. Yes, yes. Actually, there's someone who would like to see you. Please wait a moment. I'll call them here right now! Edgeworth: Wait! Gumshoe: She left, sir. I wonder who she's going to bring. Hmm, if she's bringing someone from the hospital... Could it be a patient, sir? Maybe it's someone who was traumatized by your harsh words... Edgeworth: What is that supposed to mean? Gumshoe: S-See? When you glare at me like that, it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack. You could send someone to the hospital with that... Edgeworth: (I-Is it really that bad...? I'm just being my normal self, though.) Karin: Sorry for the wait! Well, what do you think? ???: ........ Edgeworth: What do I think...? ???: Umm... Do you not recognize me? Edgeworth: (Now that she mentions it, I feel like I've met her before...) ???: Umm... this card... Your name was written on it... Do you know who I am? Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Maybe you really did send her to the hospital... Edgeworth: Of course not! Gumshoe: But this is your business card, sir. It clearly says... \"Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth\". Edgeworth: Umm. Th-That's true... ???: I-I am terribly sorry... I'm, umm, well... Karin: The truth is, this girl... suffers from memory loss. Gumshoe: M... Memory loooosss? ???: Yes... That seems to be the case. Karin: Ahh... Her parents should be worried sick right now... They probably haven't been able to sleep. I doubt they've gotten more than 8 hours... Edgeworth: (Isn't that plenty of sleep?) Gumshoe: I see. It sure sounds horrible... but it's alright now! Since she has that business card, she must be an acquaintance of Mr. Edgeworth's. Just leave her to us, pal! Right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed... We might be able to verify her identity, at least. ???: Would you... really do that for me? Edgeworth: First, I'd like you to tell us everything that you know. Gumshoe: That's our Mr. Edgeworth! You have nothing to worry about now, Miss! Edgeworth: (Good grief...) Mysterious girl Leads to: \"(But still, where to begin? What should I ask her first...?)\" Present Anything ???: ...I am terribly sorry. Even if you give me that, I still don't remember anything about you. Edgeworth: N-No... I wasn't planning on giving it to you... Edgeworth: (But still, where to begin? What should I ask her first...?) Gumshoe: Miss. Do you remember your name? ???: My name...... I am terribly sorry. Karin: She's been like this ever since yesterday, y'know? Edgeworth: ...Hmm. So you found her yesterday. Karin: Wooow! That's amazing! How'd you know!? Edgeworth: (Wh... What a tiresome woman...) Karin: I found her stumbling around late last night, so I took her in. I wanted to help her out, so I looked through her things. Edgeworth: So, that's how you found my business card. Did she have anything else with her? Karin: Nothing to reveal her name or address... Ah! But! She was wearing this when I found her. It's an unusual design, don't you think? Edgeworth: Wha... Th-This badge is... Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaat! Th-The Yatagarasu's...! That means... I-I-It couldn't be! Edgeworth: Are you Kay!? ???: Kay......? Yatagarasu's Badge data jotted down in my Organizer. Your name Edgeworth: You are... Kay, right? Kay: I am... Kay...... Gumshoe: Kay! Don't you remember me!? I mean, you'd always call me \"Gummy\", pal! Kay: G-Gummy... I would call one of my elders something so rude...? Aaah... I'm so sorry! What a horrible thing I did...! I feel like my heart is going to burst from guilt! Gumshoe: Just...... Just what happened to you, pal! You've become so sensitive! If you're this sensitive, and delicate, and frail... ...then you're not even Kay anymore! You're someone else, pal! Edgeworth: Watch your words, Detective. If you say that... ...it almost sounds like Kay isn't sensitive or delicate at all. (Though I can't deny there is some truth to what he says.) Kay: Umm... What sort of person was I... before I lost my memory? Gumshoe: Well, for starters, your name was Kay Faraday. A cheerful girl full of spirit and vigor, and a Great Thief. Kay: Great Thief...? Edgeworth: Yes. To put it frankly... ...a Great Thief steals valuables from people's drawers and safes... Kay: St........Steal!! I caused so much trouble for others? Ahh... I'm so sorry! I never imagined I would be a criminal...! Maybe losing my memory was retribution for my crimes... Edgeworth: No, you didn't actually... Gumshoe: Uuugghh... This is so messed up, sir... Karin: But it does sort of make sense, y'know. These gloves and stuff, they look just like what a thief might wear. Gumshoe: Ah! Those clothes! Karin: Yes. She was wearing them when I found her. I had her change her clothes, so I'm holding onto them for now... Edgeworth: Hmm...? Something appears to be stuck on her clothes. Perhaps it has something to do with Kay's memory loss? Gumshoe: I'll send it down to the lab later and have them check it out, sir! Edgeworth: Good. I will be counting on you, Detective Gumshoe. Karin: At any rate... these really look like a thief's clothes, don't they! Kay: I-I am... a criminal... Edgeworth: It's true you were a Great Thief, but never once did you commit a crime. That alone I can assure you. Kay: ...Is that... so...? Edgeworth: (It's probably better if I don't press this issue any further.) Memory loss Leads to: \"...I'm really sorry. For not remembering you.\" Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: Is that a badge... for protecting someone? Like a badge worn by a hero of justice... right? Edgeworth: No... This is called a Prosecutor's Badge. I think what you're referred to would be a defense attorney's badge, right? Kay: I wonder...? This badge... makes me feel really nostalgic. As if someone really dear to me showed it to me a lot... Edgeworth: (Kay's father was a prosecutor. Perhaps little bits of her childhood memories still remain.) Yatagarasu's Badge Kay: Do you like badges, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Hmm. Not particularly. Kay: But you are always carrying around badges. Edgeworth: It is just a part of my job. And this badge is also a piece of evidence... Kay: I see. So you carry around things that you don't like in order to train and strengthen your spirit! Edgeworth: ...That is just clearly wrong. Examine evidence Front side of Yatagarasu's Badge Edgeworth: This is the badge that Kay is always wearing. It's emblazoned with the mark of the Yatagarasu and it really stands out. I doubt there are any thieves who would actually wear it. Kay: ...I'm really sorry. For not remembering you. Umm... What kind of relationship did we have? Edgeworth: Hmm. Well, that's... (Rather difficult to explain.) Gumshoe: Kay, you were... Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! Kay: Oh my! So then, a prosecutor is the kingpin of a Great Thief? Gumshoe: Uh, no... That's not what I meant, pal... Edgeworth: (The last time I met \"Kay\" was the day before yesterday... Just what did she do from then up until now...?) Ms. Jenson, was the badge the only thing this girl had on her? Karin: She did have some other things, but I don't think they will be very helpful at all. Edgeworth: I don't mind. Please show them to me. Karin: Well then, I'll give them to you one by one, OK! Gumshoe: This is a Jammin' Ninja mask. Maybe she went to a superhero show or something? Edgeworth: Hmm. This seems to be a letter addressed to Kay. This is a ticket stub. And this is... Gumshoe: ...a flower made of cloth! Like the ones you usually see in restrooms, sir! Edgeworth: ...A corsage. It is used primarily as an accessory for women. Karin: Well, that's everything. Did you find anything out? Gumshoe: Umm, not really. They were just a bunch of random things. Edgeworth: (I'll have to look them over in more detail later.) Jammin' Ninja Mask data jotted down in my Organizer. Letter jotted down in my Organizer. Ticket Stub data jotted down in my Organizer. Purple Flower data jotted down in my Organizer. Gumshoe: Ooh.... This is horrible! Kay's lost her memory! How do we get her back to normal!? Edgeworth: Calm down, Detective. I have already thought of something. Gumshoe: Oh! As I would expect of Mr. Edgeworth! So, what did you find out, sir? Edgeworth: Look at this ticket stub. Karin: Oh, it's a ticket for the viewing platform of the Bigg Building! Gumshoe: Umm, Ms. Nurse? Do you know something about the Bigg Building? Karin: Of course I do! It's a super famous dating spot, after all! They say that if a couple holds hands up there, they will be together forever... Tee hee. Edgeworth: The time stamp on the ticket is from yesterday. Moreover, it is only valid on the day of issue. Gumshoe: Since she only has the stub... she must have used it, right? Edgeworth: It is very likely. ...Well then, let's go. Gumshoe: Ehh! Right now, sir? Edgeworth: The cause of Kay's memory loss is hidden in her actions. Gumshoe: B-But... What about the P.I.C.!? Edgeworth: It's still too early for me to be summoned there. Karin: Errrm... So, should I leave Kay with you, then? Edgeworth: That is what I would prefer. Kay, you're fine with that, right? Kay: Ah... Yes, please! Thank you very much! Karin: Well, I have to get back to work, so if anything happens, please contact the Dye-Young Hospital. If you guys need an injection, I'll be there anytime, please! Edgeworth: Yes. I understand. (I don't think I will call her for an injection, though.) Well then. Let's go, Detective. ...And you too, Kay. Gumshoe: Yessir! Kay: Thank you... for helping me. April 5, 2:07 PMOutside Bigg BuildingTower Plaza Gumshoe: Umm. According to the pamphlet... ...this building is 50 stories tall. It's mostly filled with offices though... Only the viewing platform is open to the public. Here you go, sir. I just got this at the reception desk. Edgeworth: Good. Thank you. Bigg Building Pamphlet data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Well then, let us head inside immediately... Eeeek! The Bigg Building... The Bigg Building is collapsing! Edgeworth: Hm! Gumshoe: Wh-What!? ???: No, you can't! Please stop! Please... I beg of you! Ugh, it's no good. Unless I drink fresh milk, my thoughts just won't reach...! Gumshoe: What's wrong, pal!? Did something happen at the Bigg Building!? Cuuuuuut! Cut, cut, cut, cuuuut! ???: E-Excuse me! We're sort of in the middle of shooting a movie, and umm... Edgeworth: (...Hmph. I suspected as much.) We are sorry for any trouble we've caused you. ...Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I-I'm so sorry, pal! I really thought the tower was gonna collapse or something... ???: Whatever... Hey, director! I'm taking a break. ???: I'm sorry... I'm really, really sorry! Kay: What a relief... It looks like the tower's collapse was prevented somehow. Edgeworth: (Explaining all this to Kay as she is now would take more time than it's worth...) Well then. We should get going. April 5, 2:18 PMBigg BuildingViewing Platform Gumshoe: Wow, what a view! I bet I can see my house from here! Kay: Eek...! Th-The wind... is really strong up here. Gumshoe: Everything should be fine as long as you stay close to me and Mr. Edgeworth, pal. If you start to blow away, one of us will be sure to catch you! Edgeworth: (It's not as if she's a kite!) Kay, do you recognize this place? Kay: ...I-I don't know. Was I... really here? Edgeworth: (Maybe if I get her to talk a bit, it will help jog her memory...) Kay. Just tell me whatever you remember. Anything will do. Kay: O-OK. But I don't know how much help I'll be... -- Memories of the Tower -- Kay: Did I... really come to a place like this? It's so high up, and the wind is so strong... It's frightening. ...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all... .....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible. Gumshoe: Hmm. Her memory isn't clearing up at all, huh? Kay: ...I'm so sorry. It's a bit pathetic, isn't it? You are both going out of your way for me, but I'm not helping at all. Edgeworth: You're doing just fine. You have memory loss, after all. Gumshoe: Alright, Mr. Edgeworth! Remember to go easy on her, sir. Normally, you have this really intense and kind of scary look on your face. Edgeworth: (...You're not helping, Detective.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This ticket stub proves that you were indeed here. Kay: But I really don't remember coming here at all. I don't think I would want to come to a place like this. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You used to love places like these, though. Kay: Was that... really me? We're so high up... Just looking down makes me dizzy. I think these kinds of places should be shut down. What if an elderly person or a small child were to fall off...! Edgeworth: The railing here is quite high. I think your worries are unfounded. Kay: ...Is that so...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You say you don't remember anything... In that case, is there anything that looks familiar? Kay: Looks familiar? Umm....... Ah! The cherry tree! Edgeworth: What about the cherry tree? Kay: I was standing under that cherry tree... That's right, I was taking shelter from the rain because it was raining then... And there... A red... I saw... something red... Edgeworth: (Hmm. She was under the cherry tree while it rained... And... from there she saw something red...) Kay: Umm, is something wrong...? Edgeworth: It's nothing. Could you add that last part to your story? Change this statement to: \"But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: A red... what exactly? Kay: A red... something or other. It was something red. That's... all I can remember about it. Edgeworth: (Speaking of things that are red here...) Could it be that stand over there? Kay: Stand... A red... stand... ...Ahh, that's right! I saw someone walking towards me from the other side of that stand. Edgeworth: And then what happened? Kay: And then... Umm... .....I'm sorry. Edgeworth: It's alright. Simply add everything you just said to your story. Change this statement to: \"Umm... That's right, someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: By that stand, do you mean the stand directly behind you? Kay: Yes. From behind that red stand, someone came walking towards me... I saw it from under the cherry tree. Edgeworth: You've been saying that you saw \"someone\"... Does that mean you didn't see their face? Or was it a person you didn't know? Kay: .....I'm sorry. That much, I don't know. Edgeworth: (So \"someone\" came walking towards her from behind the red stand... ...and she saw that from beneath the cherry tree.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is there nothing else that comes to mind? It doesn't have to be related to the case. Kay: Even if it's not related.....? Umm... Well... Ah... I remember that the stand there was selling cotton candy. Edgeworth: ...If you're hungry, you should just say so. Gumshoe: I'll make sure to buy one for you later, pal! Kay: ...Thank you very much. I look forward to it. Edgeworth: (There's not much I can do unless I can draw out more information from her... For now, I'll press her for more details and see what I can find out.)-- Memories of the Tower -- Kay: Did I... really come to a place like this?

Edgeworth: Then that \"someone\" must have been a ghost. Kay: No, it was a person! I'm sure of it! Edgeworth: If this is where you were under the cherry tree, then someone behind the stand... ...wouldn't have any ground to stand on. They'd be floating in midair! No person should be able to stand there! Kay: Eeeeek! Kay: But... I... I'm not lying! Someone... red... Someone in red... was on the other side of the stand... They were walking towards me... Ahh... Getting closer and closer, and then... ...that person... that person... AAAAAAAAAHHHH! Gumshoe: Wh-What's wrong!? Calm down! It's alright! Me and Mr. Edgeworth are both here for you, pal! Kay: I-I... I was... pushed off. That person... in red... Yes, they were wearing a red raincoat... Edgeworth: (Someone in a red raincoat was walking in midair? And furthermore, they pushed her off this building? Nonsense. There is no way she could be alright after falling from a building this high!) Kay's memories jotted down in my Organizer. Officer: Attention, everyone! Please remain where you are! Gumshoe: What's wrong, pal? I'm a detective! Tell me what's going on! Officer: Sir! A body was just discovered in this building! Gumshoe: A-A body!? Edgeworth: Who is the victim!? Officer: We're currently investigating the details, but the victim is a woman! We have verified that her name is \"Kay\"! Edgeworth: What... Gumshoe: WHAAAAAAAAT!? To be continued. April 5, 2:36 PMBigg BuildingP.I.C. Meeting Room Edgeworth: (Th-This room is...!) Would this room happen to be... Officer: Yes, sir! It's the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee's meeting room! Gumshoe: Whaat! It's here!? Edgeworth: I had heard they recently moved out of the Prosecutor's Building. (But to think that they moved here of all places...) Bigg Building Pamphlet data updated in my Organizer. Karin: Mr. Edgeworth! Kay! What brings you here? How are you holding up? Edgeworth: We're in the middle of an investigation right now. Sorry, but who might this be? Karin: Ah! This is my Granny! Errm, let me just... \"Hi there sonny, the name's Bonnie Young. Who the heck are you?\" ...she says. Edgeworth: It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor. Ms. Jenson, isn't Young the name of... Karin: *ahem!* Granny is the director of the Dye-Young Hospital! Edgeworth: (This old lady... is the director?) Karin: \"Who're you callin' old!\" ...she says. Edgeworth: (...Sh-She can read my thoughts?) Gumshoe: Oh! So that Granny is pretty important, huh? Karin: Ah ha ha! I wouldn't go that far... I mean, yes, she is. Aah, these people are... the patient's guardians. Y'know, the one with amnesia... Edgeworth: (Hmm. It seems she is a bit of an introvert.) Karin: \"Hey sonny, want me to cure that bad case of the frownies for you?\" ...she says. Edgeworth: ...! Gumshoe: Ha ha ha! I'm afraid that's an incurable disease for Mr. Edgeworth, pal! Karin: Eh? Really, Granny? You want me to say that... \"I ain't got nothin' to say to you whippersnappers! You're free to do whatever you want. But you better not get in the way of my autopsy.\" Edgeworth: Please wait. We're... Karin: \"No means no!\" Gumshoe: Hey, you don't have the right to decide that, pal! Karin: S-Sorry! Granny is the coroner, you see. And she's in charge of this case, so... Ouch! So, I'm very sorry, but that's the way it is. Gumshoe: Whaddaya mean, \"that's the way it is,\" pal!? Karin: Well... Even if you ask me, I'm not the one who said it. Gumshoe: I kinda feel like..... I'm watching a comedy act, sir. Karin: Well, we need to get back to the autopsy, so please excuse us! And take care! Gumshoe: What was with her attitude!? Edgeworth: We received permission to investigate. There shouldn't be any problems. Gumshoe: That atittude of hers is a huge problem, sir! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth...? What do we do now? Edgeworth: We'll investigate the scene, of course. As a prosecutor, I cannot stand by and do nothing. Kay: ......... Edgeworth: Well then, let's begin. Kay: But, the policeman said the dead person is also named \"Kay\"... Then, I'm pretty sure I'm not the Kay that you know, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: We shall investigate that now. But... don't worry. There's no question that you are the Kay I know. Kay: .....OK! Edgeworth: (An amnesiac Kay, and a corpse Kay... Both are connected to the Bigg Building. I'm certain that this case will lead me to Kay's lost memories!) Begin Investigation Bigg BuildingP.I.C. Meeting Room Partner Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Notice anything? Gumshoe: For a homicide to occur out of the blue like that, it sure is surprising, sir! I may be a detective, but when things happen so suddenly, my mind goes completely blank! And that's why I haven't noticed anything at all, sir! Edgeworth: Hmm... It takes a certain kind of talent to be able to declare that so cheerfully. Gumshoe: O... Oh...! Are you saying I'm talented!? I-I'm honored, sir! Being praised by Mr. Edgeworth! Those kind words... I'll never forget this moment! Edgeworth: (...He looks so happy, I can't bring myself to tell him that it's all a misunderstanding!) Bigg Building Edgeworth: I never thought the P.I.C.'s meeting room would be right under the viewing platform. Gumshoe: It sure saved us the trouble of getting here! In fact, the P.I.C. is actually mentioned in this pamphlet, sir. It's in the Bigg Building's Little Gossip Column. ...I'll read it for you! \"The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee is located on the 50th floor of the Bigg Building! It's a place where Prosecutors turn into Ex-Prosecutors.\" Edgeworth: Hm...! Gumshoe: \"So come visit the 50th floor, and see the dejected looks on the Prosecutors' faces!\" Edgeworth: I-I am not making a dejected face! Gumshoe: Hey! I'm just reading what's in the pamphlet, sir! Kay Faraday Gumshoe: The living Kay we have here, and the dead \"Kay\" over there... Why do they have the same name? It can't just be a coincidence, sir! Edgeworth: Indeed. However, we won't be able to answer that question until we examine the body... Gumshoe: It's all because of that crabby coroner! Edgeworth: She is only doing her job. For now, all we can do is wait. Gumshoe: Umm... Th-Then right now, since we have some time... ...allow me to present one of my theories to you, sir! The answer is simple! With all the advancements in scientific technology... ...what if the two Kays are clones!? That's the only way any of this makes sense! Edgeworth: ............ Let's investigate the other parts of the room, until the autopsy is finished. Gumshoe: Aww, please don't ignore me like that, sir... Present Prosecutor's Badge Gumshoe: If you're not going to be a prosecutor anymore, then what am I supposed to do...? Edgeworth: Now isn't the time to be thinking of such things, Detective. Gumshoe: But! It's not fair that the P.I.C. keeps on hounding you like this, Mr. Edgeworth! You haven't even done anything wrong! If anything, you just... rub people the wrong way. Edgeworth: ...You should watch what you say as well, so you don't rub people the wrong way. Yatagarasu's Badge Gumshoe: It's Kay's treasure. She always wears it on her clothes. Edgeworth: Even after seeing her own badge, she still didn't remember anything... Gumshoe: It's just strange, seeing Kay acting so unlike herself. I'm not even sure how I should act towards her anymore. Edgeworth: You should just be yourself, Detective. For her sake. Gumshoe: ! You're right, sir! Alright! Well then, time to start making some careless mistakes! Edgeworth: (He's actually aware that he makes careless mistakes...!) Letter Gumshoe: A letter has a stamp... right? And stamps... go right into my collection. Edgeworth: I never pictured you as a stamp enthusiast, Detective. Gumshoe: Whenever I get a letter, I make sure to check the stamps very carefully. And, if I find one that doesn't have a postmark on it...! Edgeworth: ...Are you saying that you reuse old stamps? Gumshoe: O-Of course not, sir. I'm a law-abiding Detective, after all. Ha ha ha. Edgeworth: ...Something tells me that isn't completely true. Kay's Memories Gumshoe: I wonder where Kay lost her memories. *sigh*... Maybe one of the security guards found it, and it's sitting in the Lost & Found... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe... Are you joking around? Gumshoe: Not at all, sir! I just want to do something for Kay! Anything! Because... I just feel so bad for her. Edgeworth: If that's how you feel, then devote yourself completely to the investigation... ...because right now, that's the only thing we can do. Gumshoe: Yes... Yes, sir! Just tell me whatever you want me to do! Anything else Gumshoe: Ha ha ha! Mr. Edgeworth, you're such a joker! Even if you show that to me, I still have no idea what it is, sir! Edgeworth: (He proclaimed that quite proudly...) Bookshelf on left Gumshoe: These books all seem really think and heavy, sir... Edgeworth: The P.I.C. did just move in here. Moving all these books must have been a lot of work. Gumshoe: Moving heavy objects is my specialty, sir! If they had just called me, I would've helped! Edgeworth: Heh. Then perhaps I should ask the chairman if there's anything else left for you to move. Gumshoe: ...Whooooah! Th-That was just a joke, sir! If I had to carry something up 50 stories, I wouldn't be able to do any more work today! Edgeworth: (Of course, I was joking too... But were you really going to carry things up the stairs?) Half round table Edgeworth: It's half of a large round table with 11 chairs. It seems to be based off a certain legend. Gumshoe: I know that one, sir! It's the famous Knights of the Brown Table! Edgeworth: ...... Gumshoe: H-Huh!? Was I wrong? Knights of the Clown Table? Knights who say Ni!? Edgeworth: (He's getting colder... But I won't say anything.) Kay Faraday Kay: Yes? Can I help with something? Notice anything? Kay: Umm... This is an amazing room. There are large boxes filled with books, a stone sculpture, and sparkly windows. Edgeworth: Hmm... It seems you have also forgotten the names of objects. This might be helpful for recovering your memories. Just repeat after me. Bookcase. Kay: ...Broken safe. Edgeworth: Stained glass. Kay: ...Stolen goods. Edgeworth: Books on the law. Kay: ...Crooks on the lam. Edgeworth: Statue of the goddess. Kay: ...Snatched loot of the Great Thief. Edgeworth: (Are all her mistakes biased towards a certain way...?) Miles Edgeworth Edgeworth: Kay. Until just a few days ago, you were calling yourself my assistant. Looking at me, is there anything you remember? Kay: Things I remember, huh? Well, yes, just one thing... Mr. Edgeworth, on the viewing platform above us... Edgeworth: Oh? Kay: You pointed at me, and... Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: With a really scary face, you interrogated me! Edgeworth: (...That happened just a few minutes ago!) Gumshoe: Oh, poor Kay! The terror of Mr. Edgeworth badgering you for contradictions is your only memory... It must be scary, pal! Hopeless! The end of the world, pal! Edgeworth: (I should show this detective what true terror really is!) Detective Gumshoe Edgeworth: Kay. Before you lost your memories, you got along well with Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Does looking at me help you remember anything, pal? Kay: Do I remember anything? Ummm... Hmmmm...... Ah! I know! For a while now, Mr. Edgeworth has been getting on your case! Gumshoe: ...Th-That's not a memory. It's just a pleasant part of my daily life. Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (Oh? So Detective Gumshoe thinks it's pleasant... It seems I'll have to get on his case even more from now on!) Present Jammin' Ninja Mask, Letter, Ticket Stub, or Purple Flower Kay: I was carrying this, right? ...I don't remember anything about it though. Edgeworth: So you really don't remember? Not even a little bit? Kay: Well..... Ah! Maybe I just grabbed it without thinking, due to the shock of losing my memories! You know, like they say, \"grasping at straws.\" Edgeworth: ..... Kay: What's wrong? You have an awfully serious look on your face. Edgeworth: ...I won't tell you to be silent. But you should think before talking. Kay: I-I see... I will keep that in mind. Kay's Memories Kay: The person in the red raincoat really was there. Edgeworth: Are you sure that they were walking towards you from behind the stand? Kay: That's right... They walked straight up to me. There must be some evidence. Maybe that person... left footprints behind! Edgeworth: There is no ground behind the stand. No one could have walked there... Kay: Then, was that person... a ghost? Edgeworth: ...There are no such things as ghosts! Kay: O-Oh... Is this one of those so-called \"contradictions\"...? Bookshelves on middle Edgeworth: These bookshelves are very well organized. Looking at them feels good. Gumshoe: That's true! ...There's not even a speck of dust on them. But I'm also extremely dedicated to cleaning your office, sir! First I sweep, then I vacuum, next I wipe everything clean, twice, and then I was the... Edgeworth: (It'd be nice if you were this dedicated to your job...) Karin Jenson and Bonnie Young Karin: Um, I'm sorry. Right now Granny is in the middle of the autopsy, so... \"Are you sonnies tryin' to get in the way of my autopsy!?\" ...Is what she says. Could you please wait just a little bit longer? Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose we have no choice. We'll come back to investigate the body later. Lady Justice statue Edgeworth: This is... Lady Justice. Gumshoe: You sure do know a lot, sir. ...So, what kind of powers does she have? Edgeworth: She is a symbol of justice, not a superhero. (It's said the scales represent Justice; the sword, Power; and the blindfold, Equality.) Before examining bloodstain Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) After examining bloodstain Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Lady Justice statue Gumshoe: This is a really huge statue! Why's it in a place like this? Edgeworth: ...She is known as the Goddess of Justice. You might call it a statue for judging prosecutors. It seems this statue was also made by Pierre Hoquet. Gumshoe: Oh! You mean the victim of the IS-7 Incident, Isaac Dover!? Edgeworth: Setting aside his background and personality... he really was a brilliant sculptor. Gumshoe: Well, they do say that artists are either geniuses or weirdos. Edgeworth: (I suppose... Larry would fall into the latter category.) Bloodstain Edgeworth: A pool of blood lies at the feet of the goddess statue. Hmm. Judging from the pool of blood, it seems that this was where the victim was killed. Gumshoe: But, sir... the body is over there. Edgeworth: After murdering the victim, did the killer move the body...? Stand Edgeworth: If things had gone as planned, I would have been standing here right about now. Gumshoe: Yeah, sir... I'm glad that the P.I.C. meeting was delayed, but the cause of the delay was due to a murder... Edgeworth: (It's troubling to think that the P.I.C. meeting could condemn my career as a prosecutor. In any case, my top priority right now is to find the truth behind this case.) Officer Edgeworth: You there. Tell me the situation about the security of this room. Officer: Yes, sir! To enter this room, a special keycard is required! Edgeworth: I see. In other words, not just anyone can enter this room (Security - To enter the meeting room, a special keycard is needed.). So... the person who found the body was also...? Officer: Yes! It was a member of the P.I.C., who had come here for today's hearing. Edgeworth: (A member of the P.I.C... If not for this case, right now I would be...) Bookshelf on right Gumshoe: There's rows and rows of books. This solemn atmosphere's kinda scary, sir. Edgeworth: Scary? I would think that books foster a feeling of familiarity. Gumshoe: Actually, I once got in a lot of trouble for running through the library at full-speed, sir. But this isn't a library, so a light jog should be fine, right? Edgeworth: ...... (If I don't make sure to stop him, he might actually do it...) (Examining bloodstain and talking to the officer leads to:) ???: Excuse me. Karin: You are...? Oh, yes, what is it? \"That voice... It's Von Karma, right?\" Umm... Do you know her, Granny? ???: Good to see you again, Doctor. And you as well, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Wh... (What is she doing here!? Franziska von Karma... She is a prosecutor working with Interpol, and the daughter of Manfred von Karma. She should be jetting around the world right now...) Franziska: Wherever there is a case, I will follow. National borders mean nothing before me! Edgeworth: Your presence here must mean that this case has international significance... Franziska: You know well enough that I'm chasing a smuggling ring. I shall recover all the stolen goods and crush that organization! Edgeworth: Then... does that mean the smuggling ring is also involved in this particular case? Franziska: ...Any further information is confidential. I am not obligated to speak of it with you. Edgeworth: ...! (So, it won't be that easy...) Karin: Umm, Ms. Franziska... von Karma? Granny says... \"The autopsy is complete. You're free to do what you want.\" Edgeworth: In that case, we would like to investigate as well. Karin: \"I've heard rumors about you! No way am I letting you near the body! You're the prosecutor who's about to get the boot. You best run on home now, sonny!\" Er, umm, just so you know, I wasn't the one who said that, OK? Kay: P-Please, Granny. We need to investigate... No matter what. Karin: \"Hey, lassie! Who you callin' Granny!?\" Kay: Eeek...! I-I'm sorry! Edgeworth: (We're not getting anywhere... I guess I have no other choice.) Franziska, please allow us to aid you in your investigation. We must examine that body in order to find out what happened to Kay! Franziska: To Kay Faraday...? Gumshoe: I'm asking you too, sir! Kay's in really bad shape! Franziska: ......... I don't know what's going on... ...but fine, I'll grant you permission. Edgeworth: ...! You have my thanks. Franziska: Of course, I didn't say it would come without a price. You will explain everything to me later. Gumshoe: We really owe you one, sir! Franziska: I wasn't talking to you, Scruffy! Gumshoe: YEEEEOOWCH! Franziska: So that's how it is. If you would be so kind as to authorize them too, Doctor? Karin: \"I suppose it's fine if he's with a prosecutor from Interpol.\" ...Is what she says. And I fully agree with Granny. Franziska: By the Von Karma name, the entire world will be judged... That's just common knowledge. Edgeworth: (That's rather conceited for common knowledge...) Karin: \"Well, it's none of my beeswax anymore.\" ...Is what she says. Um, I hope you don't get in trouble for this. Franziska: You needn't worry. My reputation will not be shaken by something so petty. Edgeworth: (Unlike me, who is on the verge of losing his badge.) Begin Investigation Bigg BuildingP.I.C. Meeting Room Logic \"Security\" and \"Keycard\" Edgeworth: Perhaps the keycard the victim was holding is for this room. Gumshoe: I'll go find out, sir! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! From this room's security system... ...we were able to retrieve the data of the victim's card! Edgeworth: So that means, the victim was able to freely enter this room... Franziska: If the card actually belonged to the victim, of course. Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Keycard data jotted down in my Organizer. Partner Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Notice anything? Gumshoe: Prosecutor von Karma just got here, and she's already hit me with her whip. Even if I stand further back, she always seems to hit me before I can get out of the way. Edgeworth: No, it's worse than that. At times it feels like she'll even chase you down, if you manage to avoid her attacks. Gumshoe: Ah! Yeah... That feeling of despair, I know it all too well, sir! I won't lose to you in terms of how any times she's hit me with her whip, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (...That's not something to boast about.) Kay Faraday Gumshoe: Another Kay? I bet they look identical, sir! Like two peas in a pod. Edgeworth: They only share the same name. Please try not to jump the gun. Gumshoe: Jump the gun? ...Ahh! Is that like when you jump while you're holding a gun? The last time I did that, I accidentally discharged my gun and shot a hole in the ceiling! Edgeworth: That's not what it means at all! It means to not be so hasty. Gumshoe: Understood, sir! Well then, Mr. Edgeworth! We have permission to examine the body now, so let's see what secrets Kay's pea-in-a-pod holds! Edgeworth: (Someone's pod is missing a few peas...!) Please Detective... There's no need to jump the gun... The victim (after examining notebook) Gumshoe: The victim had Kay's notebook on her. Edgeworth: Yes. And because of that, she was mistakenly identified as \"Kay\". Gumshoe: They shouldn't have botched it up so badly! It's unforgivable! I'll arrest them all! Edgeworth: ...Before you arrest anyone for faulty logic, perhaps we should focus on finding the murderer? Gumshoe: Umm, yeah. I'll be helping with that too, sir! Edgeworth: (If botching things up were a crime, he'd be serving a life sentence...) ...In any case, there may still be something we have overlooked. Let's carefully examine the body one more time. Kay and the case (after examining notebook) Gumshoe: How do you think Kay ended up losing her memories? Edgeworth: Good question. Unfortunately, it will be difficult to answer at this point in time. However, the victim was in possession of the \"Promise Notebook\"... ...so it's possible that Kay is connected to this case in some form or other. Gumshoe: If her memory returned, there could be a huge breakthrough in the investigation! Edgeworth: (I don't imagine it will be quite that easy, though...) Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I've got a plan to get Kay's memory back! Edgeworth: I'd leave that kind of thinking to the hospital staff. Gumshoe: Please sir... Just hear me out! First, we need to get a really big hammer... Edgeworth: Forget it, Detective. Karin Jenson and Bonnie Young Karin: \"You sonnies want something?\" ...Is what she says. Dr. Young Edgeworth: Ms. Jenson. Could you tell me about your relationship with Dr. Young? Karin: Yes... Ever since I was little, I've always been together with Granny. Whenever I got lost, she would search for me until it got dark. And whenever I fell down, she would watch over me until I could get up on my own. Edgeworth: (What a charming story. She sounds like quite the grandmother's child.) Karin: And after I became a nurse, whenever I'm about to make a mistake with my injections... \"Not there, THERE!\" she'd say, as she'd grab the needle and... Ouch! Gumshoe: Ouch! Just hearing it hurts, pal! Please keep those stories to yourself! Karin: Anyways, as long as I have Granny by my side, there's no nursing I can't do. Edgeworth: I... I see. I fully understand. Thank you for your cooperation. (Regardless of her charming story, they do seem to share a very close-knit bond.) The autopsy Gumshoe: Dr. Young, you sure are a masterful coroner, pal! You work with such blinding speed and you make no wasted movements! Karin: \"Whaddaya sonnies know about autopsies!? You don't know the first thing about my work!\" Gumshoe: U-Ughhhhh... Edgeworth: Allow me to apologize for his rudeness. I'll be sure to reprimand him later. Karin: \"Hmph. Listen up, young'un. It is my duty to perform the autopsy quickly and accurately. That's why I have no patience with those who get in the way of my work.\" ...Is what she says. Are you satisfied? Edgeworth: Yes, very much so. We only wish to investigate. We have no desire to get in your way. (It looks like Dr. Young's stubbornness comes from her devotion to her work.) Dye-Young Hospital Karin: The Dye-Young Hospital is a splendid hospital, and Granny is in charge of it. Well? How about it? Would you like to be admitted and experience it for yourself? \"That's right. Right now, there's an opening in our hospital suite with the outdoor spa.\" Edgeworth: We are in good health. There is obviously no need for us to be hospitalized. Gumshoe: That's right! We're perfectly healthy, pal! That's our sole redeeming feature! Edgeworth: (Just what does he mean by that?) Karin: Well, you see, the Dye-Young Hospital also accepts healthy patients! We're currently in the middle of our \"Full of Life! Healthy Hospital Stays\" campaign. Those without injury or illness can stay at our hospital for half the price! Edgeworth: (Why would you need to stay at a hospital if you're healthy?) Karin: This is the chance of a lifetime, so what do you say? Hospital stay! Hospital say! Gumshoe: Hmm. You know, an outdoor spa at half-price does sound like a good deal... Edgeworth: (Don't fall for it!) Present Prosecutor's Badge Karin: A Prosecutor's Badge? I've seen lots of those... Ouch! \"A prosecutor who's about to get canned shouldn't be showing off his lingering attachments. If that badge means so much to you, maybe you should've lived a better life.\" Edgeworth: ...What is truly important to me is not the badge itself. Karin: Erm, I'm sure what my Granny meant to say was... There are times when you have to obey those above you... Or something like that. Edgeworth: ...Thanks for the advice. Yatagarasu's Badge or Kay's Memories Karin: I'm really glad we found Kay's father. Edgeworth: Um, I am an acquaintance of hers. ...I'm not her father! Karin: Whaaat!? Then, what about that business card? Edgeworth: ...I doubt there are many children who carry around their parents' business cards. Karin: But, I carry one around. Granny's, I mean. So, surely... Ouch! \"I don't give a hoot how you're related! You took her in, so you'd better take good care of her!\" Edgeworth: Of course, that was my intention. Kay is in good hands. Candelabra Karin: The victim was stabbed in the chest with that. See, there are three stab wounds in her chest, right? Edgeworth: Could you tell me the cause of the wound on her head? Karin: Sorry. We don't really know that. Although we are certain that it happened post-mortem. Edgeworth: (Which means it may have occurred when the culprit moved the body? It would be nice if some evidence were to turn up...) Anything else Karin: \"That's tied up pretty well, that frilly thing of yours...\" Edgeworth: I would like you to look at this piece of evidence, rather than my clothes. Karin: \"Not interested!\" ...she says. I can't say I'm very interested either. Edgeworth: (Hmm. Perhaps I should try presenting a different piece of evidence?) Body Gumshoe: This body...! It's not Kay, sir! It doesn't look like her at all! Edgeworth: (...Of course it isn't. Kay is alive, after all.) Her age is... I'd guess around 30. And she's wearing a pantsuit. Gumshoe: Maybe she worked in one of the offices in this building. Edgeworth: So, her identity is still unknown. The question now becomes: why did the police believe her name was \"Kay\"...? Before examining head, jacket, wounds, right hand, notebook, and candelabraand deducing purple flower Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) After examining head, jacket, wounds, right hand, notebook, and candelabraand deducing purple flower Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Head Edgeworth: There is some blood on her head. Gumshoe: Maybe she was hit with something. Edgeworth: We don't know that for sure. Our investigation will ultimately clear that up. Jacket Edgeworth: The left side of her white jacker has been stained a deep red. This jacket... The buttons are on the right side. Gumshoe: Isn't that normal, sir? All of my cloths have the buttons on the right side. Edgeworth: For women, it is normal to have them on the left side. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, you really do know everything. Edgeworth: That's just common knowledge. Hmm... There doesn't seem to be anything out of place... Hm? There's something white in her pocket... Gumshoe: They're gloves. Pure white ones. One for each hand, sir. Edgeworth: ...They don't seem to be dirty. Could they be the victim's? Purple flower Edgeworth: Something seems to be pinned to her pocket. ...Hm. It's made out of purple cloth. Gumshoe: It looks like it's been forcibly torn off, doesn't it? Stab wound Edgeworth: There doesn't seem to be... anything in this pocket. Gumshoe: This pocket has holes in it, sir! Edgeworth: Judging by how the cloth was pierced... ...she must have been stabbed by some sharp object. Gumshoe: All your coins would fall out of those holes, sir... Edgeworth: ...Detective. Haven't you ever heard of a wallet? Gumshoe: Of course I have, sir! I just use my pockets though. Most people do, right? Edgeworth: .....Never mind. Right hand Edgeworth: There is a burn mark on her hand... Gumshoe: Is it conntected to the cause of death? Edgeworth: No, it appears to be an old scar. She probably got it a long time ago. Hm. It seems there is something in her hand. Detective, could you open her hand for me? Gumshoe: Yessir! Understood! This is... Oh, I know! This must be a gift card from a department sto- ...Yeeaaargh! Franziska: It seems to be a keycard. Gumshoe: Uuugh... Wh-Why... Edgeworth: The question is, what was this keycard (Keycard - The victim was carrying a keycard. What could it have been used for?) for? Notebook Edgeworth: ! This notebook...! Gumshoe: Huh!? Isn't that Kay's Promise Notebook!? This is the notebook she wrote all her promises to her father in! It really takes me back, sir. Edgeworth: Yes... (When Kay was young, she and her father wrote the promises they made in this notebook...) However... Why is it in a place like this...? Gumshoe: Ah! Now that you mention it... I once heard something from Detective Badd a long time ago. It seems that before anyone had noticed, Kay's \"memento\" had gone missing! Edgeworth: What...!? So a piece of evidence that was in police custody went missing? Gumshoe: Detective Badd frantically searched all over for it, but it seems he never found it... Edgeworth: (What could this mean...? Why was the missing notebook found here?) You there, do you happen to know anything about this notebook? Officer: The victim was carrying this notebook when we found her. That was the only evidence we had to identify the body. Edgeworth: So that's why you called her \"Kay\"... Gumshoe: What a misleading victim, huh. Why did she have Kay's notebook...? Edgeworth: (I sure would like to have some information on the victim's identity, though...) Candelabra Gumshoe: ...Could this be the murder weapon, sir? Edgeworth: A three-pronged candelabra. It's consistent with the number of stab wounds. She was probably stabbed by the prongs of the candelabra. Gumshoe: .....A candy zebra? Edgeworth: ...I'm afraid it's not quite what you're imagining, Detective. A candelabra... is a candlestick holder with multiple arms. Gumshoe: Ahh, so it's a candle holder. You know, one time I forgot to pay my electric bill, and I had to get by only with candles. Edgeworth: Wh-What time period are you from...? Candelabra data jotted down in my Organizer. Deduce (after examining purple flower) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Deduce purple flower and present Purple Flower Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The purple flower Kay had with her...\" Otherwise Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Look at this piece of evidence. Gumshoe: Is there something wrong with that piece of evidence, sir? Edgeworth: Doesn't this piece of evidence have a connection with the situation of the crime scene? Gumshoe: I don't think it's connected at all, sir... Edgeworth: Argh! (So I was wrong...) Gumshoe: You should look at the evidence you have on hand again, sir! Edgeworth: Indeed. There might be something that is connected to the crime scene. Edgeworth: The purple flower Kay had with her... I wonder if that originally belonged to the victim. Gumshoe: Now that you mention it... The cloth does look the same as the one on the pin! Edgeworth: Yes. Let's compare them without delay. Gumshoe: It's a perfect match, sir! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! Purple Flower data updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: (The fact that this flower belongs to the victim means...) Franziska: That can only mean that Kay Faraday came in contact with the victim. And about that corsage, it looks like it was forcibly ripped off. There is a possibility that Kay Faraday is connected to this case. And depending on the situation... ...we may have to consider her as a suspect. Gumshoe: What did you saaaaaaaay!? There's no way she did it! It's unthinkable! Kay could never do that, sir! Edgeworth: (However, it's true we have no evidence to deny that claim.) Kay: ......... Franziska: It's nothing more than a possibility at the moment. Isn't that right, Miles Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ...Indeed. For better or for worse. Officer Edgeworth: Is the investigation going well? Officer: Sir! I am actually putting my job aside to do some brain training! By focusing on images instead of words, you can stimulate your right brain! Edgeworth: ...Please stop talking. Franziska von Karma Franziska: Yes, what is it? Notice anything? Franziska: A murder case at the P.I.C. meeting room... Since you asked to cooperate in the investigation, I do hope you will be able to produce results. Edgeworth: Naturally. Why do you think I am here? Franziska: Well... Now that you mention it... Why are you here, exactly? Edgeworth: (! ...That's right. She still doesn't know about my P.I.C. hearing today.) Gumshoe: The circumstances behind it are deeper than the sea, sir! Allow me to explain it on Mr. Edgeworth's behalf... YEOWCH! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! I do not care about your \"circumstances\". All that matters now is reaching the truth of this case. Am I wrong? Edgeworth: Indeed. There is some truth in what you say. Gumshoe: If you ask me, I don't think that is totally righ- YEOWCH! Franziska: I'll say this. ...Whipping someone is easier than being worried! Gumshoe: But being on the receiving end of the whip isn't easy at al- YEOWCH! Franziska von Karma Edgeworth: Franziska. Why are you here when you are supposed to be working with Interpol? Franziska: Curious, are you? But, it's confidential. I have no obligation to tell you. Edgeworth: (Hmm. Her response was as I expected.) Franziska: More importantly, shouldn't there be a prosecutor in charge of this murder case? I don't know who it is, but I was hoping it wouldn't be someone completely useless. They're not even here yet... They're late! Just what is that fool doing!? Gumshoe: YEAARGH! I have nothing to do with it, sir! Edgeworth: I wouldn't think it's very commendable to just whip people at random... Franziska: I swing, therefore I whip! That is my philosophy. I will whip anyone who slacks off in their work! Edgeworth: (To the yet unseen prosecutor in charge, I hereby offer you my sympathies in advance...) Relation to Dr. Young Edgeworth: Judging from your exchange just now, I take it you've met Dr. Young before? Franziska: How astute, Miles Edgeworth. That's right. She is an acquaintance of mine. Back then... it's a long story. Edgeworth: (It seems she doesn't intend to tell me any more. Shall I leave it at that, then?) Gumshoe: So, what happened back then!? Please tell me all about it, sir! YEOOOWW! Franziska: A foolish fool, shamelessly prying into other people's business. Watch what you say, Scruffy! Gumshoe: How cruel! Whipping me out of the blue! With great whip comes great responsibility, sir! Franziska: One good whip deserves another! The scruffy fool gets the whip! Try harder, worthless whipbait! Gumshoe: YEAAAAAARRGHH! Edgeworth: (...Hmm. It appears I was right to leave it at that.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Edgeworth: Franziska, I would like you to take a look at this. Franziska: ...I'll ask, just in case. What is that? Edgeworth: It's my Prosecutor's Badge. Franziska: ...And? Edgeworth: Hmph. That is all. Nnghoooh! Franziska: You should be relieved. You felt pain, right? Edgeworth: Hm...? What do you mean by that? Franziska: Fools can't catch colds. So, I thought they wouldn't be able to feel pain either. Kay's Memories Franziska: Kay Faraday lost her memories? How dare you let that happen to her on your watch!? Edgeworth: ...Hrm. (I have no defense...) Kay: E-Erm...! It's not Mr. Edgeworth's fault...! Franziska: ! You, are you alright? Being bandaged up like that...! Kay: Ah... Yes. Thank you for worrying about me. Franziska: ......H-Her behavior is certainly strange. It's unusual to hear her give thanks like that. Miles Edgeworth! Hurry up and get her memories back! Edgeworth: (Why don't you just admit that you're worried about her?) Candelabra Franziska: There's no doubt, this candelabra was the murder weapon. ...It pains me to see a woman end up like this! Edgeworth: Let us find the true culprit, so that she may rest in peace. Franziska: The true culprit... I hope the truth doesn't turn out to be a cruel one. Anything else Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! Unlike you, I am actually busy. I don't have the time to look at something like that. Why don't you just look at that evidence again by yourself? Edgeworth: (She is certainly... as harsh as ever.) Examine evidence Prongs on Candelabra Edgeworth: The prongs of the candelabra are covered in blood. And the shape even matches up with the victim's wounds... Is this the murder weapon of this case? Bottom side of Candelabra Edgeworth: This is a rare shape for a pedestal. If the spot where it was put on still has this mark... ...then it will become apparent whether or not it had been placed there. (Connecting all possible Logic, examining head, jacket, wounds, notebook, and candelabra, and deducing purple flower leads to:) Investigation Complete Edgeworth: So, the victim's identity remains unknown... Kay: Umm... Should you really still be calling \"Kay\"? Gumshoe: Of course! What are you saying, pal!? Kay: Th-Thank you. But then, what about that woman...? Franziska: She is someone who you may have killed. That's all we know. Gumshoe: There's no way that's true! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: I... also do not believe you killed her. Franziska: You are such a na\u00efve man, Miles Edgeworth. ???: \u266c Here I come to save the dayyy! Edgeworth: (Hmm, that voice...) Debeste: \u266c So don't be afraid anymooore! For The Best Prosecutor is here todayyy! \u266a Gravelle: Pardon the interruption. Debeste: Mr. Edgeworth! Get away from the victim! I have inherited her dying wish! No one asked for YOU! Edgeworth: Hmm. Did you know the victim? Gravelle: Just as I thought... The Goddess of Law will surely reveal the truth to us. So please, rest in peace. Debeste: That's right, Verity! Now that I'm here, everything will be A-OK. The culprit will rue the day he crossed paths with MYARGH! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! Who is this fool of a man!? Edgeworth: (Wh-Why is she glaring at me!?) Gravelle: You are Franziska von Karma, am I correct? I apologize for my late introduction. I am Verity Gravelle. And the deceased individual is... Debeste: ...Attorney Jill Crane, one of the members of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee! Edgeworth: (I see. So that's why she had the keycard...) I take it you're in charge of this case? Debeste: That's right! And with me in charge, this case is as good as solv- YEOOOWW! Franziska: That reminds me... I haven't caught your name yet. Debeste: If you just wanted to know my name, you didn't have to whi- YEAAAARGH! Franziska: Just state your name. I will not tolerate any unnecessary remarks. Debeste: Uuugh... Sebastian Debeste. Edgeworth: (It seems the pecking order has been decided.) Karin: Mr. Sebastian Debeste? Here, this is from Granny. Debeste: This is... the autopsy report! Wah hah hah... It seems you've been bested, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (This wasn't a competition to begin with...) Karin: \"My job is done. May we meet again in front of another corpse.\" OK, let's go home quickly, and eat some noodles! I'll be leaving too! Take care everyone! Debeste: ...The victim's head wound was postmortem. Gravelle: Sebastian. Debeste: And the candelabra dealt the fatal blow. Estimated time of death is late last night... Wh-What is it, Verity? Gravelle: While I do appreciate your enthusiasm, perhaps you should give your tongue a rest. You might pull a muscle. Edgeworth: (That would be painful indeed...) Autopsy Report jotted down in my Organizer. Debeste: Anyways, it's quite clear now! Kay Faraday must be arrested! Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaat! What's the big idea, pal!? Gravelle: It's just as he says, Detective. The culprit is Ms. Kay Faraday. The young lady in bandages over there... Although she's not wearing her usual attire... Are you not Ms. Kay Faraday? Edgeworth: ..... And what would you do if she is Kay? If you're going to arrest her... ...then I will resist by any means necessary. ...That, I guarantee you. Gravelle: I am now convinced. The doubts surrounding your suitability as a prosecutor were indeed warranted. Kay: It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth. You can go. Don't worry about me... I'll be fine. Gumshoe: What are you saying, Kay!? You can't just go along with them, pal! Kay: But, I... I don't remember anything. What if I really did kill that woman and then forgot about it? If that's true... Gravelle: Acknowledgement is the Goddess' mercy. Atonement is her will. The Goddess of Law will surely praise you for your prudence! Edgeworth: Sebastian. And Judge Gravelle... If you believe she is the culprit, on what basis do you make your accusations? Unless I'm completely convinced by your explanation... I will not obey your orders! Debeste: Fine, have it your way! Now, sit tight and listen to the perfect reasoning of Debeste! -- Why We Suspect Kay? -- Debeste: I am the best in the world. No one else can do what I do. Yes! That's why I was the first to realize that Kay Faraday is the culprit! She broke into the meeting room in order to steal something. In other words, she's the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane! Gumshoe: His logic's as awful as ever, sir. Edgeworth: (Harsh words... coming from you, Detective.) I asked for some basis to your claims, yet your reasoning has told me absolutely nothing... Franziska: ...However, we have no evidence to prove she didn't do it either. Kay: ........ Gumshoe: Don't worry, Kay. I'm sure Mr. Edgeworth will pull off a miracle. Edgeworth: (Y-You think my deductions are some kind of miracle work...!?) Franziska: You'd better not disappoint me. Understand, Miles Edgeworth? Because if you do... this whip of mine won't stay silent. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Already... I've noticed two contradictions in your testimony. Debeste: My reasoning is flawless. It doesn't contain even a single contradiction. Edgeworth: Hm. The number of contradictions has just increased to three. Debeste: Oh, I get it! This is all a part of your plan to mislead me, isn't it? Well, too bad! Because \"The Best\" will not be lead astray! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you believe Kay is the culprit, then I would like to hear the basis for your reasoning. Debeste: Wah hah hah... Just sit back and be in awe of my brilliant deductions! Nothing escapes the watchful eye of \"The Best\"! Before I had even laid eyes on the crime scene... No, before I was even aware of this case... Yes! I knew that she was the culprit! YEEOOOOOWW! Franziska: ...Basis of your reasoning. Debeste: Yeeees, ma'am! E-Ermm, well... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: To steal something...? Steal what, exactly? Debeste: That's... Umm... Gravelle: What Kay Faraday tried to steal... was a file. Its contents, to be exact... An investigation report regarding Prosecutor Edgeworth. Franziska: Do you have any evidence to prove she needed something like that? Gravelle: Gravelle: I am not the one who needs to present evidence. Isn't that right, Prosecutor Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Um... Yes... I... suppose that may be true. Franziska: Wha...! Edgeworth: At any rate, Sebastian, please continue your reasoning. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you have any evidence to prove that no one else but Kay could have committed the crime? Debeste: Nope! Edgeworth: .....Sebastian. Let me tell you what would be the best thing for you to do. Look into any other possible suspects besides Kay. Right now. Posthaste. Debeste: \"The Best\" thing for me to do... Look into any other possible suspects...! Gravelle: Gravelle: According to the preliminary reports... there were no traces of anyone else besides her. Edgeworth: Even so, isn't it too premature to declare that she is the culprit? Gravelle: Declaring that she isn't so early into the investigation is a little premature as well, is it not? Edgeworth: (...! If only I had evidence that could prove Kay's innocence...!) Edgeworth: Good grief... There is a limit to how much you can falsely accuse someone. Kay: It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth... You don't have to... Edgeworth: Fear not, Kay. The truth will be revealted soon enough. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: (Kay couldn't have murdered Ms. Crane... If I can just prove that, she will be cleared of suspicion.)-- Why We Suspect Kay? -- Debeste: I am the best in the world. No one else can do what I do. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Already... I've noticed two contradictions in your testimony. Debeste: My reasoning is flawless. It doesn't contain even a single contradiction. Edgeworth: Hm. The number of contradictions has just increased to three. Debeste: Oh, I get it! This is all a part of your plan to mislead me, isn't it? Well, too bad! Because \"The Best\" will not be lead astray! Debeste: Yes! That's why I was the first to realize that Kay Faraday is the culprit! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you believe Kay is the culprit, then I would like to hear the basis for your reasoning. Debeste: Wah hah hah... Just sit back and be in awe of my brilliant deductions! Nothing escapes the watchful eye of \"The Best\"! Before I had even laid eyes on the crime scene... No, before I was even aware of this case... Yes! I knew that she was the culprit! YEEOOOOOWW! Franziska: ...Basis of your reasoning. Debeste: Yeeees, ma'am! E-Ermm, well... Debeste: She broke into the meeting room in order to steal something. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: To steal something...? Steal what, exactly? Debeste: That's... Umm... Gravelle: What Kay Faraday tried to steal... was a file. Its contents, to be exact... An investigation report regarding Prosecutor Edgeworth. Franziska: Do you have any evidence to prove she needed something like that? Gravelle: Gravelle: I am not the one who needs to present evidence. Isn't that right, Prosecutor Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Um... Yes... I... suppose that may be true. Franziska: Wha...! Edgeworth: At any rate, Sebastian, please continue your reasoning. Present Keycard Edgeworth: Leads to: \"It certainly sounds like... you are quite familiar with this room.\" Debeste: In other words, she's the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you have any evidence to prove that no one else but Kay could have committed the crime? Debeste: Nope! Edgeworth: .....Sebastian. Let me tell you what would be the best thing for you to do. Look into any other possible suspects besides Kay. Right now. Posthaste. Debeste: \"The Best\" thing for me to do... Look into any other possible suspects...! Gravelle: Gravelle: According to the preliminary reports... there were no traces of anyone else besides her. Edgeworth: Even so, isn't it too premature to declare that she is the culprit? Gravelle: Declaring that she isn't so early into the investigation is a little premature as well, is it not? Edgeworth: (...! If only I had evidence that could prove Kay's innocence...!) Edgeworth: Good grief... There is a limit to how much you can falsely accuse someone. Kay: It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth... You don't have to... Edgeworth: Fear not, Kay. The truth will be revealted soon enough. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: (Kay couldn't have murdered Ms. Crane... If I can just prove that, she will be cleared of suspicion.) Edgeworth: It certainly sounds like... you are quite familiar with this room. Debeste: The Best man for the job should know all about The Best places. Edgeworth: Unfortunately, it seems that you are not The Best man for the job. Debeste: Are you mocking me!? Edgeworth: That's for you to decide. You didn't even know about this keycard, did you? Debeste: Of course I know about that! You need it to enter this room... ......... Huh? Was it really needed? Franziska: This foolish fool simply doesn't know when to give up! Debeste: YEEEOOOOOOWCH! Edgeworth: Sebastian, do you really suspect Kay? Debeste: Th-That's right! She's the only one who could have done it! Edgeworth: Well then, allow me to ask you... Since this room can only be entered by using a keycard... ...hoe did she enter the room without one!? Debeste: Gah...! W-Well, she probably used this and that, and... Nngh! Edgeworth: Oh? Did you pull a muscle? Allow me to explain then. The door could only be opened by members of the P.I.C. Which means... Gravelle: Yes. That's correct. Edgeworth: Hm? (She... conceded so easily...?) Gravelle: Take a look at this. It's a record of this room that I investigated just a while ago. At 12:52 AM, the door was opened using Ms. Crane's keycard. Keycard Record jotted down in my Organizer. Gravelle: It's probable... ...that the killer entered the room together with the victim, Ms. Crane. After entering, the situation must have sourced, leading to the murder. Edgeworth: Your logic holds... but it is still merely conjecture. And it would imply that the killer and the victim were acquainted. Gumshoe: No way, pal! Kay doesn't even know the victim! Gravelle: Gravelle: That is merely an assumption on your part... Unless you have any evidence to prove your claim? Evidence is everything, in court and at the crime scene. Without it, your argument is invalid. Franziska: In that case... I trust that you have evidence... ...to prove that Kay Faraday and the victim were connected. Gravelle: ...Of course. Edgeworth: Wh... What!? Gravelle: This letter... ...was discovered by Dr. Young in Ms. Crane's breast pocket. Edgeworth: (...The victim's belongings? Why did she withhold such vital evidence until now? Could it be... she was waiting for the perfect time to reveal it? Come to think of it...!) Debeste: And the candelabra dealt the fatal blow. Estimated time of death is late last night... Wh-What is it, Verity? Gravelle: While I do appreciate your enthusiasm, perhaps you should give your tongue a rest. You might pull a muscle. Gravelle: Hmhm... I'll read it for you. \"To Ms. Crane, Thank you so much for helping with my plan! I'm glad that we can help each other get what we want. It's like killing two birds with one stone! Please get revenge for 12 years ago!\" - Kay\" In other words, Kay Faraday and Ms. Crane were accomplices. They probably planned to steal something from this room. Edgeworth: P-Preposterous! Franziska: W-Wait! That means, the main culprit is... Gravelle: It's still Kay Faraday, of course. It just means her crimes have increased by yet one more. Victim's Letter jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: I'm... the main culprit...? Gumshoe: Don't believe her, Kay! It's all a bunch of nonsense! There's no way Kay would do something like that! Gravelle: Nonsense? Not at all. The evidence speaks for itself, wouldn't you agree? Edgeworth: Ngh...! (I knew that they wouldn't suspect Kay unless they had some sort of proof, but... ...to think they would actually have such decisive evidence!) Debeste: Nicely done, Verity! Gravelle: Thank you very much. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your explanation is still insufficient! I cannot accept such an argument! Gravelle: Sebastian. Would you please leave this to me? Debeste: Alright, make sure you shut Mr. Edgeworth up once and for all! Edgeworth: (I can't allow their allegations to gain any more momentum. I must turn it around here!) -- The Letter from Kay -- Gravelle: The relationship between Kay Faraday and Ms. Crane is as documented in the letter. She roped Ms. Crane into assisting her with her plan. However, for some reason, their partnership broke down. Ms. Crane was murdered... But with her dying breath, she managed to retaliate. Her parting gift is this letter, which she tucked safely away in her left breast pocket. Gumshoe: H-Her testimony's even better than ever. Maybe the most perfect it's ever been, sir...! Are you gonna be alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Um, yes... Of course. Franziska: How unsightly, Miles Edgeworth. Save your stoic act for some other time. Gumshoe: Ms. von Karma! Just whose side are you on!? Franziska: I'm on nobody's side, Scruffy. When searching for the truth, it's best not to take sides. Gumshoe: W-Watch what you say, Ms. von Karma, or else Mr. Debeste is gonna... Debeste: \"Best\" you say? Well, I can tell you that the side I'm on is always the BYAAARGH! Franziska: ...How irritating. Edgeworth: Well, I suppose that's one thing we can agree on. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And just what kind of relationship did Kay have with the victim? Gravelle: In the letter, she wrote, \"Thank you so much for helping with my plan!\" Their relationship should be quite obvious. That's right... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I would like to hear about Kay's alleged plan in more detail. Gravelle: Just as she wrote in the letter, she wanted to steal something. Debeste: What's more, the sender of the letter is Kay Faraday. So it's obvious who the main culprit is! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That letter could've easily been forged. It doesn't prove that she planned to steal anything. Gravelle: Gravelle: If memory serves me right... wasn't she a Great Thief? Edgeworth: Th-That's... She's... um, taking a break at the moment. Gravelle: I doubt there is any thief who would inform a prosecutor about their upcoming crimes. Perhaps she simply returned to her trade without you knowing? Edgeworth: (I suppose I have no means of denying that possibility...) Gravelle: Kay Faraday planned the theft and Ms. Crane got caught up in it. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"For some reason\" you say...? It seems your explanation isn't very clear. Gravelle: I'm sure the reason will become clear upon further investigation. But more importantly... ...there is no evidence to prove that Kay Faraday did not commit this crime. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: While there is some evidence to suggest that she committed a crime... ...none of it can truly be called decisive evidence! Gravelle: Gravelle: What about the letter that shows their complicity, and the scene of the crime... I think it's fair to say we cannot decisively rule out the possibility that she committed the crime. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you have any evidence to prove that Kay was the murderer? Debeste: Haven't you been listening! We've been saying that this letter is the evidence! Edgeworth: Oh? And where in the letter does it say that she planned to murder the victim? Debeste: ...Huh? E-Erm, well, that's... I've got it! It's a hidden message written in invisible ink that can only be read by heating it up! Gravelle: Sebastian. I wouldn't get your hopes up for something like that. There is, of course, evidence that points to her as the criminal. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We searched the victim's left breast pocket as well, but... Gravelle: You found nothing, I presume? Debeste: Naturally, the officer who found the letter immediately brought it to the Best man on the scene. Gravelle: The letter was safely tucked away in her left breast pocket, right above her heart... I believe this letter carries Ms. Crane's will for the criminal to be arrested. Edgeworth: I have no interest in your beliefs. What I'm interested in is the truth. You said that the letter was in the left breast pocket of the victim, correct? Gravelle: I swear by the Goddess of Law, there are no lies or mistakes in my statement. The letter was indeed discovered inside the victim's left breast pocket. Edgeworth: (The victim had been stabbed in the left chest area where the letter was hidden... This may very well be an important clue.) Edgeworth: (I don't think that Kay wrote the letter... ...but unless I can draw out more information here, that thought means nothing. I should start by pressing her for more details.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Dick Gumshoe\nDescription: Homicide detective from the local precinct who's always first on the scene at any murder investigation.\nCharacter 1\nName: Florence Niedler\nDescription: A nurse who works at Hertz Hospital.

      "evidence": 11,
      "testimony": 4
    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the given information. Let's start by reviewing the testimonies and the evidences.\n\nThe testimonies are all from Gravelle. The key points she makes are:\n\n1. The relationship between Kay and the victim (Ms. Crane) is as per the letter.\n2. Kay roped Ms. Crane into her plan.\n3. Their partnership broke down for some reason.\n4. Ms. Crane was murdered but managed to retaliate by leaving the letter in her left breast pocket.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence. Evidence 6 is the Magenta Flower, which is a corsage torn from the victim's clothes. The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the cause of death was stab wounds to the left chest, and the head injury was post-mortem. The victim's letter (Evidence 13) was found in the left breast pocket.\n\nWait, Gravelle's fourth testimony says the letter was in the left breast pocket. But if the victim was stabbed in the left chest (where the heart is), then the left breast pocket area would have been damaged. The letter was found there, but if the stab wounds were in that area, the letter might have been damaged or have blood on it. However, the key point here is the location of the letter and the stab wounds. \n\nLooking at the autopsy report (Evidence 11), the cause of death is stab wounds to the left chest, and the chest wounds were inflicted post-mortem. Wait, no\u2014wait the autopsy report says: \"Cause of death: Stab wounds to left chest. Head injury sustained post mortem. Death occurred as a result of a heavy blow to the head with a circular object. Chest wounds inflicted post-mortem.\" Wait, that's conflicting. Wait the autopsy report states that the chest wounds were inflicted post-mortem, and the actual cause of death was the head injury. So the victim was killed by a blow to the head, and then the chest was stabbed after death. \n\nBut Gravelle's testimony says that the letter was in the left breast pocket, which is where the post-mortem chest wounds were. If the stab wounds were post-mortem, then the letter could have been placed there after the stabbing. However, the letter was found in the left breast pocket, which was stabbed post-mortem. So if the letter was in that pocket, it would have been pierced by the stabbing. But the letter is intact. Therefore, the letter couldn't have been in the pocket when the stabbing occurred. Therefore, the testimony that the letter was safely tucked in the left breast pocket contradicts the evidence of the post-mortem chest wounds. Because if the chest was stabbed after death, and the letter was in the pocket, the letter would have been damaged by the stabs. But the letter is undamaged, so it must have been placed there after the stabbing. Thus, the victim couldn't have placed it there herself as a dying act. Therefore, the testimony that the victim \"tucked safely away in her left breast pocket\" (Testimony 4) contradicts the evidence that the chest wounds were inflicted post-mortem (Autopsy Report, Evidence 11). \n\nBut wait, the evidence in question here is Evidence 6, the Magenta Flower. Wait, the Magenta Flower is the corsage torn from the victim's clothes. How does that tie in? Let me check the evidence list again. Evidence 6: Magenta Flower, torn from the victim's clothes. The victim's clothes had a corsage, which was torn off. The victim's jacket (from the transcript) had buttons on the right side, which is unusual for women's clothing. The victim's jacket had the corsage (Magenta Flower) on it, which was torn off. \n\nWait, in the transcript, when examining the victim's jacket, Edgeworth notices the buttons are on the right, which is unusual for women's clothing. Then, in the pocket, there's a white corsage (purple flower in the original text, but in the evidence list, it's Magenta Flower). The corsage was torn off. \n\nSo the Magenta Flower (Evidence 6) was torn from the victim's clothes. If the victim was wearing it, and the corsage was torn, that might indicate a struggle. But how does this relate to Gravelle's testimony? \n\nWait, Gravelle's testimony 4 states that the victim tucked the letter into her left breast pocket. But if the victim's left breast pocket is where the post-mortem stab wounds were, then the letter would have been pierced. However, the autopsy report says the chest wounds were inflicted post-mortem. So the stabs happened after death. Therefore, if the letter was placed in the pocket before the stabs, the stabs would have damaged the letter. But the letter is intact. Therefore, the letter must have been placed in the pocket after the stabs. But the victim was already dead, so she couldn't have done that. Therefore, the letter was planted by the killer. This contradicts Gravelle's testimony that the victim placed it there. \n\nBut how does this tie into the evidence? The key evidence here would be the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) which states that the chest wounds were post-mortem. The testimony (Testimony 4) claims the victim placed the letter in her left breast pocket, but if the stabs to the chest were after death, then the letter couldn't have been there when the stabs happened. Therefore, the letter was placed after the stabs, meaning the victim couldn't have done it. Thus, the testimony that the victim placed the letter contradicts the evidence that the chest wounds were post-mortem. \n\nBut in the evidence list, the Magenta Flower (Evidence 6) is the corsage torn from the victim's clothes. The corsage was on the left side, perhaps. If the corsage was torn during the struggle, and the stabs to the chest (post-mortem) were through the same area, then the corsage's tear could be related. However, the key contradiction is between the testimony about the letter's placement and the autopsy report. \n\nWait, the user is asking for evidence and testimony. So the testimony is Testimony 4 (the letter was in the left breast pocket), and the evidence would be the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) which states that the chest wounds were post-mortem. However, in the provided list of evidences, the Autopsy Report is Evidence 11. But the user's options are to choose from the provided evidences. Let me check the list again.\n\nThe user provided Evidence 6: Magenta Flower (torn from victim's clothes). The corsage was on the victim's clothes, and in the transcript, when Edgeworth examines the jacket, he notices the corsage. The victim's jacket has the corsage (Magenta Flower) on her left side, perhaps. If the corsage was torn off, that could indicate a struggle. But how does this relate to the testimony?\n\nAlternatively, the Victim's Letter (Evidence 13) is the letter that Gravelle presents. The contradiction is that the letter was found in the left breast pocket, but the chest wounds (post-mortem) would have damaged the letter if it was there during the stabbing. Therefore, the letter couldn't have been placed by the victim. Therefore, the testimony that the victim placed it there contradicts the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11). But the user's task is to pick from the given evidences and testimonies.\n\nWait, the problem states that the answer must be in the format {\"evidence\": number, \"testimony\": number}, where the evidence is from the given list (0-24) and testimony (0-4).\n\nLooking at the given testimonies:\n\nTestimony 4: \"Her parting gift is this letter, which she tucked safely away in her left breast pocket.\"\n\nThe evidence that contradicts this is the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) which states that the chest wounds were inflicted post-mortem. Therefore, if the letter was in the left breast pocket when the chest was stabbed post-mortem, the letter would have been damaged. But the letter is intact, so it was placed after the stabs. Hence, the testimony that the victim put it there is false. Therefore, the evidence is the Autopsy Report (11) and testimony 4. But in the user's evidence list, Evidence 11 is the Autopsy Report. However, the user's options are to choose from the evidences provided. So, is there another evidence that directly shows this contradiction?\n\nAlternatively, the Magenta Flower (Evidence 6) is torn from the victim's clothes. If the victim's corsage was on the left side where the stabs occurred, the tear could indicate that the stabs happened after the corsage was there. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is between the letter's placement (Testimony 4) and the chest wounds being post-mortem (Autopsy Report, Evidence 11). Therefore, the evidence would be 11 (Autopsy Report) and testimony 4. But let me check the list again.\n\nYes, Evidence 11 is the Autopsy Report stating that the chest wounds were inflicted post-mortem, and the cause of death was a head injury. Therefore, the victim was killed by a blow to the head, then stabbed in the chest post-mortem. The letter was supposedly placed in the left breast pocket by the victim as a dying act, but since the stabs were after death, the letter would have been damaged unless placed after the stabs. Therefore, the testimony that the victim placed it there is contradicted by the evidence that the chest wounds were post-mortem.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair is Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4. However, in the user's list, the Autopsy Report is Evidence 11, and Testimony 4 is the one about the letter in the left breast pocket. So the JSON should be {\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 4}.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to pick one pair. Let me check if there's another possibility. Alternatively, the Magenta Flower (Evidence 6) is torn from the victim's clothes. If the victim was wearing the corsage on the left chest, and the stabs were there, the corsage would have been torn during the stabbing. But since the stabs were post-mortem, maybe the corsage was torn off earlier, indicating a struggle. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the key contradiction is the letter's placement and the post-mortem chest wounds. Therefore, the answer is Evidence 11 and Testimony 4."

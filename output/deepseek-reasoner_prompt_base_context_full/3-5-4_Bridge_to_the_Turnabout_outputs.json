But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one! Butz: I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na\u00efve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris! Iris: ... Phoenix: (Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?) To be continued. February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Edgeworth: Wright, is this what Godot was talking about? Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask\u2606DeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: \u266aNo motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!\u266a \u266a...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...\u266a Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! \u266aGood cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...\u266a Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting\u00a0??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down...

She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you. (I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant secret left to unlock... Pearls's Psyche-Lock...) [sic] Revenge (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...)

Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: I think it's time you told the truth about what you were doing on that night. Iris: ... Phoenix: You said you were in your room at Hazakura Temple the entire time. Do you still claim that to be the truth? Iris: Yes... That's where I was. Phoenix: Iris... I believe you're innocent. That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder! Present Bikini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Iris!? I trust you, so you need to trust me. Iris: But, Mr. Wright... I can't. Phoenix: Why not? Iris: I can't trust such random nonsense! It doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I screwed up there...) Leads back to: \"Iris... I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... But mistakes just don't suit you. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: I had hoped you would get at least this much correct. I hate seeing you mess up and getting all disappointed. Phoenix: (Nngh... I didn't know she could be so harsh...) Phoenix: Iris, what are you trying to hide...? Iris: ...! Phoenix: The more you lie about it, the more I know it's got to be something really important. Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with?

It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" There were two of you. Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

Phoenix: (I think I've pretty much got all the evidence I need. Now I just need to find out what Pearls is hiding.) Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: I... After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept!

I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure. I couldn't even grant my mother's final wish... Phoenix: Her \"final wish\"...? Pearl: Yes. This letter. \"This is my last wish,\" she said. \"So make sure you follow the instructions carefully.\" Phoenix: (Hmm... This letter... I definitely need to find out more about it.) Morgan's letter (appears after \"Lost powers\") Pearl: My mother has gone to a place called a \"penitentiary\". Phoenix: Yeah... I know, Pearls. Pearl: I visit her every month... And last month, she told me... Morgan: The time we've been waiting for has come, Pearl. There's something I need you to do for me. I hid a letter for you at our home before they brought me here. I want you to read it, and do exactly what it says. It's for the good of the Fey clan, my angel. You'll be doing a great thing. Now, listen carefully, and I'll tell you where the letter's hidden... Pearl: My mother is always nice to me... I love her very much! Butz: Yeah. Moms will do anything for their kids, right? Pearl: She said it was for the good of the Fey clan, so I knew I had to help her. I mean, Mystic Maya's part of the Fey clan, so it had to be good for her, too. That's right, isn't it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Usually, a picture is enough to channel someone's spirit, but this time... Butz: ...Pretty weird, huh? Phoenix: (Like Larry knows anything about this stuff!) Pearl: There's something else that was strange about my mother's letter... The seal on it was broken, as if someone had already opened it once before. Butz: ...That sure is pretty strange. Phoenix: (Someone had opened it already?) Burnt Letter updated in the Court Record. Morgan's letter (subsequent times) Pearl: My mother has gone to a place called a \"penitentiary\". Phoenix: Yeah...

Phoenix: (Someone had opened it already?) Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: After dinner on the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Elise Deauxnim's room, reading a book together, correct? Pearl: Yes! I was so happy when she invited me! But... I didn't go in the end. Phoenix: You didn't go...? Pearl: ... No. There was somewhere else I had to go instead. I was so worried, I... I had to go. I didn't know what to do with myself. I was so nervous. Phoenix: (So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room... Because she was too worried about something or someone else...) ...Pearls. On the night of the murder, you went to this place, didn't you...? Present anywhere Phoenix: Phoenix: You went here, didn't you Pearls? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Looks like she's still not going to open up to me.) This is where you went because you were so worried, right? Then the next question is, \"Who or what were you so worried about?\" Now, I'm going to take a guess, and you can tell me if I'm right or wrong, OK? Pearl: Y-You mean you know!? Phoenix: If I'm right, will you tell me the whole truth? Pearl: ... O-OK... Phoenix: You went to this place for one very simple reason, and that is this: Present Maya Fey profile (after presenting Inner Temple) Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls.\" Otherwise Phoenix: Phoenix: Well Pearls? This is what you were worrying about, right? Pearl: ... There's something I'm worrying about right now, actually. Phoenix: What's that? Pearl: You, Mr. Nick. Your face has turned a really strange color. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You shouldn't work so hard, you know. You need to take a break once in a while. Phoenix: (...Being chided by a 9 year old. How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this! (I guess I'm going to have to think this through one more time from the very beginning.) Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: You knew the training Maya was undertaking was dangerous. After all, it was the Special Course. Pearl: ... Maya: I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why. The reason you were so worried about that bell was because of this: Present Burnt Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... You know, Mr. Nick, I think you should take a break now. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Even your hair's starting to look a bit tired. The spikes aren't looking so sharp. Phoenix: (Looks like picking this piece of evidence wasn't so sharp of me, either.) ...A-Anyway! You said you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell... Leads back to: \"Huh!? Oh! I...\" Phoenix: You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: I presume you recognize these pieces of paper? Pearl: Aaaaah! Wh-Where did you...? Phoenix: In the incinerator at the Inner Temple. Pearls... You were following the instructions in this letter that night, weren't you? That's why you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell. Pearl: I... I'm speechless, Mr. Nick! You're amazing! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: These instructions that were found in the incinerator... I believe they were written for you, Pearls. Pearl: For me!? I... No... Phoenix: As you can see, a large portion has been burnt... But the last section is still fairly legible. \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" Pearl: ... Phoenix: Who was it, Pearls? Whose spirit were you supposed to be channeling? Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: (Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it... ...whose spirit would Pearls have been trying to channel? Don't over-think it, Phoenix! It's pretty obvious who Pearls was supposed to channel...) The person you were trying to channel that night, Pearls, was... Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Pearls? Am I right? Pearl: I... I can't channel anyone anymore. Pearl: A spirit medium who can't channel spirits... is like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: (Poor kid. It's really getting her down.) Pearl: But... I have never channeled that person's spirit! Phoenix: (I should have all the evidence I need, so what am I not getting here...?) Leads back to: \"Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it...\" Phoenix: It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter. Pearl: Ah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (It's just as I suspected... It wasn't Iris who Sister Bikini met at the Inner Temple that night... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Do you know anything about her, Pearls? Do you know what kind of a woman Dahlia Hawthorne was? Pearl: Umm... no. I've never heard of anyone by that name before reading those instructions... Phoenix: (I thought so. Pearls doesn't have a clue. She doesn't know that Dahlia is her sister...) About the instructions in the letter I found, Pearls... Who wrote them? Pearl: Umm... Phoenix: Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of... You must have quite a lot of respect for them. Pearl: ... Phoenix: After all, you followed their instructions without question. So here's my next question. Who wrote this set of instructions for you to follow...? Present Morgan Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Pearls... I have to wonder about something...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the person who wrote the instructions, isn't it Pearls? You must have had a lot of faith in them to follow their instructions to a tee! Pearl: ... I... I had a lot of faith... in you, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Oh! Thanks! Pearl: But... ...I don't think I can trust you anymore. Phoenix: (Ouch... Pearls sure can be blunt when she wants to be... Alright now, think! Someone who Pearls would trust, no questions asked... There can't be many candidates for that post.) Leads back to: \"Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of...\" Phoenix: Pearls... I have to wonder about something... You didn't have any idea what these instructions meant, did you? Pearl: ...*ba-dump* Phoenix: But you followed them to the letter regardless. Why? Because it was your own mother who asked you. That's why. Pearl: H-How did you...? Phoenix: I figured it out. The person who wrote you this letter was your own mother, Morgan Fey! Pearl: Uh... Waaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Alright, Pearls! It's time you started telling me the truth. Pearl: M-M-Mr. N-Nick... I-I-I... Phoenix: (Why's she holding back from me? I don't like this...) Pearl: D-D-Don't underestimate m-me, j-just because I'm a ch-child! Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: If you're trying to say I followed these instructions... I'd l-like to see some proof! Phoenix: Whaaaat!? Pearl: Because... I... I d-don't think y-y-you have a-a-any! Phoenix: Nnnnnngh... (She'd say anything rather than admit to carrying out those instructions... I guess I'll have to produce some more evidence, then. One more thing should do it.) ...Alright, Pearls. We both know someone carried out these instructions on the night of the murder. But you're right. There's no evidence that proves it was you. Pearl: I-I-I knew it! Phoenix: However... I do know that whoever did it was a child. Pearl: Huh? H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: It couldn't have been an adult... No adult would've made a simple mistake like that. Pearl: A... simple mistake? What do you mean by that? Phoenix: I'm sure you thought you were carefully following the instructions you'd been given. But you misunderstood some of the words, and this is the evidence that proves it! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This shows the mistake you made! Pearl: ... Umm... I guess you know what I'm about to say, huh? I don't think it's me who made a mistake, Mr. Nick. It's you. Phoenix: (But the person who read these instructions must have been a child. That's why they misunderstood the meaning of that word... It's the only explanation for how such a simple mistake could've been made!) OK, Pearls. I'll go over it again. The person who read these instructions... Leads back to: \"It couldn't have been an adult...\" Phoenix: It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Wh-What!? Wh-Why would I d-do something like...? Phoenix: Do you remember what was written in that letter? \"Gravely roast the Master in the fires of Hades and bring our vengeance to fruition.\" But you didn't know how to read the words \"gravely\" and \"roast\" among others, right? Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea... Phoenix: Just a tiny bit. Pearl: I... I really am useless! I couldn't even burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me... (Changed from [I didn't even manage to burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me...] in the original release) Such a simple thing...

Godot: The entrance to the Sacred Cavern looks like a freaking puzzle workshop. Phoenix: (I guess he's talking about Iris and the lock-breaking effort...) Godot: ...But it's all a waste of time. Phoenix: W-Why do you say that? Godot: Because Maya Fey isn't coming back. Phoenix: What? You don't know what you're talking about! How can you say something like that? Godot: It was your job to protect her, Trite. Just like it was your job to protect Mia Fey... Two sisters, caught up in the worst circumstances. Phoenix: I... I realize that, but... Godot: And you were the only one who was by their sides. You were the only one who could have saved them. Phoenix: But I didn't know anything about what was going on! Godot: Ha...!

The investigation is still going on, so I wasn't allowed into the Inner Temple.Pearl: Oh, I see... So is Sister Iris still trying to remove those trick locks in the Training Hall?Phoenix: No... She's the defendant in this case, so she can't be at the Inner Temple. She's required to be here in court.Pearl: Um... Then... How come she's not here in the defendant's lobby?Phoenix: (I have to admit it's kinda strange...)???: ...If you're looking for Iris, she's in the prosecutor's lobby.Phoenix: ...Ed-Edgeworth. What's Iris doing over there?Edgeworth: She's going over today's testimony with the prosecutor as we speak.Phoenix: Today's testimony...?Edgeworth: You heard me... Iris is going to be testifying as a witness for the prosecution.Phoenix: Wait, what!?Edgeworth: The prosecutor is squeezing her for a confession. ...Or so I heard.Phoenix: (Franziska von Karma... What are you up to...?)Edgeworth: I know what you're thinking, but Franziska isn't going to be the prosecutor today.Phoenix: What...!? Then who is?Edgeworth: Who else would it be but Godot?Phoenix: G-Godot...Edgeworth: ...Franziska is engaged in some important work at the Sacred Cavern.Pearl: The Sacred Cavern...? You don't mean that she's...Edgeworth: Exactly. She has been out there all night, trying to remove those trick locks. With the head nun's assistance, naturally. We estimate that the last of the locks should be taken care of in about three hours. I hope everything continues to go smoothly and we receive some good news soon.Phoenix: Yeah...

Umm... Your Honor...? Wh-What are you...?Judge: Who? Me? Well, my little brother came to visit me in my chambers earlier this morning. All of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, he developed a scorching fever and fainted! Therefore, I'll be standing in for him.Phoenix: I-I see, Your Honor... (So they're brothers! That explains a lot...)Judge: My poor brother. He looked a bit pale, not to mention sad that he couldn't be here.Godot: It is impossible to predict what the future has in store for any of us. This is precisely why people feel the need to judge the past. And we of the court have been charged with the solemn duty of passing such judgment.Judge: ...Well said, Mr. Godot. I understood exactly what you said... at least up until the end, anyway. Now then, Mr. Godot. Please proceed with your opening statement.Godot: ...Humans are fragile, fickle beings. Our hearts change with the shifting of the tides. There is only one thing that remains a constant in this crazy world... The bitter darkness that lies at the bottom of this mug.Judge: So then you mean...? Um... Forget it. What do you mean?Godot: During yesterday's trial, the accused refused to admit her role in the crime. But today, she has had a change of heart... Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple has a confession to make.Judge: C-Confession...! Th-The defendant...?Phoenix: (Iris... Why didn't she discuss this with me first...?)Judge: Very well. This court will now hear the defendant's confession!Godot: ...Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.Iris: ...Um, my name is Iris. I am but a simple nun undergoing training at Hazakura Temple.Judge: Witness, is there something that you want to confess to?Iris: ...Yes. But first, I want to apologize to Mr. Wright... I... I can't continue lying to everyone anymore.Phoenix: I-It's alright... What is it...?Iris: Mr. Wright, I have to admit that I... I did play a part in this terrible incident.Judge: Are... Are you actually confessing!? Are you saying that you were the one who murdered Ms. Elise Deauxnim?Iris: ...No, I'm not, Your Honor. But I dealt with the cover up, after the murder took place. After her spirit left, I took the lifeless shell of Mystic Elise... ...and carried it to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard where I desecrated it.Judge: Wh... Whaaaat!? O-Order in the court! Order! W-Witness...! Are you... Are you saying you were an accomplice to the murder!?Iris: ... Yes. That's correct.Phoenix: ...Whaaaaaaat!? (Three minutes in court and I'm already covered in a cold sweat...)Godot: Ha...! Everyone on the planet is an accomplice to something. It just happens to be that in this case, it's to murder. Isn't that right... Mr. Trite?Phoenix: (Grrr, that Godot... So this is the confession they were conferring about! It pains me to say this... ...but it looks like Iris's testimony was all a lie.)Iris's Testimony crumpled up and shoved into a pocket.Godot: Now then, little lady. If you don't mind, I've got a question for you. Whose crime were you trying to cover up by your actions?Phoenix: (Iris was covering for someone...? Nngh... Now I'm definitely up the creek without a paddle... or a lifejacket.)Iris: ...I've been at Hazakura Temple ever since I was a little girl. Hazakura Temple is run by one of the branch families of the Kurain Tradition. One of our missions is to protect the main family.Judge: I'm sorry, but \"main family\"...?Iris: Yes, and that's why I would dirty myself, if need be, to protect her... The daughter of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Maya Fey!Phoenix: Huh...?Godot: Wake up and smell the coffee, Trite.Phoenix: Sh-She's naming... MAYAAAAAAAAA!?Judge: Order! Order in the court! So not only did you witness the murder... You know the name of the murderer!Iris: I'm terribly sorry... But it's true. I saw her commit the crime with my very own eyes... And then I cleaned up the area to try to protect her.Phoenix:Phoenix: Th-That's ridiculous! Maya could never do such a--Judge: The defense will refrain from commenting until the appropriate time. Now, witness. Let's hear your testimony. What exactly happened on the night of the crime?Iris: ... ...Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix: (I thought I was prepared for the unexpected... But I never imagined the case would wind up going in this direction...)Witness Testimony-- The Real Murderer --Iris: I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden. I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff! While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike! Mystic Maya tried desperately to defend herself and stole the weapon...! It was only in self-defense! You can't blame her for it!Judge: So it was in self-defense?Iris: Yes. Mystic Elise was the one who attacked first!Judge: Hmm...Iris: That's why I tried my best to protect Mystic Maya!Godot: You moved the victim's body to the temple so that Maya wouldn't be suspected... Isn't that right? Not bad... You've got the instincts of a true criminal.Phoenix: (Something's not quite right. I'm sure it was established yesterday... ...that Iris never went to the Inner Temple that night. And that the person who did go was... that woman... ...Iris even admitted it.)Judge: Now then, Mr. Wright. Please proceed with your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Real Murderer --Iris: I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Sister Iris! Your testimony has changed quite a bit since yesterday. You stated yesterday that, on the night of the murder, you didn't go to the Inner Temple. Godot: Godot: Did she now? Too bad for you, what she said yesterday doesn't mean much today. By the way, where were you when she claimed that she didn't go? Phoenix: Umm, I... It was in the Inner Temple's Training Hall... Godot: A private conversation between the two of you does not constitute testimony. That would be properly described as hearsay. Judge: Hmm... What do you have to say, witness? Iris: I-I just couldn't tell him the truth at that time. Mystic Maya... She's your girlfriend, isn't she? Phoenix: ...! Iris: I... I didn't want to be the one to break it to you that I saw her commit murder... Judge: There, there... We all understand how difficult this is for you. Now then, let's continue with the testimony. What did you witness in the temple garden...? Iris: Well, Your Honor...Iris: I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're saying that the victim attacked Maya... I mean Ms. Fey? Iris: Y-Yes... It was a truly frightening scene. Mystic Maya was struck hard on the head and looked like she was going to collapse. Phoenix: What were you doing at the time? Iris: Um... Phoenix: Why didn't you stop them from fighting!? Iris: I-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wright... I was... I was frightened... I couldn't move... I couldn't even speak, I was in such shock... Judge: Hmm... That's perfectly understandable, my dear. Phoenix: (This doesn't sound right... I don't believe this testimony for a minute!) Judge: ...What happened after that?Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey. Iris: Ho-How can you be so sure...? Phoenix: Because the victim's real name was not \"Elise Deauxnim\". Her real name was... \"Misty Fey\". Judge: ...\"Fey\"? Iris: Aaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey! Judge: Wh-Who is this Misty Fey? Is she related to...? Phoenix: Misty Fey is the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She is also... ...the mother of Maya Fey! Judge: A-Are you serious!? Iris: Is it... really true? Mr. Wright...!? Was Elise Deauxnim actually the great Mystic Misty!? Phoenix: There's no doubt about it. (It looks like Iris had no idea...) Iris: I can hardly believe it... Phoenix: The idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing! Godot: ...Ugh...! Judge: Order in the court!! There's no doubt about it. This certainly is odd. I find it difficult to believe that a mother would try to kill her own daughter! Godot: Ha...! If it turns out that I'm wrong about this... I'll quit my day job and open up a coffee house. Judge: Hmm... Godot: I'd like to believe that domestic violence cases like these never occur, but... ...unfortunately, they're all too common. That's why people drink bitter coffee, you know. Judge: You've brought to light a very interesting fact, Mr. Wright... But I must agree with the prosecution that domestic violence is not all that rare. Phoenix: Y-You don't mean...!? Judge: The fact that they were mother and daughter doesn't itself disprove the witness's claims. I think it would be best if we returned to the testimony at hand. Iris: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Phoenix: (Somehow... It looks like I'm gonna have to find another contradiction in her testimony. Something more conclusive than this!)Iris: While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She moved in to deliver a fatal strike? Iris: ...Yes, I'm sure of it. She threw down her staff and reached into her robe for a weapon... Phoenix: Wait a minute! What was this weapon...? Iris: It-It was... some kind of dagger. Phoenix: (A dagger, huh...?) And Elise Deauxnim tried to stab her with this weapon? ...To kill Ms. Fey? Iris: Yes... Exactly. Phoenix: ... Godot: Ha...! You look like I did after I mistakenly took a swig of Worcestershire sauce. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Do you have a problem with the testimony we're hearing from your client, Lawyer Boy? Phoenix: (Hmm... Do I have a problem with Iris's testimony...?) No problem Phoenix: (Iris is my client... I'd better not press her too hard...) The defense has no objection to Ms. Iris's testimony. Godot: Ha...! You should try some nice, sweet caf\u00e9 con leche at least once, Trite... Judge: Very well, let's continue with your testimony. What happened to Ms. Fey when she was attacked by the victim? Leads back to cross-examination There is one thing... Phoenix: ...Your Honor. I have a small problem with the witness's testimony. Judge: Y-You do? But this witness is your own client! Phoenix: Yes, well... N-Nevertheless... Godot: ...That's fine. Witness, let's add your last statement to the testimony. Iris: Y-Yes, sir. Judge: H-Hey! Just a moment! It's my job to say that... Godot: ...Listen, gramps. I won't say it again. Final judgment will be rendered by me! Judge: Nnngghh...! Godot: ...OK, now. Let's continue.

Iris: I can hardly believe it... Phoenix: The idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing! Godot: ...Ugh...! Judge: Order in the court!! There's no doubt about it. This certainly is odd. I find it difficult to believe that a mother would try to kill her own daughter! Godot: Ha...! If it turns out that I'm wrong about this... I'll quit my day job and open up a coffee house.

Iris: Mystic Elise was trying to kill Mystic Maya. I think that's why she wanted a more lethal weapon. Judge: It's true... It's not easy to inflict a deadly blow with a staff. Phoenix: Sister Iris, let me make sure I've got this straight. The victim herself chose to throw away her staff? Iris: Y-Yes. That's what I saw... Judge: Is there anything odd about that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ... (Yeah, it's odd alright.) Iris: Mystic Elise attacked Mystic Maya with the dagger. I'm sure of this.Present Victim's Staff (if Elise Deauxnim profile was presented on any statement other than first) Phoenix: Phoenix: Sister Iris... There's something strange about your version of events. Iris: Huh...? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim throwing her staff away makes no sense at all to me. Iris: B-But all you can do with a staff is hit someone... Phoenix: Naturally you wouldn't know this, Sister Iris, but... ...the victim's staff had a special feature about it. As you can see, it's a sword. Iris: Ah...! Phoenix: If Elise Deauxnim really had wanted to kill Maya Fey... ...she wouldn't have needed to use a separate dagger!

Godot: Godot: ...That was an impressive bit of investigating, Trite. I never would have thought there was a sword hidden in that staff. But even so... How should I put this? Phoenix: ...! Godot: A long sword is unwieldy, and thus quite ineffective in close-quarters combat. Maybe that's why she chose a dagger over her blade. Phoenix: Um, well... Godot: Anyway, the type of weapon she chose to use isn't what's important. The important thing is that she tried to kill Maya Fey. As long as there's nothing strange about that, there's no problem with her testimony. Phoenix: (But there is something strange about this whole testimony!) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? The prosecution has a point. Phoenix: ...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument. Iris: M-Mr. Wright...!

    "cot": "Okay, let me try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, the testimonies are from Iris, where she claims that Elise attacked Maya with a dagger after throwing her staff away. The key points in her testimony are that Elise discarded her staff and then used a dagger to attack.\n\nLooking at the evidences, there's the Victim's Staff (Evidence 9) which has a hidden sword inside. The description says that the staff actually contains a sword, which Elise could have used instead of needing a separate dagger. \n\nSo if Iris's testimony (Testimony 3) says Elise threw away the staff and pulled out a dagger, but the staff itself had a concealed sword, then that's a contradiction. Why would Elise throw away a weapon that already has a blade inside to use a different weapon? The staff's hidden sword would have been more than sufficient for the attack, making the need for a dagger unnecessary and thus contradicting Iris's statement about the dagger."

That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Judge: A c-crystal sphere...!? Butz: This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers! von Karma: That sphere... Where did you find it? Butz: Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right. Edgeworth: And it was half-buried in the snow...? Butz: It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood.

Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na\u00efve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris! Iris: ... Phoenix: (Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?) To be continued. February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Edgeworth: Wright, is this what Godot was talking about? Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask\u2606DeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: \u266aNo motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!\u266a \u266a...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...\u266a Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! \u266aGood cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...\u266a Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting\u00a0??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month.

She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you. (I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant secret left to unlock... Pearls's Psyche-Lock...) [sic] Revenge (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...)

Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: I think it's time you told the truth about what you were doing on that night. Iris: ... Phoenix: You said you were in your room at Hazakura Temple the entire time. Do you still claim that to be the truth? Iris: Yes... That's where I was. Phoenix: Iris... I believe you're innocent. That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder! Present Bikini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Iris!? I trust you, so you need to trust me. Iris: But, Mr. Wright... I can't. Phoenix: Why not? Iris: I can't trust such random nonsense! It doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I screwed up there...) Leads back to: \"Iris... I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... But mistakes just don't suit you. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: I had hoped you would get at least this much correct. I hate seeing you mess up and getting all disappointed. Phoenix: (Nngh... I didn't know she could be so harsh...) Phoenix: Iris, what are you trying to hide...? Iris: ...! Phoenix: The more you lie about it, the more I know it's got to be something really important. Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with?

Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" There were two of you. Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

Phoenix: (I think I've pretty much got all the evidence I need. Now I just need to find out what Pearls is hiding.) Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: I... After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?) Butz: It must've been pretty scary for you, Pearl. I know what it's like. Nick used to leave me behind when I fell asleep at school, too. Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure. I couldn't even grant my mother's final wish... Phoenix: Her \"final wish\"...? Pearl: Yes.

Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Usually, a picture is enough to channel someone's spirit, but this time... Butz: ...Pretty weird, huh? Phoenix: (Like Larry knows anything about this stuff!)

Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: You knew the training Maya was undertaking was dangerous. After all, it was the Special Course. Pearl: ... Maya: I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why. The reason you were so worried about that bell was because of this: Present Burnt Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... You know, Mr. Nick, I think you should take a break now. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Even your hair's starting to look a bit tired. The spikes aren't looking so sharp. Phoenix: (Looks like picking this piece of evidence wasn't so sharp of me, either.) ...A-Anyway! You said you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell... Leads back to: \"Huh!? Oh! I...\" Phoenix: You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: I presume you recognize these pieces of paper? Pearl: Aaaaah! Wh-Where did you...? Phoenix: In the incinerator at the Inner Temple. Pearls... You were following the instructions in this letter that night, weren't you? That's why you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell. Pearl: I... I'm speechless, Mr. Nick! You're amazing! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: These instructions that were found in the incinerator... I believe they were written for you, Pearls. Pearl: For me!? I... No... Phoenix: As you can see, a large portion has been burnt... But the last section is still fairly legible. \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" Pearl: ... Phoenix: Who was it, Pearls? Whose spirit were you supposed to be channeling? Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: (Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it... ...whose spirit would Pearls have been trying to channel? Don't over-think it, Phoenix! It's pretty obvious who Pearls was supposed to channel...) The person you were trying to channel that night, Pearls, was... Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Pearls? Am I right? Pearl: I... I can't channel anyone anymore. Pearl: A spirit medium who can't channel spirits... is like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: (Poor kid. It's really getting her down.) Pearl: But... I have never channeled that person's spirit! Phoenix: (I should have all the evidence I need, so what am I not getting here...?) Leads back to: \"Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it...\" Phoenix: It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter. Pearl: Ah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (It's just as I suspected... It wasn't Iris who Sister Bikini met at the Inner Temple that night... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Do you know anything about her, Pearls? Do you know what kind of a woman Dahlia Hawthorne was? Pearl: Umm... no. I've never heard of anyone by that name before reading those instructions... Phoenix: (I thought so. Pearls doesn't have a clue. She doesn't know that Dahlia is her sister...) About the instructions in the letter I found, Pearls... Who wrote them? Pearl: Umm... Phoenix: Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of... You must have quite a lot of respect for them. Pearl: ... Phoenix: After all, you followed their instructions without question. So here's my next question. Who wrote this set of instructions for you to follow...? Present Morgan Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Pearls... I have to wonder about something...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the person who wrote the instructions, isn't it Pearls? You must have had a lot of faith in them to follow their instructions to a tee! Pearl: ... I... I had a lot of faith... in you, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Oh! Thanks! Pearl: But... ...I don't think I can trust you anymore. Phoenix: (Ouch... Pearls sure can be blunt when she wants to be... Alright now, think! Someone who Pearls would trust, no questions asked... There can't be many candidates for that post.) Leads back to: \"Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of...\" Phoenix: Pearls... I have to wonder about something... You didn't have any idea what these instructions meant, did you? Pearl: ...*ba-dump* Phoenix: But you followed them to the letter regardless. Why? Because it was your own mother who asked you. That's why. Pearl: H-How did you...? Phoenix: I figured it out. The person who wrote you this letter was your own mother, Morgan Fey! Pearl: Uh... Waaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Alright, Pearls! It's time you started telling me the truth. Pearl: M-M-Mr. N-Nick... I-I-I... Phoenix: (Why's she holding back from me? I don't like this...) Pearl: D-D-Don't underestimate m-me, j-just because I'm a ch-child! Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: If you're trying to say I followed these instructions... I'd l-like to see some proof! Phoenix: Whaaaat!? Pearl: Because... I... I d-don't think y-y-you have a-a-any! Phoenix: Nnnnnngh... (She'd say anything rather than admit to carrying out those instructions... I guess I'll have to produce some more evidence, then. One more thing should do it.) ...Alright, Pearls. We both know someone carried out these instructions on the night of the murder. But you're right. There's no evidence that proves it was you. Pearl: I-I-I knew it! Phoenix: However... I do know that whoever did it was a child. Pearl: Huh? H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: It couldn't have been an adult... No adult would've made a simple mistake like that. Pearl: A... simple mistake? What do you mean by that? Phoenix: I'm sure you thought you were carefully following the instructions you'd been given. But you misunderstood some of the words, and this is the evidence that proves it! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This shows the mistake you made! Pearl: ... Umm... I guess you know what I'm about to say, huh? I don't think it's me who made a mistake, Mr. Nick. It's you. Phoenix: (But the person who read these instructions must have been a child. That's why they misunderstood the meaning of that word... It's the only explanation for how such a simple mistake could've been made!) OK, Pearls. I'll go over it again. The person who read these instructions... Leads back to: \"It couldn't have been an adult...\" Phoenix: It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Wh-What!? Wh-Why would I d-do something like...? Phoenix: Do you remember what was written in that letter? \"Gravely roast the Master in the fires of Hades and bring our vengeance to fruition.\" But you didn't know how to read the words \"gravely\" and \"roast\" among others, right? Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea... Phoenix: Just a tiny bit. Pearl: I... I really am useless! I couldn't even burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me... (Changed from [I didn't even manage to burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me...] in the original release) Such a simple thing... And I couldn't even do it right... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful After clearing \"The night of the crime\" and \"Morgan's letter\" Talk options: Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. You really helped me out. Pearl: You're very welcome! My mother is watching over us! So I'm sure Mystic Maya will be alright! Phoenix: ... (Look at that innocent smile on her face. What am I supposed to say to her?) ???: Ha...! Godot: Finally figured it out, have you, Trite? You've finally realized how terrible of a crime being painfully oblivious is. Phoenix: G-Godot! Godot: The entrance to the Sacred Cavern looks like a freaking puzzle workshop. Phoenix: (I guess he's talking about Iris and the lock-breaking effort...) Godot: ...But it's all a waste of time. Phoenix: W-Why do you say that? Godot: Because Maya Fey isn't coming back. Phoenix: What? You don't know what you're talking about! How can you say something like that? Godot: It was your job to protect her, Trite. Just like it was your job to protect Mia Fey... Two sisters, caught up in the worst circumstances. Phoenix: I... I realize that, but... Godot: And you were the only one who was by their sides. You were the only one who could have saved them. Phoenix: But I didn't know anything about what was going on! Godot: Ha...! What did I just say, Trite? Being oblivious is a heinous crime in itself. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Tomorrow... We'll settle everything in court tomorrow. ...Once and for all. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick... Is... Is what that man just said true? Phoenix: It'll be alright, Pearls. I'm sure Maya's alive. You'll see for yourself tomorrow! Pearl: I... Yeah! That's right! I know I can trust you, Mr. Nick! Morgan: ...My dear Pearl... ...You've done so well, my child. My Pearl... ...It's better that you don't know what you've done...

I'm not exactly a wiz at machinery, you know...)\n-- The Real Murderer --Iris: I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Sister Iris! Your testimony has changed quite a bit since yesterday. You stated yesterday that, on the night of the murder, you didn't go to the Inner Temple. Godot: Godot: Did she now? Too bad for you, what she said yesterday doesn't mean much today. By the way, where were you when she claimed that she didn't go? Phoenix: Umm, I... It was in the Inner Temple's Training Hall... Godot: A private conversation between the two of you does not constitute testimony. That would be properly described as hearsay. Judge: Hmm... What do you have to say, witness? Iris: I-I just couldn't tell him the truth at that time. Mystic Maya... She's your girlfriend, isn't she? Phoenix: ...! Iris: I... I didn't want to be the one to break it to you that I saw her commit murder... Judge: There, there... We all understand how difficult this is for you. Now then, let's continue with the testimony. What did you witness in the temple garden...? Iris: Well, Your Honor...Iris: I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're saying that the victim attacked Maya... I mean Ms. Fey? Iris: Y-Yes... It was a truly frightening scene. Mystic Maya was struck hard on the head and looked like she was going to collapse. Phoenix: What were you doing at the time? Iris: Um... Phoenix: Why didn't you stop them from fighting!? Iris: I-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wright... I was... I was frightened... I couldn't move... I couldn't even speak, I was in such shock... Judge: Hmm... That's perfectly understandable, my dear. Phoenix: (This doesn't sound right... I don't believe this testimony for a minute!) Judge: ...What happened after that?Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey. Iris: Ho-How can you be so sure...? Phoenix: Because the victim's real name was not \"Elise Deauxnim\". Her real name was... \"Misty Fey\". Judge: ...\"Fey\"? Iris: Aaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey! Judge: Wh-Who is this Misty Fey? Is she related to...? Phoenix: Misty Fey is the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She is also... ...the mother of Maya Fey! Judge: A-Are you serious!? Iris: Is it... really true? Mr. Wright...!? Was Elise Deauxnim actually the great Mystic Misty!? Phoenix: There's no doubt about it. (It looks like Iris had no idea...) Iris: I can hardly believe it... Phoenix: The idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing! Godot: ...Ugh...! Judge: Order in the court!! There's no doubt about it. This certainly is odd. I find it difficult to believe that a mother would try to kill her own daughter! Godot: Ha...! If it turns out that I'm wrong about this... I'll quit my day job and open up a coffee house. Judge: Hmm... Godot: I'd like to believe that domestic violence cases like these never occur, but... ...unfortunately, they're all too common. That's why people drink bitter coffee, you know. Judge: You've brought to light a very interesting fact, Mr. Wright... But I must agree with the prosecution that domestic violence is not all that rare. Phoenix: Y-You don't mean...!? Judge: The fact that they were mother and daughter doesn't itself disprove the witness's claims. I think it would be best if we returned to the testimony at hand. Iris: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Phoenix: (Somehow... It looks like I'm gonna have to find another contradiction in her testimony. Something more conclusive than this!)Iris: While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She moved in to deliver a fatal strike? Iris: ...Yes, I'm sure of it. She threw down her staff and reached into her robe for a weapon... Phoenix: Wait a minute! What was this weapon...? Iris: It-It was... some kind of dagger. Phoenix: (A dagger, huh...?) And Elise Deauxnim tried to stab her with this weapon? ...To kill Ms. Fey? Iris: Yes... Exactly. Phoenix: ... Godot: Ha...! You look like I did after I mistakenly took a swig of Worcestershire sauce. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Do you have a problem with the testimony we're hearing from your client, Lawyer Boy? Phoenix: (Hmm... Do I have a problem with Iris's testimony...?) No problem Phoenix: (Iris is my client... I'd better not press her too hard...) The defense has no objection to Ms. Iris's testimony. Godot: Ha...! You should try some nice, sweet caf\u00e9 con leche at least once, Trite... Judge: Very well, let's continue with your testimony. What happened to Ms. Fey when she was attacked by the victim? Leads back to cross-examination There is one thing... Phoenix: ...Your Honor. I have a small problem with the witness's testimony. Judge: Y-You do? But this witness is your own client! Phoenix: Yes, well... N-Nevertheless... Godot: ...That's fine. Witness, let's add your last statement to the testimony. Iris: Y-Yes, sir. Judge: H-Hey! Just a moment! It's my job to say that... Godot: ...Listen, gramps. I won't say it again. Final judgment will be rendered by me! Judge: Nnngghh...! Godot: ...OK, now. Let's continue.

Something more conclusive than this!)Iris: She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She threw her staff away? Iris: Mystic Elise was trying to kill Mystic Maya. I think that's why she wanted a more lethal weapon. Judge: It's true... It's not easy to inflict a deadly blow with a staff. Phoenix: Sister Iris, let me make sure I've got this straight. The victim herself chose to throw away her staff? Iris: Y-Yes. That's what I saw... Judge: Is there anything odd about that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ... (Yeah, it's odd alright.) Iris: Mystic Elise attacked Mystic Maya with the dagger. I'm sure of this.Present Victim's Staff (if Elise Deauxnim profile was presented on any statement other than first) Phoenix: Phoenix: Sister Iris... There's something strange about your version of events. Iris: Huh...? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim throwing her staff away makes no sense at all to me. Iris: B-But all you can do with a staff is hit someone... Phoenix: Naturally you wouldn't know this, Sister Iris, but... ...the victim's staff had a special feature about it. As you can see, it's a sword. Iris: Ah...! Phoenix: If Elise Deauxnim really had wanted to kill Maya Fey... ...she wouldn't have needed to use a separate dagger! Not when she already had a beautiful blade in her hands already! Leads to: \"Order!

Godot: Godot: ...That was an impressive bit of investigating, Trite. I never would have thought there was a sword hidden in that staff. But even so... How should I put this? Phoenix: ...! Godot: A long sword is unwieldy, and thus quite ineffective in close-quarters combat. Maybe that's why she chose a dagger over her blade. Phoenix: Um, well... Godot: Anyway, the type of weapon she chose to use isn't what's important. The important thing is that she tried to kill Maya Fey. As long as there's nothing strange about that, there's no problem with her testimony. Phoenix: (But there is something strange about this whole testimony!) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? The prosecution has a point. Phoenix: ...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument. Iris: M-Mr. Wright...! Phoenix: I have here another piece of evidence that shows that this testimony can't be trusted. Because Ms. Elise Deauxnim would never attempt to take the life of Maya Fey! Present Elise Deauxnim profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Godot? Godot: If you ask me... ...the only thing that seems strange is the angle of Mr. Trite's index finger. Phoenix: Eh... Godot: Trite, sticking your finger in an electrical outlet might be safer for you. Otherwise it might get bitten off the next time you poke it in the wrong place! Phoenix: Arrrrgh...! (I still don't think that Ms. Deauxnim would ever attack Maya... If you think about their relationship, it's obvious!) Judge: ...Why don't you think it over one more time.

Iris: Is it... really true? Mr. Wright...!? Was Elise Deauxnim actually the great Mystic Misty!? Phoenix: There's no doubt about it. (It looks like Iris had no idea...) Iris: I can hardly believe it... Phoenix: The idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing! Godot: ...Ugh...! Judge: Order in the court!! There's no doubt about it. This certainly is odd. I find it difficult to believe that a mother would try to kill her own daughter! Godot: Ha...! If it turns out that I'm wrong about this... I'll quit my day job and open up a coffee house. Judge: Hmm... Godot: I'd like to believe that domestic violence cases like these never occur, but... ...unfortunately, they're all too common. That's why people drink bitter coffee, you know. Judge: You've brought to light a very interesting fact, Mr. Wright... But I must agree with the prosecution that domestic violence is not all that rare. Phoenix: Y-You don't mean...!? Judge: The fact that they were mother and daughter doesn't itself disprove the witness's claims. I think it would be best if we returned to the testimony at hand. Iris: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Phoenix: (Somehow... It looks like I'm gonna have to find another contradiction in her testimony. Something more conclusive than this!)Phoenix: (I'd like to avoid the whole spirit channeling thing if I can... Not only would it be inadmissible as evidence... ...but I think it might actually hurt our standing with the judge. First I need to pick her testimony apart and expose the unnatural-sounding parts... I don't know why Iris would tell a story like this... ...but there are two things I noticed that just don't add up!)Judge: Order! Order in the court! Upon first hearing the witness's testimony, it seemed natural enough. ...However. In light of some facts that have just been presented...Iris: ...Judge: One, that the victim supposedly threw away a sword during a fight... ...and two, that the two people battling to the death were mother and daughter... Despite the facts being believable when taken on their own... ...when taken together, the entire story seems difficult to believe.Godot: ...Listen. There's nothing in this world that is impossible. Except for one little thing.Judge: Yes? What is this one little impossible thing...?Godot: Ha...! You still don't get it. You think maybe my beans are under-roasted, but you have no idea gramps.Phoenix: Umm... Could you get to your point?Godot: I heard this witness's confession this morning... ...just as I had taken the first sip of my eighth cup of morning coffee.Judge: ...You're going to ruin your health, my friend.Godot: Anyway, after hearing this woman's confession... I had a detective who loves to investigate sent to the scene of the crime. And... he discovered this little beauty.Judge: Is that the dagger the witness testified to seeing...?Godot: Obviously, Your Honor... But do you not notice something else?Judge: ...Now that you mention it, if you look closely, there appears to be blood on it! (Changed from [...Now that you mention it, if you look closely, there appears to be a bloodstain!] in the original release)Phoenix: Wh-Where did you find that? I didn't see that when I investigated the crime scene!Godot: ...Did you investigate the pine tree at the crime scene?Phoenix: Huh? The pine tree...?Godot: This dagger was stuck in the back side of the pine tree. When the last blow was struck, ending the violent battle between the two women... ...this little baby was thrown in the direction of the back of the pine tree.Judge: Which means... the blood on this dagger belongs to the victim, correct!?Godot: Ha...! Were you even listening, old man? I first heard this confession this morning. Just as I had taken the first sip of my 13th cup of morning coffee.Phoenix: (Didn't you say it was your 8th just a few minutes ago!?)Godot: I didn't have enough time to get the blood analyzed on such short notice.Judge: In any case, the court will accept the dagger as evidence. Furthermore, I order that a blood test be performed on it immediately!Godot: This is my sweetheart. Make sure you treat her right.Judge: ...Bailiff! Get this piece of evidence to the crime lab for testing immediately!Dagger added to the Court Record.Judge: Now then... The testimony we've just heard had numerous unbelievable aspects to it. However! After having found the very dagger the witness spoke of... ...I believe we can consider her testimony to be credible.Godot: Cute girls never lie. Ever.Judge: In any case, witness... If you could please testify again to this court.Iris: Umm... About what, Your Honor?Judge: About the incident you saw... The battle between the two women!Iris: ...Yes, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- The Battle --Iris: Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff... But then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon! Suddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern. That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise! Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.Judge: ...That was a very heart-breaking story.Iris: I don't know if there were any bad feelings between them, but... It had been 17 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. ...Perhaps they simply didn't recognize each other anymore...Judge: Hmm... That seems reasonable. Now then, Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Battle --Iris: Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Iris, where were you standing when you witnessed all this? Iris: Umm... What do you mean? Phoenix: Well, if either of them had noticed you... ...they might not have continued their battle. Iris: I... I wonder if that's true... The two of them... They were standing near the garden's stone lantern. I... I was watching the whole thing from behind. It was dark where the two of them were, so... I think that's why they didn't see me. Judge: Hmm... So it was dark in the garden when the murder took place... Tell me, what did Ms. Maya Fey do after she was struck?Iris: But then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened to the victim's staff then? Iris: I-I'm not sure. The area was very dark, so... I really couldn't see. I think it got knocked away somewhere as the fight escalated. Judge: That makes sense... That would explain the need for the dagger. Iris: Mystic Elise raised the dagger to strike. But Mystic Maya dodged it at the last second. The dagger struck the lantern and fell to the ground. And then at some point, Mystic Maya picked it up...! Phoenix: (Nothing sounds especially strange yet...) Judge: What did the victim do when the weapon was stolen from her?Iris: Suddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're saying that Maya Fey turned the tables on the victim? Iris: Y-Yes... ...But Mystic Maya wasn't herself at the time. After all... Her life was in danger... Phoenix: (I still can't believe it... The idea of Maya cornering someone at knifepoint! It's just silly!) Godot: As they say... \"A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal\". Phoenix: I believe the correct description of a cornered fox is \"scared and petrified\". Godot: ... Your animal analogies have grown tiresome! Phoenix: (You were the one who started it!) Judge: Anyway... So, after Maya Fey backed the victim into the stone lantern, what happened next?Iris: That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that's what you saw!? Iris: ... Yes, I'm almost certain. Phoenix: \"Almost\"...? Iris: The garden was dark... I couldn't really tell who was who. Phoenix: (What did she just say!?) S-So in other words, it could have been someone else entirely...! Godot: Godot: We know that Maya Fey was at the Inner Temple that night. And that the woman that was killed was Elise Deauxnim. Isn't it fairly obvious who attacked who? Phoenix: Nnrgh... (I don't have anything to counter that yet...) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Please continue with your testimony. Iris: ...Yes, Your Honor. The two of them faced each other for a moment... Then Mystic Maya rushed straight into Mystic Elise! Then Mystic Elise doubled over and fell to the ground. Judge: Hmm... So she was stabbed in the stomach, huh? Iris: Yes...Present Elise's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!\"Iris: Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did that dagger go? Iris: ...I have no idea. It was dark and I couldn't see. Godot: According to the detective who found the dagger... ...it was stuck into the pine tree in the garden. Most likely it was flung towards the tree after the struggle. Judge: That is the most likely explanation, yes. Phoenix: After being stabbed in the stomach, did the victim collapse right away? Iris: ... Now that I think of it... ...she seemed to stare at Mystic Maya for a while. And Mystic Maya stood there, not moving an inch... It felt for a moment like time had just stopped. Judge: Hmm... Iris: But then, suddenly, as if the spell had worn off, Mystic Elise fell over...Phoenix: (It seems like a reasonable story at first... But... there's one thing that is completely impossible. The very idea of Maya stabbing someone... That alone is impossible! Which means... ...this faulty testimony must contain another contradiction in it somewhere.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. The testimonies are from Iris, describing the battle between Maya and Elise (who is actually Misty Fey). The key is to find an inconsistency between what Iris is saying and the evidence presented.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, the third one says, \"That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!\" Now, the evidence includes the autopsy report (Evidence 11) which states the cause of death was a stab wound in the back. However, Iris's testimony claims Maya stabbed Elise, but the autopsy report says the stab was in the back. If Maya was facing Elise during the attack as per Iris's description, the wound should be in the front. But the autopsy says the back, which contradicts the testimony. \n\nAdditionally, there's the Dagger (Evidence 19) found stuck in a pine tree. The blood on it doesn't match the victim's, which suggests the dagger wasn't the murder weapon. But Iris's testimony says the dagger was used to stab Elise. This discrepancy also points to a contradiction. However, the autopsy report directly contradicts the location of the wound, which is more straightforward. \n\nSo, the contradiction is between the autopsy report (Evidence 11) and the testimony that Maya stabbed Elise (Testimony 3), because the wound's location doesn't match the described action."

My girlfriend was flying through the sky! Almost 30 feet above the bridge! I felt like I might start flying myself. Edgeworth: (If only you'd be so kind as to fly out of all of our lives...!) Butz: Anyway! I completely lost myself when I was drawing this scene! Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just where did you see this sight from!? Butz: Hey! No need to shout... When I was lying in bed in that run-down shack... The crack of the lightning bolt made me realize that the bridge was burning. I just watched it for a while from there, thinking how nicely it was burning! Then after about five minutes, I saw it. von Karma: The defendant \"flying\"...? Butz: That's right! That's when I decided to go to the bridge! Judge: ...I see. That all makes sense. Aside from the sketch itself... Edgeworth: (Yes... This sketch doesn't make any sense... I just need to convince the artist that his work is ludicrous.) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry. What did you really see that night...?\" Butz: The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!

If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook! von Karma: An artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself.

Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway. von Karma: It did? Butz: That's right!

I guess he's not lying about that, at least.) von Karma: Phoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts. Judge: Aside from doubts of his humanity, eh... Edgeworth: (There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!) Edgeworth: Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care. Butz: In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth! Edgeworth: If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain. Judge: What might that be...? Edgeworth: That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris! Butz: W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh! von Karma: A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim? Edgeworth: ...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct? Butz: Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah! von Karma: It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench. Edgeworth: ...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder...

I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you! Edgeworth: W-What...!? Judge: What is the meaning of your outburst, witness!? Butz: ...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence. Edgeworth: \"Definitive\"...? von Karma: \"Evidence\"...? Butz: Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it! Judge: I didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality! Butz: ...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain! Edgeworth: (...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.) Witness Testimony -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Judge: A c-crystal sphere...!? Butz: This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers! von Karma: That sphere... Where did you find it? Butz: Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right. Edgeworth: And it was half-buried in the snow...? Butz: It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one! Butz: I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na\u00efve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?)

Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask\u2606DeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: \u266aNo motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!\u266a \u266a...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...\u266a Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! \u266aGood cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...\u266a Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting\u00a0??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia...

She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you. (I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant secret left to unlock... Pearls's Psyche-Lock...) [sic] Revenge (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...)

Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: I think it's time you told the truth about what you were doing on that night. Iris: ... Phoenix: You said you were in your room at Hazakura Temple the entire time. Do you still claim that to be the truth? Iris: Yes... That's where I was. Phoenix: Iris... I believe you're innocent. That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder! Present Bikini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Iris!? I trust you, so you need to trust me. Iris: But, Mr. Wright... I can't. Phoenix: Why not? Iris: I can't trust such random nonsense! It doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I screwed up there...) Leads back to: \"Iris... I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... But mistakes just don't suit you. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: I had hoped you would get at least this much correct. I hate seeing you mess up and getting all disappointed. Phoenix: (Nngh... I didn't know she could be so harsh...) Phoenix: Iris, what are you trying to hide...? Iris: ...! Phoenix: The more you lie about it, the more I know it's got to be something really important. Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with?

Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" There were two of you. Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

Phoenix: (I think I've pretty much got all the evidence I need. Now I just need to find out what Pearls is hiding.) Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: I... After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?) Butz: It must've been pretty scary for you, Pearl. I know what it's like. Nick used to leave me behind when I fell asleep at school, too. Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure. I couldn't even grant my mother's final wish... Phoenix: Her \"final wish\"...? Pearl: Yes.

Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.

This is what you were worrying about, right? Pearl: ... There's something I'm worrying about right now, actually. Phoenix: What's that? Pearl: You, Mr. Nick. Your face has turned a really strange color. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You shouldn't work so hard, you know. You need to take a break once in a while. Phoenix: (...Being chided by a 9 year old. How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this! (I guess I'm going to have to think this through one more time from the very beginning.) Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: You knew the training Maya was undertaking was dangerous. After all, it was the Special Course. Pearl: ... Maya: I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why. The reason you were so worried about that bell was because of this: Present Burnt Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... You know, Mr. Nick, I think you should take a break now. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Even your hair's starting to look a bit tired. The spikes aren't looking so sharp. Phoenix: (Looks like picking this piece of evidence wasn't so sharp of me, either.) ...A-Anyway! You said you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell... Leads back to: \"Huh!? Oh! I...\" Phoenix: You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: I presume you recognize these pieces of paper? Pearl: Aaaaah! Wh-Where did you...? Phoenix: In the incinerator at the Inner Temple. Pearls... You were following the instructions in this letter that night, weren't you? That's why you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell. Pearl: I... I'm speechless, Mr. Nick! You're amazing! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: These instructions that were found in the incinerator... I believe they were written for you, Pearls. Pearl: For me!? I... No... Phoenix: As you can see, a large portion has been burnt... But the last section is still fairly legible. \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" Pearl: ... Phoenix: Who was it, Pearls? Whose spirit were you supposed to be channeling? Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: (Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it... ...whose spirit would Pearls have been trying to channel? Don't over-think it, Phoenix! It's pretty obvious who Pearls was supposed to channel...) The person you were trying to channel that night, Pearls, was... Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Pearls? Am I right? Pearl: I... I can't channel anyone anymore. Pearl: A spirit medium who can't channel spirits... is like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: (Poor kid. It's really getting her down.) Pearl: But... I have never channeled that person's spirit! Phoenix: (I should have all the evidence I need, so what am I not getting here...?) Leads back to: \"Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it...\" Phoenix: It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter. Pearl: Ah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (It's just as I suspected... It wasn't Iris who Sister Bikini met at the Inner Temple that night... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Do you know anything about her, Pearls? Do you know what kind of a woman Dahlia Hawthorne was? Pearl: Umm... no. I've never heard of anyone by that name before reading those instructions... Phoenix: (I thought so. Pearls doesn't have a clue. She doesn't know that Dahlia is her sister...) About the instructions in the letter I found, Pearls... Who wrote them? Pearl: Umm... Phoenix: Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of... You must have quite a lot of respect for them. Pearl: ... Phoenix: After all, you followed their instructions without question. So here's my next question. Who wrote this set of instructions for you to follow...? Present Morgan Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Pearls... I have to wonder about something...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the person who wrote the instructions, isn't it Pearls? You must have had a lot of faith in them to follow their instructions to a tee! Pearl: ... I... I had a lot of faith... in you, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Oh! Thanks! Pearl: But... ...I don't think I can trust you anymore. Phoenix: (Ouch... Pearls sure can be blunt when she wants to be... Alright now, think! Someone who Pearls would trust, no questions asked... There can't be many candidates for that post.) Leads back to: \"Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of...\" Phoenix: Pearls... I have to wonder about something... You didn't have any idea what these instructions meant, did you? Pearl: ...*ba-dump* Phoenix: But you followed them to the letter regardless. Why? Because it was your own mother who asked you. That's why. Pearl: H-How did you...? Phoenix: I figured it out. The person who wrote you this letter was your own mother, Morgan Fey! Pearl: Uh... Waaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Alright, Pearls! It's time you started telling me the truth. Pearl: M-M-Mr. N-Nick... I-I-I... Phoenix: (Why's she holding back from me? I don't like this...) Pearl: D-D-Don't underestimate m-me, j-just because I'm a ch-child! Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: If you're trying to say I followed these instructions... I'd l-like to see some proof! Phoenix: Whaaaat!? Pearl: Because... I... I d-don't think y-y-you have a-a-any! Phoenix: Nnnnnngh... (She'd say anything rather than admit to carrying out those instructions... I guess I'll have to produce some more evidence, then. One more thing should do it.) ...Alright, Pearls. We both know someone carried out these instructions on the night of the murder. But you're right. There's no evidence that proves it was you. Pearl: I-I-I knew it! Phoenix: However... I do know that whoever did it was a child. Pearl: Huh? H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: It couldn't have been an adult... No adult would've made a simple mistake like that. Pearl: A... simple mistake? What do you mean by that? Phoenix: I'm sure you thought you were carefully following the instructions you'd been given. But you misunderstood some of the words, and this is the evidence that proves it! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This shows the mistake you made! Pearl: ... Umm... I guess you know what I'm about to say, huh? I don't think it's me who made a mistake, Mr. Nick. It's you. Phoenix: (But the person who read these instructions must have been a child. That's why they misunderstood the meaning of that word... It's the only explanation for how such a simple mistake could've been made!) OK, Pearls. I'll go over it again. The person who read these instructions... Leads back to: \"It couldn't have been an adult...\" Phoenix: It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Wh-What!? Wh-Why would I d-do something like...? Phoenix: Do you remember what was written in that letter? \"Gravely roast the Master in the fires of Hades and bring our vengeance to fruition.\" But you didn't know how to read the words \"gravely\" and \"roast\" among others, right? Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea... Phoenix: Just a tiny bit. Pearl: I... I really am useless! I couldn't even burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me... (Changed from [I didn't even manage to burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me...] in the original release) Such a simple thing... And I couldn't even do it right... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful After clearing \"The night of the crime\" and \"Morgan's letter\" Talk options: Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. You really helped me out. Pearl: You're very welcome! My mother is watching over us! So I'm sure Mystic Maya will be alright! Phoenix: ... (Look at that innocent smile on her face. What am I supposed to say to her?) ???: Ha...! Godot: Finally figured it out, have you, Trite? You've finally realized how terrible of a crime being painfully oblivious is. Phoenix: G-Godot! Godot: The entrance to the Sacred Cavern looks like a freaking puzzle workshop. Phoenix: (I guess he's talking about Iris and the lock-breaking effort...) Godot: ...But it's all a waste of time. Phoenix: W-Why do you say that? Godot: Because Maya Fey isn't coming back. Phoenix: What? You don't know what you're talking about! How can you say something like that? Godot: It was your job to protect her, Trite. Just like it was your job to protect Mia Fey... Two sisters, caught up in the worst circumstances. Phoenix: I... I realize that, but... Godot: And you were the only one who was by their sides. You were the only one who could have saved them. Phoenix: But I didn't know anything about what was going on! Godot: Ha...! What did I just say, Trite? Being oblivious is a heinous crime in itself. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Tomorrow... We'll settle everything in court tomorrow. ...Once and for all. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick... Is... Is what that man just said true? Phoenix: It'll be alright, Pearls. I'm sure Maya's alive. You'll see for yourself tomorrow! Pearl: I... Yeah! That's right! I know I can trust you, Mr. Nick! Morgan: ...My dear Pearl... ...You've done so well, my child. My Pearl... ...It's better that you don't know what you've done... (Changed from [...It's better that you don't know...] in the original release) ...I knew this day would come for you... ...The blood of the main family is no more... ...Now, finally... After all this time... the Master's seat is yours... (Changed from [...Now you... You are to take the place at the head of the Fey clan...] in the original release) ...My last, great wish... It seems I was just in time... To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Nothing to examine during metal detecting session Phoenix: Hmm... It doesn't look like there's anything here. Gumshoe: Hey, pal! All you gotta do is watch the detector and let IT tell YOU what's where, OK! (Changed from [Hey, pal! You've gotta watch the CHECK gauge and wait for it to flash, OK!?] in the original release) Phoenix: (Alright, already... I'm not exactly a wiz at machinery, you know...)\n-- The Battle --Iris: Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Iris, where were you standing when you witnessed all this? Iris: Umm... What do you mean? Phoenix: Well, if either of them had noticed you... ...they might not have continued their battle. Iris: I... I wonder if that's true... The two of them... They were standing near the garden's stone lantern. I... I was watching the whole thing from behind. It was dark where the two of them were, so... I think that's why they didn't see me. Judge: Hmm... So it was dark in the garden when the murder took place... Tell me, what did Ms. Maya Fey do after she was struck?Iris: But then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened to the victim's staff then? Iris: I-I'm not sure. The area was very dark, so... I really couldn't see. I think it got knocked away somewhere as the fight escalated. Judge: That makes sense... That would explain the need for the dagger. Iris: Mystic Elise raised the dagger to strike. But Mystic Maya dodged it at the last second. The dagger struck the lantern and fell to the ground. And then at some point, Mystic Maya picked it up...! Phoenix: (Nothing sounds especially strange yet...) Judge: What did the victim do when the weapon was stolen from her?Iris: Suddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You're saying that Maya Fey turned the tables on the victim? Iris: Y-Yes... ...But Mystic Maya wasn't herself at the time. After all... Her life was in danger... Phoenix: (I still can't believe it... The idea of Maya cornering someone at knifepoint! It's just silly!) Godot: As they say... \"A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal\". Phoenix: I believe the correct description of a cornered fox is \"scared and petrified\". Godot: ... Your animal analogies have grown tiresome! Phoenix: (You were the one who started it!) Judge: Anyway... So, after Maya Fey backed the victim into the stone lantern, what happened next?Iris: That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that's what you saw!? Iris: ... Yes, I'm almost certain. Phoenix: \"Almost\"...? Iris: The garden was dark... I couldn't really tell who was who. Phoenix: (What did she just say!?) S-So in other words, it could have been someone else entirely...! Godot: Godot: We know that Maya Fey was at the Inner Temple that night. And that the woman that was killed was Elise Deauxnim. Isn't it fairly obvious who attacked who? Phoenix: Nnrgh... (I don't have anything to counter that yet...) Judge: ...Well then, witness. Please continue with your testimony. Iris: ...Yes, Your Honor. The two of them faced each other for a moment... Then Mystic Maya rushed straight into Mystic Elise! Then Mystic Elise doubled over and fell to the ground. Judge: Hmm... So she was stabbed in the stomach, huh? Iris: Yes...Present Elise's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!\"Iris: Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did that dagger go? Iris: ...I have no idea. It was dark and I couldn't see. Godot: According to the detective who found the dagger... ...it was stuck into the pine tree in the garden. Most likely it was flung towards the tree after the struggle. Judge: That is the most likely explanation, yes. Phoenix: After being stabbed in the stomach, did the victim collapse right away? Iris: ... Now that I think of it... ...she seemed to stare at Mystic Maya for a while. And Mystic Maya stood there, not moving an inch... It felt for a moment like time had just stopped. Judge: Hmm... Iris: But then, suddenly, as if the spell had worn off, Mystic Elise fell over...Phoenix: (It seems like a reasonable story at first... But... there's one thing that is completely impossible. The very idea of Maya stabbing someone... That alone is impossible! Which means... ...this faulty testimony must contain another contradiction in it somewhere.)Phoenix: ...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!Iris: Huh...?Phoenix: Until now, I didn't think you were the type to make such a careless mistake. However! The testimony you just gave contains quite a few contradictions.Iris: Wh-What do you mean? What's so wrong about my testimony?Phoenix: According to you... ...Maya Fey stabbed the victim while she had her back to the stone lantern... Correct? (Changed from [...Maya Fey stabbed the victim, who had her back to the stone lantern... Correct?] in the original release)Iris: Y-Yes... That's right.Phoenix: But in that case, the victim would've been stabbed in the stomach, right?Judge: Y-Yes, I think so...Phoenix: But! According to the autopsy report... ...the cause of death was due to blood loss from a stab wound in her back.Iris: Ah...!Phoenix: This proves that the victim was stabbed from behind, not from the front! Sister Iris! It appears another seed of doubt has sprouted from your testimony!Iris: Aaaaaaaah!Judge: What...!? What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?Godot: Ha...! It's simple. People are like books. We've all got a front and a back. You get my drift?Judge: ... Umm, is that all you have to say?Godot: I can also say that darkness loves to play with the human mind.Phoenix:Phoenix: Could you please knock it off with the cheesy proverbs and illogical metaphors already!? The point is, too much of this testimony just doesn't make sense! Throwing away a useful staff, the people fighting being mother and daughter... And now, she falsely claims the victim was stabbed in the stomach!Judge: Hmm... There certainly are some inconsistencies.Phoenix: Well, Iris... How about it!?Iris: ... W-Well, it's just...Godot: If you ask me, you're just being too na\u00efve about the whole thing.Phoenix: What do you mean...?Godot: There are 253 distinct types of bitterness in coffee... But to pick out each one requires total concentration and the use of all the senses. Were you really concentrating on what this witness actually said?Judge: Prosecutor Godot! Explain yourself!Godot: The witness was quite unambigious [sic] about her own ambiguities when she said... ...that the garden was dark and she couldn't see clearly.Phoenix: ...!Godot: A human needs one thing to see clearly. And that is... light.Judge: Light...Godot: By the way, did you know? Hazakura has a rule that on nights when an acolyte is at the Inner Temple training... (Changed from [The Inner Temple has a rule that on nights when an acolyte is there training...] in the original release) ...the stone lantern in the garden must be kept lit. (Changed from [...the stone lantern in the garden is to always be lit.] in the original release)Phoenix: (Hmm... I did wonder what that stone lantern was there for...)Judge: Well if that's true... ...shouldn't the witness have been able to see the crime more clearly?Godot: ...Normally yes, Your Honor. But according to the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...on the night of the crime, it was impossible to light that stone lantern.Phoenix: Impossible...?Godot: It hadn't been used in a long time and the wick was no good. In other words... It had to be nearly pitch black in the garden that night. There could have been a faint light coming from the Training Hall, but that's all.Judge: Most enlightening...Godot: Yes, that illuminating fact has chased all the contradictions away! ...If the staff was dropped, it would be difficult to see. It also explains why they didn't recognize each other. We can't see the demons that lurk in the night... That's why humans are weak. Isn't that right, Trite?Phoenix: N-- Nooooooooooooooo!Judge: Order! Order! Ordeeer!Godot: Here, Your Honor. Let me present the stone lantern into evidence. Maybe it will rekindle the flame of truth in your mind.Stone Lantern added to the Court Record.Judge: ............Phoenix: (Why is the judge just sitting there with that look on his face...?)Godot: ...What's wrong, Your Honor? Was that flame too hot?Judge: Th-This lantern... There's something written on it!Godot: ...?Judge: Wh-Why... It's written in blood!Phoenix: (Oooh boy...! So the judge didn't know about that yet...)Godot: Written... in blood?Iris: ...Judge: It... It says...! It says, \"Maya\" upside-down!Godot: Wh-What the...!?Iris: Oh yes... That's right... After being cornered and then stabbed by Mystic Maya... Mystic Elise didn't fall down right away. She must have been writing that on the stone lantern behind her... ...with the blood that was draining out of her body!Judge: Hmm... It certainly looks that way...Godot:Godot: Hang on... Hang on just a minute! What are you all talking about!?Judge: What do you mean, \"What are we all talking about?\"Phoenix: We're talking about the message written in blood...Godot: Hmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!Phoenix: (C-Could it be...? He can't see the bloody writing at all...!? Now that I think of it, he did say something to me yesterday...)Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.Phoenix: (So that's what he meant by that...)Judge: ...In any case, this is obviously an important clue. We now know that the crime scene was dark... ...and that the victim scrawled this message on the stone lantern! Well, Mr. Godot? Anything further?Godot: ...Judge: M-Mr. Godot?Godot: ...! Errr, umm... OK then... Let's move on.Phoenix: (Godot is literally shaking, and somehow, I don't think it's from caffeine overdose.)Judge: ...I believe it has now been established... ...that Ms. Deauxnim was killed by Maya Fey.Phoenix: (Th-That's... just wrong!)Godot: ...Now it's time to turn our attention to you.Iris: ...Yes, sir.Godot: After the victim died, you did something, didn't you? Let's hear it. ...We're all ears.Witness Testimony-- Sister Iris's Cover-Up --Iris: After Mystic Elise died... I called out to Mystic Maya. I thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition. So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself... I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge. Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and... ...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.Judge: ...So you moved the body.Iris: Yes... I was raised at Hazakura Temple... I owe a great deal of thanks to the Fey clan. But even so... I never imagined... ...that Elise Deauxnim was actually Misty Fey! I've... I've committed a terrible sin!Judge: Hmm... A terrible trick of fate.Phoenix: (I believe you're looking for \"twist of fate\", Your Honor.)Iris: I intended to return to the Inner Temple after taking care of the body... But...Godot: You were spotted by the head nun, correct?Iris: Yes... And that's why I couldn't go back.Judge: ...Your story makes sense, I suppose. Mr. Wright, go ahead with your cross-examination.Phoenix: ...Yes, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Sister Iris's Cover-Up --Iris: After Mystic Elise died... I called out to Mystic Maya.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you waited until everything was over before making a move? Iris: N-No, it's not like that... Godot: Godot: She saw someone murdered right in front of her eyes... It's not surprising that she was a little timid... Judge: ...Yes, I suppose that's true. Sometimes when I'm watching lawyers argue back and forth with each other... ...I feel so helpless that I just sit quietly and wait for them to reach a conclusion. Phoenix: (...Isn't it your job as the judge to mediate the argument!?) Iris: It wasn't until Mystic Maya saw me... ...that it finally dawned on her what she had done.Iris: I thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So then... You knew...? You knew the significance of the name \"Maya Fey\"...? Iris: Y-Yes... Of course I did. Phoenix: (That's odd... I mean, Sister Bikini didn't recognize Maya's name, let alone her position...) Iris: Anyway... She was a very special person indeed.Iris: So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you do that? Iris: Because I didn't want Mystic Maya to be suspected in any way. I thought the best thing would be to remove the body from the crime scene... Judge: You moved her body all by yourself...? Iris: ...Yes. I did. It would have been impossible if it wasn't for the snow... Phoenix: (The snow, huh...?)Iris: I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It's pretty amazing you could make it all the way across... That's a rickety old bridge. Iris: It looks worse than it is. It's surprisingly sturdy despite its age. Godot: It's like they say, \"Idiots are too stupid to catch even a simple cold.\" Phoenix: ...But there's one other thing that bothers me. Why not just throw the body into the Eagle River? Iris: ... Phoenix: It would have been much easier than dragging it all the way to Hazakura Temple. Iris: I thought that it would still cast too much suspicion on Mystic Maya... That's why I tried to take the body as far away as possible... Godot: Ha...! Makes perfect sense to me! ...For the time being. Anyway... What did you do after you crossed the bridge?Present Weather Data (after adding statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"...You claim that the snow had already stopped when the murder occurred.\"Iris: Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The snowmobile? (I knew that would show up sooner or later...) Iris: ...Yes, I had the key. I used the snowmobile to travel from Hazakura Temple to Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: (This is the part that was in question the other day. Should I ask for more details...?) Forget it Phoenix: (...Forget it, there's plenty of other things to go after in this testimony. Iris had the key to the snowmobile. There's nothing strange about that...) Judge: Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard? Iris: Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I... Leads back to cross-examination About the snowmobile Phoenix: Let me hear more about this snowmobile ride. Iris: Well, it was very cold that night... So I rode it all the way to the foot of the bridge. Godot: Godot: I'm sorry, witness... But now, I've got a problem with your testimony. Iris: Excuse me? Phoenix: (Godot... What are you up to now?) Godot: That night... After the head nun left the remainder of the training to you... ...she said she walked from the Inner Temple back to Hazakura Temple. Judge: Yes... I'm fairly certain that's what the record indicates. Godot: Let's recall her comments on the subject... Bikini: Maybe... But, when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. Godot: ...The snowmobile was in front of the Main Gate. This is one of those contradictions, wouldn't you say? Iris: ...! Judge: Or-Order! ...Mr. Godot! Wh-Why are you pointing out contradictions in the witness's testimony!? Godot: ...Let's just say I like things to be neat and tidy, OK? Iris: Umm... Well... Maybe... S-Sister Bikini missed it. Yes, maybe she didn't see it. Phoenix: You think she missed it...? (That doesn't sound right...) Godot: Ha...! Whatever. Even I don't think this is decisive enough to warrant any more time or effort. It's just... You'd better be careful in your testimony. That's all I wanted to say. A smart little cookie like you shouldn't have any trouble understanding that. Iris: Y-Yes, sir. Phoenix: (What was that all about...? Why would Godot want to give me a hint...!?) Judge: Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard? Iris: Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I... Leads back to cross-examination About the tracks (before adding statement) Phoenix: If you really did move her body by snowmobile... ...then there should be tracks left in the snow, right? Judge: Well yes, naturally you would expect tracks. Phoenix: This picture was presented at yesterday's trial... ...Are these the tracks from that ride? Iris: Y-Yes... I think they are. Phoenix: But... I can only see one set of tracks here. Iris: ...I don't see what's so strange about that. Snow was still falling when I left Hazakura Temple. Judge: I see... Snow was still falling, huh? Iris: And then when the murder took place, it had already stopped. That's why there are such fresh-looking tracks. Judge: Hmm... How about it, Mr. Wright? What do you think about this testimony...? It's very important. Phoenix: (When the murder took place, the snow had already stopped...? That doesn't make sense if you stack it up against the other evidence.) ...Your Honor! I'd like the statement Iris just made added to the testimony! Judge: B-But... Does it have something to do with the case? Phoenix: All will be made clear if you allow her statement to be added to the record. Godot: Ha...! This should be fun! You. Let's get this snow business cleared up, shall we? Iris: Y-Yes, sir... Adds statement \"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\" It's not important. Phoenix: (Nothing I've heard sounds strange at all. I'd better not get too worked up about it...) ...I'm fine, Your Honor. I have no problems with her testimony. Judge: Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard? Iris: Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I... Leads back to cross-examination About the tracks (after adding statement) Phoenix: If you really did move her body by snowmobile... ...then there should be tracks left in the snow, right? Judge: Well yes, naturally you would expect tracks. Phoenix: This picture was presented at yesterday's trial... ...Are these the tracks from that ride? Iris: Y-Yes... I think they are. Phoenix: But... I can only see one set of tracks here. Iris: ...I don't see what's so strange about that. Snow was still falling when I left Hazakura Temple. Judge: I see... Snow was still falling, huh? Iris: And then when the murder took place, it had already stopped. That's why there are such fresh-looking tracks. Judge: Hmm... Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard? Iris: Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I... Leads back to cross-examinationIris: ...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is that what you were doing when Sister Bikini saw you? Iris: Y-Yes, th-that's right... She probably thought the worst... Phoenix: (\"Probably\"...? More like \"definitely\".) Judge: Hmm... I see... So Sister Bikini mistakenly thought you were the one that murdered Ms. Deauxnim... Iris: ...I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. It's my fault that this case has gotten so confusing. Judge: Hmmm...Iris: By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There have been a lot of contradictions in your testimony so far. This time... are you sure it's all true? Iris: ...Y-Yes. I am. Phoenix: When the murder happened, the snow had already stopped. According to you, that's why the snowmobile tracks were so clear... Iris: Th-That's right! I'm certain of it! Phoenix: (I think I've trapped her this time.) Godot: ... I see how you think... Snow, huh... Judge: Wh-What is going on here? Phoenix: (If the snow really had stopped by the time of the murder... ...it'd mean there's a bigger hole in her story than that movie The Grid: Revelations!) Godot: Ha...! Well then, Mr. Trite, perhaps you'd like to share your theory with us? Let's see what's up your sleeve... or rather, at the end of your index finger! Iris: ...?Phoenix: (I don't want to believe it, but I don't think my logic is failing me... ...Iris is trying to pin the murder on Maya! But why would she want to do that...? There's only one reason I can think of...)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a lot of information from the game, including characters, evidence, testimonies, and a specific cross-examination scenario. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the given materials.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the testimonies and the evidence provided. The testimony in question is from Iris, specifically the statement: \"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\" This is testimony number 6. \n\nNow, looking at the evidence, the Weather Data (evidence 7) states that the snow stopped around 10:50 PM. However, the murder took place between 10 and 11 PM. If Iris claims the snow had already stopped when the murder occurred, but the Weather Data shows the snow stopped at 10:50, then if the murder happened before 10:50, the snow was still falling. This creates a contradiction because Iris's testimony implies the snow had stopped during the murder, but according to the weather report, it might have still been snowing depending on the exact time.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Iris's testimony (testimony 6) and the Weather Data (evidence 7). The evidence shows the snow stopped later than her claim, making her statement about the snow stopping before the murder potentially false."

    "prompt": "You are provided with a list of characters, evidences and testimonies.\nStory:\n...g myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na\u00efve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris! Iris: ... Phoenix: (Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?) To be continued. February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Edgeworth: Wright, is this what Godot was talking about? Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask\u2606DeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: \u266aNo motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!\u266a \u266a...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...\u266a Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! \u266aGood cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...\u266a Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting\u00a0??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you. (I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant secret left to unlock... Pearls's Psyche-Lock...) [sic] Revenge (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time.

I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: I think it's time you told the truth about what you were doing on that night. Iris: ... Phoenix: You said you were in your room at Hazakura Temple the entire time. Do you still claim that to be the truth? Iris: Yes... That's where I was. Phoenix: Iris... I believe you're innocent. That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder! Present Bikini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Iris!? I trust you, so you need to trust me. Iris: But, Mr. Wright... I can't. Phoenix: Why not? Iris: I can't trust such random nonsense! It doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I screwed up there...) Leads back to: \"Iris... I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... But mistakes just don't suit you. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: I had hoped you would get at least this much correct. I hate seeing you mess up and getting all disappointed. Phoenix: (Nngh... I didn't know she could be so harsh...) Phoenix: Iris, what are you trying to hide...? Iris: ...! Phoenix: The more you lie about it, the more I know it's got to be something really important. Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with?

It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" There were two of you. Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?) Butz: It must've been pretty scary for you, Pearl. I know what it's like. Nick used to leave me behind when I fell asleep at school, too. Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure. I couldn't even grant my mother's final wish... Phoenix: Her \"final wish\"...? Pearl: Yes. This letter. \"This is my last wish,\" she said. \"So make sure you follow the instructions carefully.\" Phoenix: (Hmm... This letter... I definitely need to find out more about it.)

And last month, she told me... Morgan: The time we've been waiting for has come, Pearl. There's something I need you to do for me. I hid a letter for you at our home before they brought me here. I want you to read it, and do exactly what it says. It's for the good of the Fey clan, my angel. You'll be doing a great thing. Now, listen carefully, and I'll tell you where the letter's hidden... Pearl: My mother is always nice to me... I love her very much! Butz: Yeah. Moms will do anything for their kids, right? Pearl: She said it was for the good of the Fey clan, so I knew I had to help her. I mean, Mystic Maya's part of the Fey clan, so it had to be good for her, too. That's right, isn't it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Usually, a picture is enough to channel someone's spirit, but this time... Butz: ...Pretty weird, huh? Phoenix: (Like Larry knows anything about this stuff!)

Pearl: Yes! I was so happy when she invited me! But... I didn't go in the end. Phoenix: You didn't go...? Pearl: ... No. There was somewhere else I had to go instead. I was so worried, I... I had to go. I didn't know what to do with myself. I was so nervous. Phoenix: (So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...

Phoenix: If I'm right, will you tell me the whole truth? Pearl: ... O-OK... Phoenix: You went to this place for one very simple reason, and that is this: Present Maya Fey profile (after presenting Inner Temple) Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls.\" Otherwise Phoenix: Phoenix: Well Pearls? This is what you were worrying about, right? Pearl: ... There's something I'm worrying about right now, actually. Phoenix: What's that? Pearl: You, Mr. Nick. Your face has turned a really strange color. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You shouldn't work so hard, you know. You need to take a break once in a while. Phoenix: (...Being chided by a 9 year old. How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this! (I guess I'm going to have to think this through one more time from the very beginning.) Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Phoenix: You knew the training Maya was undertaking was dangerous. After all, it was the Special Course. Pearl: ... Maya: I signed up for your \"Special Course\"! Bikini: Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why. The reason you were so worried about that bell was because of this: Present Burnt Letter Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... You know, Mr. Nick, I think you should take a break now. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: Even your hair's starting to look a bit tired. The spikes aren't looking so sharp. Phoenix: (Looks like picking this piece of evidence wasn't so sharp of me, either.) ...A-Anyway! You said you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell... Leads back to: \"Huh!? Oh! I...\" Phoenix: You were given some instructions to follow for that night, weren't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: I presume you recognize these pieces of paper? Pearl: Aaaaah! Wh-Where did you...? Phoenix: In the incinerator at the Inner Temple. Pearls... You were following the instructions in this letter that night, weren't you? That's why you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the lights out bell. Pearl: I... I'm speechless, Mr. Nick! You're amazing! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: These instructions that were found in the incinerator... I believe they were written for you, Pearls. Pearl: For me!? I... No...

Phoenix: Who was it, Pearls? Whose spirit were you supposed to be channeling? Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: (Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it... ...whose spirit would Pearls have been trying to channel? Don't over-think it, Phoenix! It's pretty obvious who Pearls was supposed to channel...) The person you were trying to channel that night, Pearls, was... Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Pearls? Am I right? Pearl: I... I can't channel anyone anymore. Pearl: A spirit medium who can't channel spirits... is like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: (Poor kid. It's really getting her down.) Pearl: But... I have never channeled that person's spirit! Phoenix: (I should have all the evidence I need, so what am I not getting here...?) Leads back to: \"Taking into account the author of the note, and their purpose for writing it...\" Phoenix: It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter.

Do you know what kind of a woman Dahlia Hawthorne was? Pearl: Umm... no. I've never heard of anyone by that name before reading those instructions... Phoenix: (I thought so. Pearls doesn't have a clue. She doesn't know that Dahlia is her sister...) About the instructions in the letter I found, Pearls... Who wrote them? Pearl: Umm... Phoenix: Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of... You must have quite a lot of respect for them. Pearl: ...

Present Morgan Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Pearls... I have to wonder about something...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the person who wrote the instructions, isn't it Pearls? You must have had a lot of faith in them to follow their instructions to a tee! Pearl: ... I... I had a lot of faith... in you, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Oh! Thanks! Pearl: But... ...I don't think I can trust you anymore. Phoenix: (Ouch... Pearls sure can be blunt when she wants to be... Alright now, think! Someone who Pearls would trust, no questions asked... There can't be many candidates for that post.) Leads back to: \"Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of...\" Phoenix: Pearls... I have to wonder about something... You didn't have any idea what these instructions meant, did you? Pearl: ...*ba-dump* Phoenix: But you followed them to the letter regardless. Why? Because it was your own mother who asked you. That's why. Pearl: H-How did you...? Phoenix: I figured it out. The person who wrote you this letter was your own mother, Morgan Fey! Pearl: Uh... Waaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Alright, Pearls! It's time you started telling me the truth. Pearl: M-M-Mr. N-Nick... I-I-I... Phoenix: (Why's she holding back from me? I don't like this...)

Pearl: Because... I... I d-don't think y-y-you have a-a-any! Phoenix: Nnnnnngh... (She'd say anything rather than admit to carrying out those instructions... I guess I'll have to produce some more evidence, then. One more thing should do it.) ...Alright, Pearls. We both know someone carried out these instructions on the night of the murder. But you're right. There's no evidence that proves it was you. Pearl: I-I-I knew it! Phoenix: However... I do know that whoever did it was a child. Pearl: Huh? H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: It couldn't have been an adult... No adult would've made a simple mistake like that. Pearl: A... simple mistake? What do you mean by that? Phoenix: I'm sure you thought you were carefully following the instructions you'd been given. But you misunderstood some of the words, and this is the evidence that proves it! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This shows the mistake you made! Pearl: ... Umm... I guess you know what I'm about to say, huh? I don't think it's me who made a mistake, Mr. Nick. It's you. Phoenix: (But the person who read these instructions must have been a child. That's why they misunderstood the meaning of that word... It's the only explanation for how such a simple mistake could've been made!) OK, Pearls. I'll go over it again. The person who read these instructions... Leads back to: \"It couldn't have been an adult...\" Phoenix: It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah! Wh-What!? Wh-Why would I d-do something like...? Phoenix: Do you remember what was written in that letter? \"Gravely roast the Master in the fires of Hades and bring our vengeance to fruition.\" But you didn't know how to read the words \"gravely\" and \"roast\" among others, right? Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea... Phoenix: Just a tiny bit. Pearl: I... I really am useless! I couldn't even burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me...

You can't punish the dead... and you can't take revenge against them either.Judge: Y-You wanted to take revenge on someone?Dahlia: I was sentenced to die because of that woman... Mia Fey.Phoenix: (I somehow knew this was it...)Dahlia: ...I wanted to send her a message. It was at her hands that I suffered my first humiliation... I wanted her to feel the same pain she made me feel! Sadly... when I realized revenge was impossible, I gave up.Godot: And the reason it was impossible...? Was it perhaps because Mia Fey had already died...?Dahlia: Yes. And I realized... there's only one way to take revenge against the dead.Judge: A-And how do you do that?Dahlia: Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever. I wanted to take away the person that Mia Fey loved most. I wanted to kill her with my own hands! That would be the one and only way I could take my revenge against Mia Fey! That was the reason I helped out with that woman's plans!Phoenix: Just for that!? For that you would kill Maya!? Your goal was no different than that of Morgan Fey!Judge: ... As they say, \"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\" What a cruel plan... Cruel, cold, and heartless.Dahlia: ...Hmph! Don't waste your time preaching to the dead. I've already told you, there's not a thing you can do to me.Phoenix: Grrrr...!Dahlia: That night... ...at about 9:30 PM, I materialized into this world. I quickly pinned my hair up and put on a demon-warding hood. Then I picked up the staff that was by my side and left Hazakura Temple.Phoenix: (So... it was Elise Deauxnim who channeled her after all.)Dahlia: ...That ridiculous head nun never noticed a thing. She left Maya Fey at the Inner Temple... ...and wobbled back clutching her poor old back.Judge: Wh-What did you do then...?Dahlia: That kid was easier to handle than I had hoped... I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and...Phoenix: S-So then you... Y-You're saying you s-stabbed Maya!Dahlia: ............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that.Judge: ...What does that mean!? No clear memory...?Dahlia: I don't know... I think... I think I was stabbed.Phoenix: You were stabbed!?Dahlia: At the last minute, Maya Fey must have stabbed me. I'm sure of it.Phoenix:Phoenix: That's not like her at all! Maya wouldn't stab a French fry with a plastic fork!Dahlia: Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. Just as I was passing out, I wrote \"Maya\" behind my back. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on her.Phoenix: (I-I can't believe she was thinking of that until the bitter end...)Dahlia: ...That's where my memory temporarily stops.Judge: It-It stops...?Dahlia: I don't have any memory of actually killing Maya Fey with my own two hands. My very last memory was... ...Maya's terror-filled eyes. When I woke up after that... ...I was in the Sacred Cavern surrounded by darkness.Judge: You were in the Sacred Cavern?Dahlia: ...The entrance was sealed with one of those trick locks. Somehow I had been trapped in there.Godot: But how did you wind up in there?Dahlia: ...I'd like to know that myself. Anyway, I was worried... I didn't know whether or not Maya Fey was dead... And I swore I wouldn't return to the underworld until I knew I had killed her myself.Godot: Hmm... For a ghost, you're one tough cookie...Dahlia: I wanted to get out of there and make sure she was dead. But... I couldn't do it. I couldn't get out.Godot: The trick lock stopped you, huh?Dahlia: I didn't know how to remove it.Judge: So then you're saying... ...you were actually confined against your will inside this Sacred Cavern...?Dahlia: Yes! I wanted to get rid of that annoying lock as soon as possible... But it wasn't easy. I kept getting interrupted while I was working on it.Phoenix: Interrupted...?Dahlia: It was early in the morning, but someone came into the Training Hall.Judge: What!? Who!?Phoenix: Could it have been... Maya!?Dahlia: I thought the same thing. But I couldn't see.Phoenix: Why not!?Dahlia: If someone had spotted me, I would have lost my chance to take revenge. ...So I made sure to hide myself well at the back of the Sacred Cavern.Phoenix: (That morning... only two people could have gone into the Training Hall. Maya and... Pearls... Pearls went there to cover the hanging scroll in gravy.)Dahlia: Still, I finally managed to remove the lock. But... I was too late.Godot: What do you mean by that?Dahlia: ...The flies had already started to gather.Godot: The bridge had been fixed and the police had started their investigation, correct?Dahlia: Naturally, I couldn't go out. So instead... I returned to the cavern and put the lock back on myself. I realized I wouldn't get a chance to see Maya's corpse as I had hoped... But just then... Lady Luck showed up.Phoenix: Lady Luck...?Dahlia: After that big earthquake... she showed up, all by herself.Phoenix: ...The real Iris?Dahlia: She said she'd come to make sure the Sacred Cavern was alright... Stupid girl. I came out from the Sacred Cavern and got a feel for the situation. ...And I locked her away in my place. I had finally learned exactly what had happened... It was then that I learned that the plan had actually succeeded.Phoenix: What do you mean your plan had succeeded?Dahlia: I had misunderstood one thing, you see. That night, the one that had summoned me... I had assumed that it was Pearl Fey.Judge: W-Well of course you would've assumed that. It was written in the instructions.Dahlia: But... I was wrong. The person that had actually called my spirit back was... Misty Fey... The picture book author...Judge: Wh... Whaaaaaaat!?Dahlia: Well, that's really the only possibility, isn't it? After I lost consciousness in the garden... ...it was her body that was left lying there... Maya Fey... I wasn't able to kill her with my own hands after all. But even so... I made her commit the most vile sin a human can commit.Judge: And that is...?Dahlia: Matricide. The sin of killing her own mother!Phoenix: Ugggh... NOOOO WAY!!Judge: Or-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of this!?Dahlia: It's true that I was the one who attacked Maya Fey... But even so... ...the murderer who actually snuffed out Misty Fey's life was none other than... ...your darling little Maya!Phoenix:Phoenix: R-Ridiculous! That's nonsense...Dahlia: Are you sure about that? ...Just think about it. There's even evidence supporting these facts, isn't there?Phoenix: What...!? What do you mean? Wh-What is this so-called evidence!?Dahlia: ...The fact that Maya Fey has disappeared is evidence enough, isn't it?Phoenix: Huh...?Dahlia: The idea that she's still in the Sacred Cavern is just ridiculous. She wasn't able to escape from the Inner Temple, that much is obvious. In that case, there is only one place she could be.Judge: Wh-Where...?Dahlia: Do I have to spell it out? ...The bottom of the Eagle River, where else?Godot: Ea-Eagle River...!?Dahlia: Maya Fey killed her long-lost mother. Can you imagine the guilt she must have felt when she realized that? That's why she threw herself into the Eagle River. Most bodies that wind up in there are lost forever. So, what do you have to say now... Feenie?Phoenix: Ooooh... Uuuuuhhhh...Phone: .........Godot: ...Oops. Sorry, that's my phone.Phoenix: (What kind of ringtone is that...?)Phone:...*beep*...Godot: ...Godot here. ......... ...OK. Thanks.Phone:...*beep*...Judge: W-Was it something important?Godot: They just finished removing the locks from the Sacred Cavern.Phoenix: That's great! What about Maya?Godot: ... There was a woman in the cave...Judge: Was it Maya Fey...?Godot: It was the accused... Sister Iris.Phoenix: Huh...?Dahlia: Don't look so surprised. ...I locked her in there yesterday. I just got finished telling you that.Phoenix: So... what about Maya? Where is she?Godot: ... There was no one else found inside the Sacred Cavern.Phoenix: N-No... It can't be...Dahlia: I told you, didn't I? She's dead.Phoenix: No... Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge: It seems... ...that this case has come to an end... A tragic end... Sadly, it appears the killer of Elise Deauxnim, also known as Misty Fey... ...was her own daughter, Maya Fey. Overcome with guilt for what she had done... ...Maya Fey jumped to her death into the raging waters of the Eagle River!Phoenix: (It can't be...)...Ha!...Godot: Trite... Have you ever heard this one? \"Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth.\" ...No matter how improbable it may seem.Judge: Wh... What is that supposed to mean, Prosecutor Godot...?Godot: According to this witness... ...Maya Fey threw herself into the Eagle River. However... is that really the truth?Phoenix: ...!Godot: Remember, this woman testified earlier that... ...the bridge was already on fire when the murder was taking place in the garden. Which means if Maya had thrown herself into the river... ...it must have been from the Inner Temple side, near the bridge.Dahlia: That's right! That's where she jumped from...Godot: But that's impossible. It's impossible to jump into the river from there!Phoenix: ...! (Wh-What...!?)Godot: Don't get your panties all twisted up, Trite. Just relax and think through the whole thing again.Phoenix: (So it's impossible...? Maya couldn't have thrown herself into Eagle River...?)Judge: ...Well, Mr. Wright? Ms. Hawthorne claims Ms. Fey threw herself into the river from the Inner Temple side. Do you have any evidence that refutes this claim?Present Hazakura Temple Map or Dusky Bridge Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's impossible to jump into the Eagle River from the Inner Temple side...\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: ...That's it? That's your answer? Godot: Ha...! The only one that should be thrown into a river is you. Phoenix: Ugh...! Godot: But then again... Even if you did... ...you wouldn't reach the river, would you? Phoenix: (Huh...? What's that...? I wouldn't reach it...?) Leads back to: \"Don't get your panties all twisted up, Trite.\"Phoenix: It's impossible to jump into the Eagle River from the Inner Temple side... No one knows that better than this witness!Dahlia: What did you say...?Phoenix: Eleven years ago, you jumped into the very same river!Dahlia: ...!Phoenix: Just take a look at this overhead map! As you can see... ...below the cliff on the Inner Temple side is a big rock shelf!Judge: Oh... Ooooh! Y-You're right!Phoenix: She wouldn't have reached the river if she had jumped off from there. In other words... If she had jumped, we should be able to see her body in this photo!Dahlia: Ah!Godot: Ha...! So you finally figured it out!Dahlia: You...! Nooooooooo!Judge: O-Order! Order!!Dahlia: You... You're just playing with me! Maya Fey's body is at the bottom of the Eagle River! There's nowhere else she could possibly be hiding!Phoenix: Ms. Hawthorne... Have you ever heard this one before? \"Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth.\"Dahlia: Yes, just a few minutes ago.Phoenix: ...Maya Fey wasn't inside the Sacred Cavern. We now know that she didn't throw herself into the Eagle River.Godot: ...Correct. That eliminates all the most likely possibilities.Phoenix: Now, although it seems improbable, there's still one other place she could be.Judge: Wh... What...!? What is this one possibility you are talking about...?Dahlia: Th-That's obviously a bluff! So where is her dead body then?Phoenix: (Finally... I think the pieces are falling into place... Normally the living have no way to punish the dead... But I think there is a way to give Dahlia Hawthorne the ultimate punishment.) ...Shall I tell you, Ms. Hawthorne? Shall I tell you where Maya is this very instant!? Maya Fey is...in the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The Inner Temple was cut off from the outside world on the night of the crime. So in other words, Maya is still there! Judge: ... Mr. Wright, let me ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds. The police scoured the Inner Temple from top to bottom, correct? Godot: You bet. Detective Gumshoe had his nose to the ground and sniffed around everywhere. Judge: Then the fact that Maya is not in the Inner Temple... ...has already been adequately proven, has it not!? Phoenix: Y-Yikes...! Guess my intuition was wrong. Godot: Intuition...? Truthiness has no place here! Use your brain, not your gut, to find the real truth, Trite! Leads back to: \"Th-That's obviously a bluff!\"in Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: It's already been proven that she isn't on the Inner Temple side! So that means... she must be somewhere in Hazakura Temple! Judge: ... Mr. Wright, let me ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds. The bridge was already on fire when the murder took place, correct? Godot: Just so you know, my heart is also on fire and it aches from your stupidity. Judge: So the impossibility of Maya Fey escaping from the Inner Temple side... ...has already been adequately proven, has it not!? Phoenix: Y-Yikes...! Guess my intuition was wrong. Godot: Intuition...? Truthiness has no place here! Use your brain, not your gut, to find the real truth, Trite! Leads back to: \"Th-That's obviously a bluff!\"in this very courtroom. Leads to: \"There's only one possibility left.\"Phoenix: There's only one possibility left. Namely... she's right here in this very courtroom!Dahlia: Wh-What!?Godot: M-Maya Fey is here!?Judge: You say she's here in m-my courtroom!?Phoenix: ...Dahlia Hawthorne. I seem to recall that you said... \"I had misunderstood one thing, you see.\"Dahlia: So what!?Phoenix: But I think there's one more thing you misunderstood.Dahlia: What do you mean...?Phoenix: Tell me something. At this very moment... ...who is channeling Dahlia Hawthorne!?Dahlia: Wh-Why that... that's obvious! It's Pearl Fey! That pathetic, little, sniveling runt!Phoenix: ...You're wrong. Pearls tried... but she couldn't do it.Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened.Phoenix: Isn't there any explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit?Pearl: ... It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit.Dahlia: Someone called me before Pearl did...? But who...?Phoenix: Pearls even tried again on the day after the crime. But she couldn't do it... What could that mean? I think the truth is becoming clearer to you right about now, am I correct?Dahlia: ... Aaaah!Phoenix: It wasn't Pearls that channeled you! There was someone who called you before she could!Present Maya Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...This is an easy one.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (No, that's not who! How can I come this far and still not get it!? Pearls couldn't channel her. And Maya had disappeared... There's only one possible answer!) Judge: Mr. Wright! You can mumble to yourself like a wino on your own time! Phoenix: P-Please... Give me just one more chance... Leads back to: \"It wasn't Pearls that channeled you!\"Phoenix: ...This is an easy one. Pearls couldn't do it, and Misty Fey is gone. There's only one possibility left!Judge: Come on already...! I can't stand the tension!Phoenix: Dahlia Hawthorne! The person channeling you right now must be... Maya Fey!Dahlia: Wh... WHAAAAAAAT!?Judge: B-But how could that be!? Remember what this witness, Dahlia Hawthorne, said about her goal!Godot: She said that her goal was to kill Maya Fey.Judge: Yes, that's right. But if Maya channeled the spirit of someone that was trying to kill her...! ...Godot: Ha...! Well, gramps? What would happen?Judge: ... C-Could it be...?Phoenix: It looks like you finally understand, Your Honor.Dahlia: W-Well, I don't! What are you going on about!?Phoenix: What I'm going on about is the reason Maya channeled you... And there's only one reason. To protect herself from you!Dahlia: To... protect herself... ...from me?Phoenix: Yes. On the night of the crime, you were only interested in one thing.Killing Maya Fey!Phoenix: The path back to Hazakura was closed off and there was nowhere for her to run. (Changed from [The path to the Inner Temple was closed off and there was nowhere for her to run.] in the original release) So then the problem became... \"Where would be the safest place to hide?\"Dahlia: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You mean... That's when she channeled me...?Phoenix: All this time, you thought you had been channeled by Pearls... (Changed from [All along you thought you had been channeled by Pearls...] in the original release) That's why it never occurred to you... ...that Maya's hiding place... ...was you!Dahlia: N-No... No... DON'T SAY THAT! Y-You're saying that I... Dahlia Hawthorne... (Changed from [Y-You're saying that I...] in the original release) ...was played for a fool!? By that little whelp!?Phoenix: ...Dahlia: Maya Fey killed herself! Isn't it obvious!?Phoenix:Phoenix: Sorry, but no... It would have been impossible for her to jump into the Eagle River. ...This was the only avenue of escape open to Maya. The only way that Maya could disappear from the Inner Temple...!Dahlia: I-I don't believe you...! A stupid little girl like that who has never been out in the real world... She could never have come up with a plan like that! Who could have ever given her such a brilliant idea!?Phoenix: ... Well......Me, of course...Phoenix: M... Mia!Dahlia: Mia Fey!Mia: It's been a long time, Dahlia Hawthorne...Godot: ... ...So it's true... It was you.Mia: ...Yes.Godot: Ha...! You're something else...Dahlia: B-But what... what are you doing here...!?Phoenix: That hair... It's Pearls, right?Mia: Tell me something, Dahlia... I want you to think back to that night one more time. You had just cornered Maya in the Inner Temple's garden. And then... in the final moments of the fight, you lost consciousness.Dahlia: I was stabbed! By Maya Fey!Mia: Actually... Maya lost consciousness at the same time as you.Godot: ...She did?Judge: Not terribly surprising since she was about to be killed.Mia: ...When she woke up, she was in the Training Hall. That's when Maya decided she needed help... So she channeled me. She explained in a memo the situation she was in. She asked me what I thought she should do.Dahlia: She did that...? I can't believe it...Mia: Of course, I didn't have all the details. But... One thing was perfectly clear.Judge: And that was...?Mia: I knew that you couldn't be allowed to wander free.Phoenix: Free...? What do you mean?Mia: It was a race against time, so I wrote down two things that Maya had to do. Channel Dahlia Hawthorne as soon as possible... ...and lock herself in the Sacred Cavern until help arrived.Phoenix: (So it was Maya who put that lock on there...)Judge: Yes, but why did you order her to do those two things?Mia: If she hadn't done it... ...Dahlia Hawthorne would've been channeled by someone else. By one Pearl Fey.Phoenix: P-Pearls?Mia: Yes. Pearl didn't properly understand the plan. So all she was trying to do was follow her mother, Morgan Fey's instructions. If she had succeeded in channeling Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit... ...things would have turned out very badly, to put it mildly.Godot: ......... ...So that's how it was. Dahlia Hawthorne would have used the body of Pearl Fey... ...to kill Maya at all costs.Judge: Y-Yes, it certainly sounds like that was the intent all along.Dahlia: H-How dare you!? I-I won't forget this...!Phoenix: Why not just admit it? ...Dahlia Hawthorne. Your little plan was nothing but a big failure.Mia: Yes... Another failure to add to the pile of shame, wouldn't you say?Dahlia: Wh-What do you mean by another!?Phoenix: Think about it, Dahlia. Remember all your past crimes? Not a single one of them was a success. They all ended in failure.Dahlia: What...!? How dare you...!Phoenix: 11 years ago... The fake kidnapping... Your very first crime. You got your hands on a 2 million dollar diamond. But... ...after Terry Fawles escaped and went to meet with Valerie Hawthorne... ...the truth was exposed.Dahlia: Sh-Shut your mouth! That wasn't my fault! It was because of that stupid oaf of a prisoner and that weakling of a policewoman!Phoenix: And then... one year later. You tried to kill me.Dahlia: ...!Phoenix: Well... I'm still alive, but... ...you wound up killing someone else. As a result, you were sentenced to death. ...It's one stupid move after another for you. But it's no longer funny.Dahlia: You...! Wipe that smug, happy-go-lucky smile off your face...!Phoenix: And now this! You've messed up again! You let Maya Fey escape. Even though she was right there in front of you!Dahlia: ...Grr...Mmm...Nnnn... Grrr... Ahh! M... M... Mia F... F... Fey Mia Fey! Mia Fey! MIA FEEEEY! You... You... spinster!! I was supposed to kill Maya Fey like I swore I would! And if only you had gotten this spiky-haired jerk the guilty verdict... ...I wouldn't have been hanged to death!Mia: ...... True.Dahlia: ...!Mia: But I think you finally understand, Dahlia Hawthorne. ...You will never defeat me.Dahlia: Wh-What...!? What did you say!?Mia: Whether you're alive, dead, or somewhere in between, you will never defeat me. As long as I'm around, you're destined to lose for all of eternity!Dahlia: Grrr... Grrrr... Grrrrr...Phoenix: ...I remember what you said earlier in the trial. You said there was no way we could punish you... ...because you were already dead.Dahlia: What about it!?Phoenix: Then you said... \"Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever.\"Mia: ...That's very true, Dahlia. And that's exactly the punishment you'll never be able to escape from.Dahlia: ...!Mia: For all of eternity, you'll have to remain as Dahlia Hawthorne. A miserable, pathetic, weak creature who can never win at anything... And for you, there is no escape from that. No hope of freedom. Since the day you were executed... ...the narrow bridge that once stretched out in front of you has burnt to a crisp!Dahlia: ...Y-You... OoOooOOh... ...Y-You'RE... wROnG... ...It... CAN'T... be... ...How... coULd... I... ...loSe... to... THe... ...likES... of... YOU...?Phoenix: It no longer matters! I don't care whether you win or lose anymore. The only thing I want... ...is for you to come out of Maya's body right now!Dahlia: ...... ...... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ...I'M... NOT... READY... ...NOT... READY... TO... GO...Maya: ...Nick... ...Sis...Judge: Now then... I assume you are the real Iris...?Iris: ...Yes. I was just rescued from the Sacred Cavern.Judge: I must say you and your twin sister are indeed identical from what I can see. In any case... It appears that everything has finally been cleared up. Mr. Godot. ...What happened to Dahlia Hawthorne?Godot: If you ask me, Your Honor... ...it looks like she went back to the hell she came from.Judge: Hmm... It seems that Misty Fey wasn't the only victim of this crime. Maya Fey, as well as the young Pearl Fey... ...were also victims of this wicked and selfish plan.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.Judge: The tragedy of \"Medium Valley\" has finally come to an end, it seems. It would be best for everyone if no further attempt was made to channel that spirit again.Phoenix: ............ Umm... Your Honor?Judge: Yes, what is it?Phoenix: About this whole \"spirit medium\" thing... It's almost weird how comfortable you seem to be with the concept now.Judge: ... Well, to be frank, my younger brother is quite judgmental... He often criticizes me for not studying hard enough. That's why I made a concerted effort to study up on the Kurain Channeling Technique.Phoenix: (Hey! Isn't that the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\"!?)Judge: ...I've seen quite a few things in my many years on the bench. And in all that time, I've finally learned this one thing. Each case is different, and takes place in its own world, if you will. In order to fully understand that world... ...first we have to immerse ourselves in it completely. And that's where... my brother and I used to differ.Phoenix: (Hmm, never thought of it that way...)Judge: ...At any rate! It's time to pass judgment in the case of Iris of Hazakura Temple.Godot:Godot: ...You're a little too fast with that gavel, Your Honor.Judge: What do you mean by that, Mr. Godot!?Mia: This trial... It isn't over yet. ...That's what he means.Phoenix: W-What!?Godot: Trite... Remember what Miss Evil Spirit said in her testimony?Phoenix: Huh? Dahlia's testimony?Dahlia: I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and...Dahlia: ............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that. I think... I think I was stabbed.Mia: ...Just as Dahlia Hawthorne was about to attack Maya... ...she was stabbed and \"killed\" by someone.Judge: Y-Yes... That's right...Godot: The person that was ultimately killed was the spirit medium that channeled Dahlia... ...Elise Deauxnim, no, Misty Fey. But... who killed her? We still don't know who did it!Phoenix: Th-This isn't over!?Godot: Unless someone else is found guilty, the accused is still on trial. We can't let her walk until there is evidence that proves her innocence.Phoenix: N-No way...Judge: But... This court isn't prepared for any further testimony...Godot: The prosecution is ready to call our final witness!Judge: F-Final... witness!?Godot: This one will clear up the whole mystery... The mystery of \"Who killed Misty Fey\"!Judge: ...Hmm, indeed!Mia: ... Is it really alright... Mr. Prosecutor?Godot: ... Of course it's alright... Madame Attorney.Judge: Very well then... Who is this final witness?Godot: Ha...! Isn't it obvious? There's one person who saw the whole event and will put the final dagger in this case.Judge: S-Someone who saw the murder take place...?Godot: ...The very person who saw her mother killed in front of her own eyes.Phoenix: Y-You... You mean Maya!? (Changed from [Y-You mean... Maya!?] in the original release) ...You can't! She can't testify after what she's just been through!Godot: We need to find the truth. The prosecution calls Maya Fey to the witness stand!Judge: ...Very well. But first, we'll take a brief recess. ...We'll have to wait for Ms. Fey to recover before summoning her. Once we receive the doctor's permission, we will proceed with the trial!Godot: ...Hey, Trite. I've got something to say to you, so listen up.Phoenix: ...What is it?Godot: I don't think much of you as a lawyer. It's always the same with you. ...You somehow manage to just squeak by without even a faint understanding of the case. Some beautiful woman always seems to come dashing in at the last minute to save you.Phoenix: Y-You've got some nerve!Godot: ...But that's not going to happen this time. This time... you're going to have to do this by yourself.Phoenix: ...!Judge: That's enough! This court is now in recess!February 10, 2:56 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Iris: I'm truly sorry about everything. You were working so hard to defend me... But I was missing all day, and we didn't even have a chance to talk...Phoenix: (...She's right. When I met \"Iris\" at the Training Hall yesterday... ...they had already switched places... and Iris was inside the Sacred Cavern.)Iris: ...I wanted to at least be in the defendant's box today to root you on.Phoenix: W-Well, it wasn't you fault. You were locked up this whole time... There's something more important than that, though. I have to ask you... Why did you help your sister out as much as you did?Iris: Huh...?Phoenix: If you had tried to get help at the Sacred Cavern yesterday... ...you wouldn't have spent an entire day locked up in there.Iris: ... My sister... I felt sorry for her. She was abandoned by our mother and never got any love from our father either.Phoenix: Yes, but... it was the same for you too, wasn't it?Iris: Yes, but at least I had Sister Bikini, who was like a mother to me. If only Dahlia had come with me to Hazakura Temple... I always... I always loved her... Dahlia was always so smart, so strong... She never complained about a thing. That's why I... That's why I promised her that I would help her.Phoenix: Are you talking about the fake kidnapping case 11 years ago?Iris: ...Yes. I-I wanted to be useful to her in some way... B-But, as usual... I was too cowardly... At the last minute, I ran away. Because of that... Dahlia's stepsister, Valerie, ended up... (Changed from [Dahlia's half-sister, Valerie, ended up...] in the original release)Phoenix: (That was the case that wounded Mia so badly...)Iris: But... things didn't end there, of course. Some people suspected that my sister was involved in the murder.Phoenix: Some people...? You must mean...Iris: Yes, two defense attorneys. (Changed from [Yes, two defense lawyers.] in the original release) Mia Fey... and Diego Armando. After poisoning Mr. Armando, who was getting too close to learning the truth... ...Dahlia even tried to kill the person who had unknowingly hid the poison for her. You.Phoenix: (...That's right...) ...Iris. There's one more thing that I have to ask you.Iris: Yes, what is it?Phoenix: On the night of the murder... ...the person that cleaned up the corpse of the victim, Elise Deauxnim... Was it... Was it really you?Iris: ... Yes... It was me. That night, after I rang the lights out bell... I went back to my room. At around 10:30, I received a call on my cell phone.Phone: ......... ...*beep*...\"There's a problem... Come to the Inner Temple right away.\"Iris: I... I got on the snowmobile and headed for the Inner Temple. But...!Phoenix: The path to the Inner Temple was cut off... Right?Iris: Exactly.Phone: ......... ...*beep*...\"We can't just leave the body here... So you've got to do this exactly as I say, got it? (Changed from [...Alright, let's do this as you said...] in the original release)\"Iris: It was me... I was the one that received her body. The murder weapon had been left in her body so she wouldn't bleed too much. The staff that Mystic Elise always held...Phoenix: I knew it... So the actual murder weapon was the staff.Iris: ...Yes, that's right. I brought the body back to Hazakura Temple on the snowmobile.Phoenix: But why... Why did you alter the body?Iris: ...I didn't want anyone to know that the staff was the murder weapon. I didn't want to leave anything that would lead back to Misty Fey... So I dressed her in a robe and stabbed her with the Shichishito... I wiped the blood off the staff's blade and left it next to her on the ground.Phoenix: ...Iris. Just tell me one last thing. Tell me the name of the person that called your cell phone. The real killer.Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... I can't do it... I can't say who did it.Phoenix: ... I... I see...Victim's Staff updated in the Court Record.Bailiff: ...Defendant!Iris: ...Y-Yes...Bailiff: The judge is calling you! He wants you to see you in his chambers. He has some questions about Dahlia Hawthorne.Iris: ...Alright. ... Well then... I'll see you later... There's something I want to tell you. (Changed from [There's something I want to tell you later.] in the original release)Phoenix: Oh, um... OK... (\"Something she wants to tell me\"? So it's true... Iris cooperated with the real killer... Maybe even from the very beginning!)Mia: ...Phoenix.Phoenix: Mia...! Umm... H-How is Maya doing!?Mia: Physically, I'm not worried. She'll recover completely. But emotionally, she's been hurt very badly by this case.Phoenix: I-I see... ...! You don't mean...! She's learned who Elise Deauxnim really was?Mia: ...Yes. I went to the medical office and talked with her. I told her everything I knew.Phoenix: ...But why?Mia: Maya is stronger than you think... I knew she could take it... All of it.Phoenix: What do you mean by that?Mia: I want you to figure that answer out by yourself. ...The trial is about to restart. The real killer... Do you know who it is yet?Phoenix: (Iris wouldn't tell me who called her. But still... I think that just maybe... I know who it was.) That night, the victim was killed in the garden of the Inner Temple. And the criminal wasn't just there by accident. Which means... ...that the killer knew of Dahlia's plan from the very beginning.Mia: ...And one more thing. The victim was moved to the Hazakura Temple side by pendulum. In other words... the criminal couldn't cross the bridge. That means they were stuck on the Inner Temple side for almost an entire day.Phoenix: (Exactly. So the culprit... (Changed from [Exactly. So the criminal...] in the original release) ...was someone that wasn't in Hazakura Temple the following day...!)Mia: ... That's as much help as I can give you. The rest of the battle is yours to win... or lose.Phoenix: OK, I've got it. ...Thank you, Mia. (Finally... It's almost time to bring this case to an end. What exactly did Maya see anyway...? And who was it that actually killed Misty Fey? Whoever it was, I have to prove it... Me. All by myself.)To be continued.February 10, 3:36 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge: Now then, before we proceed any further... ...I'm going to announce the results of the tests we had performed earlier.Phoenix: Tests...?Judge: Yes, tests. On the bloody dagger that was found stuck in the pine tree.Phoenix: Oh yeah! That! (I totally forgot about it.)Godot: That's the weapon that Maya Fey used when she fought with the victim.Phoenix: So what are the results!? Was it the victim's blood, or...?Judge: Due to time constraints, a full test wasn't possible. However... There's one thing we can say with certainty. The blood that was on this dagger was not the victim's blood! ...That is all. Now then, let's restart this trial.Phoenix: (So it wasn't Misty's blood on the dagger... Then whose was it...?)Dagger updated in the Court Record.Judge: I'm sure both the defense and the prosecution know this, but... ...this trial is rapidly coming to a close. Both sides will need to show some firm evidence with their claims.Phoenix: I understand, Your Honor.Godot: From what I've heard... ...the witness is dangerously weak, physically speaking. So, let's finish this quickly.Phoenix: ...Agreed.Judge: Very well! Please bring in the last witness!Godot: ...Witness, please tell us your name and profession.Maya: Maya Fey. My profession is... Umm... I'm the assistant manager at Wright & Co. Law Offices.Phoenix: (Maya...)Judge: According to the magazine I have here... ...you're a spirit medium of the Kurain Channeling Technique...Maya: ... I... I'm frightened. The Fey clan... I don't want any more to do with it.Phoenix: (Oh, Maya... The pain the Fey bloodline causes must be unbearable...)Judge: ...Very well. Now then, Ms. Fey. When the event occurred... you were in the garden of the Inner Temple. And... You witnessed the moment of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. ...Is this correct?Maya: ... I, umm... I... I didn't see anyth--Godot:Godot: Straighten up this instant, young lady! (Changed from [Straighten up this moment, young lady!] in the original release)Maya: Huh...?Godot: Pick your head up and speak clearly. There's always time for crying later.Maya: B-But I...Godot: Your mother was killed right in front of your eyes! There's nothing you can do to change that fact.Maya: ...!Godot: But there's something you can do... You can finish this. You've been watching the whole thing right? You've seen the witnesses come out and you've seen us squeeze the truth out of them. Now it's your turn. ...Let's hear your testimony. On the night of the crime... what exactly did you see happen!?Judge: Witness. If you please.Maya: ...Yes, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- At the Inner Temple --Maya: I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened. Suddenly, someone struck me over the head... I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern. I think I screamed, \"Help me!\" Then something warm splashed over me... That's when... I lost consciousness.Judge: Hmm... So you were struck on the head... I suppose it must have been this staff.Phoenix: Maya! The person who hit you... It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it!?Maya: I-I'm sorry, Nick. I just... I couldn't see... I don't know who it was...Phoenix: Maya, think hard...Maya: Sorry, Nick, but I really couldn't!Godot: Ha...! Can't say it was an especially good night for young ladies to be walking around alone.Judge: It seems that it will be hard to determine the criminal through testimony alone. Very well then, Mr. Wright. Please begin your cross-examination...Phoenix: ... (Maya... Hang in there... She doesn't look well at all...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- At the Inner Temple --Maya: I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who else was on the Inner Temple side that night? Maya: Well, Sister Bikini of course! But I remember her saying that Iris would be coming later as well. Phoenix: (On the day after the incident, Edgeworth met Bikini at Hazakura Temple. That means she couldn't be the criminal.) So then... did Iris actually come later like she said? Maya: Well, umm... Let me think... Phoenix: (She seems confused. It's probably because she's so tired...) Maya: No... I'm sure I didn't see her. She must have come while I was preparing for the training.Maya: Suddenly, someone struck me over the head...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who did it? Who hit you? Maya: Ah... Well... I didn't see who it was... I was hit from behind. Phoenix: You didn't see the person...? But after that, your attacker was in front of you! How could you not see who it was!? Maya: Oh! L-Let me think for a sec... I'm sorry... I just can't remember. Phoenix: (Maya is really having a hard time... What should I do?) Leave her alone Phoenix: (Considering the conditions at the crime scene... ...it's not surprising she didn't see her attacker.) Godot: Ha...! So it looks like even you've got some compassion. Leads to: \"Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely...\" Press her harder Phoenix: ...Come on, Maya, this isn't making sense. Why didn't you see this person? Maya: Umm, well, let me think... It was... Uh... Oh yeah! That's right! It was dark, that's it! Judge: It was dark...? Maya: It's not good to have too much light around when someone is undergoing spiritual training. Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, there was earlier testimony to that effect as well. So it was dark in the garden on the night of the crime... Phoenix: (Which is why she didn't see her attacker... I thought maybe she was trying to hide something, but I guess not...) Leads to: \"Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely...\" Judge: Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely... Phoenix: ...The spirit that was channeled by Elise Deauxnim... Dahlia Hawthorne! Judge: Hmm... Very well, please continue with your testimony. What happened after you were struck on the head...?Maya: I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened afterwards!? Maya: My attacker was in front of me, blocking off my escape. ...I think. Phoenix: Y-You... think...? Maya: After getting hit like that... I-I was in a state of panic. There were only two things rolling around in my mind at the time. Judge: Well now...! This is beginning to get interesting! Phoenix: So what were the two things rolling around in your mind? Maya: Umm... \"My name is Maya Fey. One plus one equals two\"... Phoenix: ... Maya: You see, for some crazy reason, I was afraid I was going to lose my memory. I know it's odd considering my life was in danger, but that's how it was... Judge: That's not odd at all. Your actions are understandable, given the circumstances. So... What did you do then?Maya: I think I screamed, \"Help me!\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You think you screamed, but you're not sure? Maya: Listen, I was a complete wreck! It was dark and I couldn't see my attacker... Was it a man? A woman? An adult? A child? I had no idea... I was scared out of my wits! Judge: Believe me, my dear... I'm certain I would have soiled my robes. Maya: I thought this person might attack me, so I... so I... Anyway, I'm pretty sure I screamed... I thought that it was my last hope. Phoenix: (Wow, it sounds like poor little Maya really was out of her mind. But I wonder what she meant by \"last hope\"... What do I do? Do I press her for more details...?) What did she scream? Phoenix: So you're certain that you screamed, \"Help me!\"? Maya: Umm... I think so. Now that I think about it... Yeah, that's gotta be what I screamed. Godot: Ha...! Is it all that strange, Trite, for her to have screamed, \"Help me\"? Phoenix: (No, but... Something about that bugs me... Why would you face someone that's trying to kill you... ...and go through the trouble of screaming for help?) Judge: ...Alright then, witness. Go on with your testimony. Maya: Oh. Um... OK. Leads back to cross-examination \"My last hope\" Phoenix: Wait a minute, Maya. What's this \"my last hope\" stuff? Maya: Um, what...? What do you mean by \"your last hope\"? Phoenix: No, no, no! That's what you said...! You said, \"my last hope.\" Maya: Huh? What? I said what? Phoenix: ...... Look, you were facing an attacker that you couldn't see and you screamed, right? You screamed, \"Help me!\" Maya: Um, yeah. Phoenix: But you testified that you screamed that because you thought it was your last hope. Maya: Oh... Well, you know... That's like... What do you call it when that happens... Phoenix: (Maya's not doing so well up there...) Maya: Oh, yeah. Umm, I... Oh! That's right! I remember now... I was facing my attacker, but that's not who I was screaming at. Phoenix: Wh-What did you just say...? Maya: Yeah, that's right... It was the person behind my attacker that I was yelling at. That's who I was screaming to for help! ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Wh-What is it now!? Maya: I messed up! I didn't... I didn't mean to let that slip out... Phoenix: Huh...? Judge: W-Witness! Are you absolutely sure of what you're saying? Behind the attacker... There was another person!? Maya: Um, I am... Well... I uhh, I meant to keep that part a secret. Nngh... What have I done? Godot: Ha...! \"It takes a ton of pressure to make a diamond.\" That's what I always say. Maya: A ton of pressure... Godot: ...You're in a court of law here! You can't make things up or try to hide things in this chamber. Judge: ...Witness. The information you just presented is vital to the case. I want you to add it to your testimony! Adds statement \"I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern.\" Wait and see Phoenix: (Maya is really emotionally and physically exhausted. I shouldn't go overboard. For the time being, I'll just play it by ear.) Judge: ...Alright then, witness. Go on with your testimony. Maya: Oh. Um... OK. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: You think you screamed, but you're not sure? Maya: Listen, I was a complete wreck! It was dark and I couldn't see my attacker... Was it a man? A woman? An adult? A child? I had no idea... I was scared out of my wits! Judge: Believe me, my dear... I'm certain I would have soiled my robes. Maya: I thought this person might attack me, so I... so I... Anyway, I'm pretty sure I screamed... I thought that it was my last hope. Phoenix: (Wow, it sounds like poor little Maya really was out of her mind. But I wonder what she meant by \"last hope\"...)Maya: I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A man? Who was this man? Maya: W-Well... Y-You see... I-I couldn't see. Phoenix: You couldn't see...? (She's used this excuse twice now...) Maya: Well, you know... Lantern light isn't very bright. Judge: Lantern light, did you say? Maya: There's a great big stone lantern in the garden! They always light it when an acolyte is there for training. Phoenix: ... Maya: H-Hey! You know what they say... \"Under the lantern, darkness reigns.\" So I could see the person that was further away, but not my attacker, who was closer! Plus, there weren't any other light sources in the garden at the time... Judge: Hmm...Present Stone Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"...So there was a man standing behind your attacker?\"Maya: Then something warm splashed over me...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-You don't mean...! W-Was it...? Maya: I didn't know it at the time, but... I... I think it was probably blood. Phoenix: (Is she saying that's when Ms. Deauxnim, who was channeling Dahlia... ...was stabbed in the back by the killer?) Maya: At that moment, I was paralyzed with fear... I was just sitting there in the snow. I'm sure blood got on everything around me.Maya: That's when... I lost consciousness.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So what happened next? Maya: ...I don't remember. Godot: How were you saved? You don't even remember that? Maya: No... I haven't got any idea! Umm... I really don't know what happened at all! Godot: That's too bad.Phoenix: (I've worked side by side with Maya for 3 years now. When she hides something, I can tell by how she acts. And right now...

Butz: ...Well, what did you think of my debut piece? Judge: Get that thing away from me! Larry's Sketch added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, hurry up and cross-examine him! Adds statement \"I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\" Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Could the reason you were so excited be...? Butz: What do you think!? My girlfriend was flying through the sky! Almost 30 feet above the bridge! I felt like I might start flying myself. Edgeworth: (If only you'd be so kind as to fly out of all of our lives...!) Butz: Anyway! I completely lost myself when I was drawing this scene! Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just where did you see this sight from!? Butz: Hey! No need to shout... When I was lying in bed in that run-down shack... The crack of the lightning bolt made me realize that the bridge was burning. I just watched it for a while from there, thinking how nicely it was burning! Then after about five minutes, I saw it. von Karma: The defendant \"flying\"...? Butz: That's right! That's when I decided to go to the bridge! Judge: ...I see. That all makes sense. Aside from the sketch itself... Edgeworth: (Yes... This sketch doesn't make any sense... I just need to convince the artist that his work is ludicrous.) Present Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry. What did you really see that night...?\" Butz: The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The burning bridge moved you that much, did it? ...I find that hard to believe. Butz: You moron, Edgey! You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook! von Karma: An artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad! Butz: W-W-What has that got to do with anything!? Judge: I'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness. Press (after adding statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You transfered everything \"directly onto the page\"...? And that is this sketch here? Butz: Yep! Sensational, isn't it? Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway. von Karma: It did? Butz: That's right! The reason she didn't come to me, even though I waited for her... ...Was because she was trapped on the other side of the bridge! Judge: ... Butz: Could it be that Iris... ...undertook that dangerous, despereate flight in order to reach me...!? That's gotta be it! Alright! Go, me! Nice ooooooouch! von Karma: ...Continue. Please. Butz: ...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot the passage of time to that extent, did you? Butz: Well... Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else... Edgeworth: (That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.) von Karma: Phoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts. Judge: Aside from doubts of his humanity, eh... Edgeworth: (There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!) Edgeworth: Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care. Butz: In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth! Edgeworth: If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain. Judge: What might that be...? Edgeworth: That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris! Butz: W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh! von Karma: A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim? Edgeworth: ...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct? Butz: Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah! von Karma: It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench. Edgeworth: ...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!? Butz: W-What are you talking about!? Edgeworth: ...I think you understand what I mean just fine. Butz: Why...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!? Edgeworth: What...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Butz: Edgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog! Judge: I do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage. Butz: ...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah! von Karma: ...What is it now, witness? Butz: It feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you! Edgeworth: W-What...!? Judge: What is the meaning of your outburst, witness!? Butz: ...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence. Edgeworth: \"Definitive\"...? von Karma: \"Evidence\"...? Butz: Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it! Judge: I didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality! Butz: ...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain! Edgeworth: (...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.) Witness Testimony -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Judge: A c-crystal sphere...!? Butz: This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers! von Karma: That sphere... Where did you find it? Butz: Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right. Edgeworth: And it was half-buried in the snow...? Butz: It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one! Butz: I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na\u00efve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris! Iris: ... Phoenix: (Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?) To be continued. February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Edgeworth: Wright, is this what Godot was talking about? Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask\u2606DeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: \u266aNo motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!\u266a \u266a...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...\u266a Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! \u266aGood cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...\u266a Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting\u00a0??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you. (I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant secret left to unlock... Pearls's Psyche-Lock...) [sic] Revenge (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Night of the Crime -- Phoenix: I think it's time you told the truth about what you were doing on that night. Iris: ... Phoenix: You said you were in your room at Hazakura Temple the entire time. Do you still claim that to be the truth? Iris: Yes... That's where I was. Phoenix: Iris... I believe you're innocent. That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder! Present Bikini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Iris!? I trust you, so you need to trust me. Iris: But, Mr. Wright... I can't. Phoenix: Why not? Iris: I can't trust such random nonsense! It doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I screwed up there...) Leads back to: \"Iris... I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... But mistakes just don't suit you. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: I had hoped you would get at least this much correct. I hate seeing you mess up and getting all disappointed. Phoenix: (Nngh... I didn't know she could be so harsh...) Phoenix: Iris, what are you trying to hide...? Iris: ...! Phoenix: The more you lie about it, the more I know it's got to be something really important. Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once.

Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" There were two of you. Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?) Butz: It must've been pretty scary for you, Pearl. I know what it's like. Nick used to leave me behind when I fell asleep at school, too. Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure. I couldn't even grant my mother's final wish... Phoenix: Her \"final wish\"...? Pearl: Yes.

Pearl: My mother is always nice to me... I love her very much! Butz: Yeah. Moms will do anything for their kids, right? Pearl: She said it was for the good of the Fey clan, so I knew I had to help her. I mean, Mystic Maya's part of the Fey clan, so it had to be good for her, too. That's right, isn't it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Usually, a picture is enough to channel someone's spirit, but this time... Butz: ...Pretty weird, huh? Phoenix: (Like Larry knows anything about this stuff!)

Your face has turned a really strange color. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You shouldn't work so hard, you know. You need to take a break once in a while. Phoenix: (...Being chided by a 9 year old. How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this! (I guess I'm going to have to think this through one more time from the very beginning.) Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah!

Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why.

Phoenix: In the incinerator at the Inner Temple. Pearls... You were following the instructions in this letter that night, weren't you?

Phoenix: It couldn't have been an adult... No adult would've made a simple mistake like that. Pearl: A... simple mistake? What do you mean by that? Phoenix: I'm sure you thought you were carefully following the instructions you'd been given. But you misunderstood some of the words, and this is the evidence that proves it!

Wh-Why would I d-do something like...? Phoenix: Do you remember what was written in that letter? \"Gravely roast the Master in the fires of Hades and bring our vengeance to fruition.\" But you didn't know how to read the words \"gravely\" and \"roast\" among others, right? Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea... Phoenix: Just a tiny bit. Pearl: I... I really am useless! I couldn't even burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me...

After all this time... the Master's seat is yours... (Changed from [...Now you... You are to take the place at the head of the Fey clan...] in the original release) ...My last, great wish... It seems I was just in time... To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Nothing to examine during metal detecting session Phoenix: Hmm... It doesn't look like there's anything here. Gumshoe: Hey, pal! All you gotta do is watch the detector and let IT tell YOU what's where, OK! (Changed from [Hey, pal! You've gotta watch the CHECK gauge and wait for it to flash, OK!?] in the original release) Phoenix: (Alright, already... I'm not exactly a wiz at machinery, you know...)\n-- At the Inner Temple --Maya: I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who else was on the Inner Temple side that night? Maya: Well, Sister Bikini of course! But I remember her saying that Iris would be coming later as well. Phoenix: (On the day after the incident, Edgeworth met Bikini at Hazakura Temple. That means she couldn't be the criminal.) So then... did Iris actually come later like she said? Maya: Well, umm... Let me think... Phoenix: (She seems confused. It's probably because she's so tired...) Maya: No... I'm sure I didn't see her. She must have come while I was preparing for the training.Maya: Suddenly, someone struck me over the head...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who did it? Who hit you? Maya: Ah... Well... I didn't see who it was... I was hit from behind. Phoenix: You didn't see the person...? But after that, your attacker was in front of you! How could you not see who it was!? Maya: Oh! L-Let me think for a sec... I'm sorry... I just can't remember. Phoenix: (Maya is really having a hard time... What should I do?) Leave her alone Phoenix: (Considering the conditions at the crime scene... ...it's not surprising she didn't see her attacker.) Godot: Ha...! So it looks like even you've got some compassion. Leads to: \"Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely...\" Press her harder Phoenix: ...Come on, Maya, this isn't making sense. Why didn't you see this person? Maya: Umm, well, let me think... It was... Uh... Oh yeah! That's right! It was dark, that's it! Judge: It was dark...? Maya: It's not good to have too much light around when someone is undergoing spiritual training. Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, there was earlier testimony to that effect as well. So it was dark in the garden on the night of the crime... Phoenix: (Which is why she didn't see her attacker... I thought maybe she was trying to hide something, but I guess not...) Leads to: \"Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely...\" Judge: Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely... Phoenix: ...The spirit that was channeled by Elise Deauxnim... Dahlia Hawthorne! Judge: Hmm... Very well, please continue with your testimony. What happened after you were struck on the head...?Maya: I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened afterwards!? Maya: My attacker was in front of me, blocking off my escape. ...I think. Phoenix: Y-You... think...? Maya: After getting hit like that... I-I was in a state of panic. There were only two things rolling around in my mind at the time. Judge: Well now...! This is beginning to get interesting! Phoenix: So what were the two things rolling around in your mind? Maya: Umm... \"My name is Maya Fey. One plus one equals two\"... Phoenix: ... Maya: You see, for some crazy reason, I was afraid I was going to lose my memory. I know it's odd considering my life was in danger, but that's how it was... Judge: That's not odd at all. Your actions are understandable, given the circumstances. So... What did you do then?Maya: I think I screamed, \"Help me!\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You think you screamed, but you're not sure? Maya: Listen, I was a complete wreck! It was dark and I couldn't see my attacker... Was it a man? A woman? An adult? A child? I had no idea... I was scared out of my wits! Judge: Believe me, my dear... I'm certain I would have soiled my robes. Maya: I thought this person might attack me, so I... so I... Anyway, I'm pretty sure I screamed... I thought that it was my last hope. Phoenix: (Wow, it sounds like poor little Maya really was out of her mind. But I wonder what she meant by \"last hope\"... What do I do? Do I press her for more details...?) What did she scream? Phoenix: So you're certain that you screamed, \"Help me!\"? Maya: Umm... I think so. Now that I think about it... Yeah, that's gotta be what I screamed. Godot: Ha...! Is it all that strange, Trite, for her to have screamed, \"Help me\"? Phoenix: (No, but... Something about that bugs me... Why would you face someone that's trying to kill you... ...and go through the trouble of screaming for help?) Judge: ...Alright then, witness. Go on with your testimony. Maya: Oh. Um... OK. Leads back to cross-examination \"My last hope\" Phoenix: Wait a minute, Maya. What's this \"my last hope\" stuff? Maya: Um, what...? What do you mean by \"your last hope\"? Phoenix: No, no, no! That's what you said...! You said, \"my last hope.\" Maya: Huh? What? I said what? Phoenix: ...... Look, you were facing an attacker that you couldn't see and you screamed, right? You screamed, \"Help me!\" Maya: Um, yeah. Phoenix: But you testified that you screamed that because you thought it was your last hope. Maya: Oh... Well, you know... That's like... What do you call it when that happens... Phoenix: (Maya's not doing so well up there...) Maya: Oh, yeah. Umm, I... Oh! That's right! I remember now... I was facing my attacker, but that's not who I was screaming at. Phoenix: Wh-What did you just say...? Maya: Yeah, that's right... It was the person behind my attacker that I was yelling at. That's who I was screaming to for help! ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Wh-What is it now!? Maya: I messed up! I didn't... I didn't mean to let that slip out... Phoenix: Huh...? Judge: W-Witness! Are you absolutely sure of what you're saying? Behind the attacker... There was another person!? Maya: Um, I am... Well... I uhh, I meant to keep that part a secret. Nngh... What have I done? Godot: Ha...! \"It takes a ton of pressure to make a diamond.\" That's what I always say. Maya: A ton of pressure... Godot: ...You're in a court of law here! You can't make things up or try to hide things in this chamber. Judge: ...Witness. The information you just presented is vital to the case. I want you to add it to your testimony! Adds statement \"I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern.\" Wait and see Phoenix: (Maya is really emotionally and physically exhausted. I shouldn't go overboard. For the time being, I'll just play it by ear.) Judge: ...Alright then, witness. Go on with your testimony. Maya: Oh. Um... OK. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: You think you screamed, but you're not sure? Maya: Listen, I was a complete wreck! It was dark and I couldn't see my attacker... Was it a man? A woman? An adult? A child? I had no idea... I was scared out of my wits! Judge: Believe me, my dear... I'm certain I would have soiled my robes. Maya: I thought this person might attack me, so I... so I... Anyway, I'm pretty sure I screamed... I thought that it was my last hope. Phoenix: (Wow, it sounds like poor little Maya really was out of her mind. But I wonder what she meant by \"last hope\"...)Maya: I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A man? Who was this man? Maya: W-Well... Y-You see... I-I couldn't see. Phoenix: You couldn't see...? (She's used this excuse twice now...) Maya: Well, you know... Lantern light isn't very bright. Judge: Lantern light, did you say? Maya: There's a great big stone lantern in the garden! They always light it when an acolyte is there for training. Phoenix: ... Maya: H-Hey! You know what they say... \"Under the lantern, darkness reigns.\" So I could see the person that was further away, but not my attacker, who was closer! Plus, there weren't any other light sources in the garden at the time... Judge: Hmm...Present Stone Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"...So there was a man standing behind your attacker?\"Maya: Then something warm splashed over me...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-You don't mean...! W-Was it...? Maya: I didn't know it at the time, but... I... I think it was probably blood. Phoenix: (Is she saying that's when Ms. Deauxnim, who was channeling Dahlia... ...was stabbed in the back by the killer?) Maya: At that moment, I was paralyzed with fear... I was just sitting there in the snow. I'm sure blood got on everything around me.Maya: That's when... I lost consciousness.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So what happened next? Maya: ...I don't remember. Godot: How were you saved? You don't even remember that? Maya: No... I haven't got any idea! Umm... I really don't know what happened at all! Godot: That's too bad.Phoenix: (I've worked side by side with Maya for 3 years now. When she hides something, I can tell by how she acts. And right now... I'm absolutely certain she's hiding something!)Phoenix: ...So there was a man standing behind your attacker?Maya: Umm... yeah.Phoenix: That man... He's the killer. He stabbed her from behind. He's the one who killed Elise Deauxnim... Otherwise known as... Misty Fey, your mother.Maya: The killer...!Phoenix: Maya... You know who killed your mother, don't you.Maya: Umm...Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: To be frank, Your Honor, I think she is in shock and quite confused. That's why she hasn't noticed the huge problem with her testimony.Maya: H-Huh? What do you mean? What problem...?Phoenix: ...Maya. On the night of the crime... that stone lantern was out of commission.Maya: Huh... What!?Phoenix: ...It's true. There was no light anywhere in the garden that night.Maya: N-No!Judge: Order! Order in the court! M-Mr. Godot! Explain this!Godot: ...Add the pureness of milk to the perfect, clear darkness of coffee. Stir. That is the state of the witness's mind right now -- a cup of caf\u00e9 au lait.Judge: C-Caf\u00e9 o' Lay? Is that even legal...?Godot: Mr. Trite's words are the milk and you are the spoon, Your Honor.Judge: I-I'm a spoon!? I'm no spoony bard, I'll have you know!Godot: You must have noticed it too, Trite. ...This witness's mental state is highly unstable right now. It's not hard to understand why she would make a little mistake like that.Phoenix:Phoenix: Sorry, but that's not going to cut it!Godot: ...What did you say!?Phoenix: If there truly was no light in the garden... ...then there's a fatal contradiction in the witness's last bit of testimony!Maya: N-Nick...Phoenix: ...May I? Recall the witness's statement about her attacker. She said that she didn't know if it was a man or a woman, an adult or a child. ...And yet! The witness could describe a person that was standing behind her attacker... And she quite clearly described him as a man!Maya: Ah...!Phoenix: ...In other words! That would have to mean that Maya actually saw our mystery person! Despite it being so dark that she couldn't see the face of her own attacker! (Changed from [Despite it being so dark that she couldn't see the face of the attacker in front of her!] in the original release)Maya: N... NOOOOOOOOOO!Judge: Or-Order! Order! Order! What in the world does this all mean, Mr. Wright!? Are you saying Ms. Fey saw the real killer under pitch black conditions!?Godot:Godot: Trite! Do you have any idea what you're proposing? How could she have seen in the dark? There was no other light source at the scene!Phoenix:Phoenix: There are some things that you can only see in the dark, Mr. Godot.Godot: ...!Phoenix: Maya, you did see who the killer was in the dark. And now... you're trying to cover for him.Judge: C-Cover...!? For the man that killed her mother...!?Phoenix: There's only one conclusion I can draw from this... You know who this man is!Maya: ...... ... Please... Nick... I don't know anything... Please... I'm begging you...Godot: ...Ha! You talk a good game, Trite. But let's see if you can walk the walk. It was pitch black. So what could the witness see? I'm calling your bluff!Maya: N-No, Nick! Don't...! P-Please! Stop...!Phoenix: (Maya is dead set on protecting this guy... The man who murdered Maya's long-lost mother...! But... I can't let him get away with it. I'm a lawyer. An officer of the court. I'm here to find the truth!)Judge: ...Alright, Mr. Wright. Time to show us what you've got. Who was this person that you say Ms. Fey saw in the darkness...?Present Godot profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Because it was pitch black, Ms. Fey was able to recognize the killer easily.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: It looks like you've proven a well-known fact. The fact that people really CAN'T see in the dark! Phoenix: Urk... Godot: You're just the man I thought you were... You should try a nice, sweet caf\u00e9 au lait at least once in your life, Trite! Phoenix: ...... (B-But I'm sure she saw the killer in the dark...! So the answer is clear! What is visible in the dark!?) Leads back to: \"...Alright, Mr. Wright. Time to show us what you've got.\"Phoenix: Because it was pitch black, Ms. Fey was able to recognize the killer easily. I'm sure the court would like to see for itself how this is possible, yes?Judge: What!? B-But how do you propose to show us something like that!?Phoenix: ...It's easy. We just need to recreate the conditions of that night.Judge: C-Conditions...?Phoenix: Your Honor! The defense officially requests... ...that all the lights in this courtroom be turned off!Judge: ... Wh... Wh... This is... ...But it can't be...!Godot:...Ha...That was a nice bit of deduction... Trite.Phoenix: Well, everyone...? This is the man Maya saw on the night of the murder!Judge: Order! Order! Order! Prosecutor Godot! What is the meaning of this!?Godot: ...Judge: Surely you must be shocked to hear yourself accused of such a thing! Why aren't you denying it!?Godot: Ha...! Your Honor. You're asking the wrong person.Judge: Wh-What do you mean by that!?Godot: If you've got a question, ask the witness... That's one of my rules.Phoenix: Well, Maya!? How about it? What you saw that night... Was it 3 glowing red lights?Maya: ...Judge: Well, witness? Answer the question.Maya: ... Y... You're wrong! I-I... I never saw that!Phoenix: M-Maya!Maya: I thought the person that stabbed my mother was a man... ...for a totally different reason!Phoenix: Wha-Whaat?Judge: W-Witness... M-Mr. Wright, what the...!?Godot:Godot: Stop your chattering, Your Honor.Judge: Ch-Ch-Chattering...?Godot: If it's worth asking, ask the witness. That's one of my rules.Judge: ...... Alright. Well then, let's continue with the testimony. Please tell us how you knew the killer was a man!Maya: ...Y-Yes, Your Honor. I didn't realize it until after I woke up, but...Witness Testimony-- The Killer --Maya: ...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor. By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed... The torches were lit... And the body was gone. And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too. Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...Judge: Hmm... So it was after the crime took place that the witness came to think the killer was a man.Maya: Yes... That's right...I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...Judge: No need to apologize. It's as Mr. Godot said... You're utterly exhausted. It's only natural that you would be a little confused.Godot: ...Judge: Also, if you consider the situation you described... ...it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to assume the criminal was a man. Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Killer --Maya: ...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you lost consciousness when you were in the garden. Is that right? Maya: Yes. I think... I think it happened when the v-victim was stabbed. Phoenix: So then the person that carried you into the Inner Temple...? Judge: It could only have been the killer...! Godot: ... Maya: That's what I think, too. Phoenix: (So the killer carried Maya into the Inner Temple...)Maya: By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... ...... I don't know. Phoenix: (It looks like she doesn't have enough confidence. I think I need to gather some more information before I ask her again...)Press (after pressing third and fourth statements) Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something. Phoenix: You did? Maya: Yes... I felt like the killer was hiding the evidence for me... for my sake... Judge: Wh-What? Hiding it for you...!? Maya: Everyone knew that I was the only one at the Inner Temple that night. If Sister Bikini had come back and looked at the garden... Phoenix: ...She may have thought that you had done it... Judge: ...No, she definitely would have thought so. And you're saying that's why the killer... ...cleaned up the crime scene to make it look like nothing had happened...? Maya: Yes. I'm sure of it. Judge: Well, that's certainly an important piece of information! I want you to add that to your testimony! Maya: Yes, Your Honor... Adds statement \"I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.\"Press (after pressing third and fourth statements; subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something. Phoenix: You did?Maya: I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: They did it for your sake...? Maya: Well... If the body and the blood hadn't been removed... ...I would've immediately been the prime suspect, right? Judge: Yes, I suppose that's true. Phoenix: (Yeah, and if that happened, the body would have caused some other problems, too. If her real identity had come out right then, it would have been terrible. \"Master of Kurain Killed by Own Daughter!\" I don't think Maya would've been able to handle it...) Judge: But still... It's rather difficult to fathom the killer's motives. What reason is there to go through that much trouble to protect you...? Maya: ...Present Stone Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard.\"Maya: The torches were lit... And the body was gone.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The torches were lit? Maya: Yes. That's how I noticed that the whole scene had changed. Phoenix: (I'm going to say it was the killer who lit the torches... I mean, who else could it be?) Judge: The killer probably lit them since it'd be impossible to do any cover-up work in the dark. However, if that's true, there's one thing that still bothers me. Why did the killer go to the effort of moving the body? Phoenix: (That's true... It's hard to see how that would be of any advantage to the killer. The only one who would gain anything from that would be... ...the only person that was at the Inner Temple, Maya.) Maya: ... Judge: Very well... Let me hear some more about the condition of the crime scene.Maya: And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're saying the killer cleaned up the snow? (It did look really odd... The snow was removed in an unnatural-looking rectangular shape around the lantern...) Maya: There were a lot of shovels around the Inner Temple. But they're all really heavy. Way too heavy for me to use. Judge: ...An odd fellow indeed, this killer. Why on earth would anyone want to take snow away? Phoenix: Well there's one thing I can think of... Didn't you say that a lot of the victim's blood sprayed onto the snow? Maya: Y-Yeah... The area I collapsed in ended up being splattered. Phoenix: In other words... ...the killer's purpose was to hide the bloody snow. I think that's the most reasonable explanation. Judge: Hmm, perhaps... However, there's something that's bothering me. If the killer just wanted to hide the snow with blood on it... ...there was no need to remove that amount. Phoenix: (That's true... He could have scooped up just the snow that was stained with blood.) Judge: It looks like there are some mysteries behind this issue. Maya: ...But, I think this will help explain them!Maya: Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you're saying that you never saw the killer, right? Maya: Y-Yes. Phoenix: But earlier you very clearly stated that... ...you saw a man behind your attacker. Maya: ... Nick... I'm sorry...Phoenix: (The killer certainly went through a lot of trouble... Moving the body by pendulum, manipulating the crime scene... But for what purpose...? Why do all that? Maybe Maya knows more than she's letting on...)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nTestimony 1: By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed... Maybe something about the garden's state?\n\nTestimony 2: I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence. This is about motive, maybe? Not sure which evidence would contradict that.\n\nTestimony 3: The torches were lit... And the body was gone. The torches being lit. Wait, there's an evidence called Stone Lantern (20) which says it was not lit the night of the crime. If Maya says the torches were lit, but the Stone Lantern evidence says it wasn't, that's a contradiction.\n\nTestimony 4: All the snow around the stone lantern had been cleaned up. The Stone Lantern (20) might relate, but not directly about snow.\n\nTestimony 5: Assumed it was a man because the work was done alone. Maybe not directly contradicted by evidence.\n\nSo focusing on Testimony 3 about the torches being lit. The evidence Stone Lantern (20) states that the lantern was not lit that night. But wait, the testimony mentions torches being lit, not the stone lantern specifically. Let me check the evidence again.\n\nEvidence 20: Stone Lantern. Description: A lantern from the Inner Temple garden. Was not lit the night of the crime. If the stone lantern wasn't lit, but Maya says the torches were lit, maybe the torches are different. Wait, the torches in the garden might be separate from the stone lantern. Hmm. Alternatively, if the stone lantern wasn't lit, but the torches (other light sources) were lit, that might not contradict. But maybe the evidence refers to the garden's lighting in general. Wait, the Stone Lantern's description says it was not lit, but Maya's testimony 3 says the torches were lit. So the torches being lit would be separate from the stone lantern. Then maybe the contradiction isn't here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe another angle. Let's look at Evidence 20: Stone Lantern. The testimony in question is Testimony 3: The torches were lit. But if the Stone Lantern was not lit, but the torches were, maybe that's not a direct contradiction. Maybe another piece of evidence?\n\nWait, let me check other evidence. Evidence 19: Dagger. Not directly related. Evidence 18: Burnt Letter. Maybe not. Evidence 17: Kurain Master's Talisman. No. Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere. No. Evidence 15: Larry's Sketch. Unrelated. Evidence 14: Tracks Photo. No. Evidence 13: Crime Photo. Maybe shows the scene. Evidence 12: Iris's Testimony. No. Evidence 11: Shichishito. Not relevant here. Evidence 10: Victim's Staff. Maybe not. Evidence 7: Weather Data. Hmm, not directly. Evidence 4: Hanging Scroll. No. Evidence 3: Hazakura Temple Map. Maybe not.\n\nWait, the key point is in Testimony 3: Maya says the torches were lit when she returned to the garden. However, the Stone Lantern (Evidence 20) was not lit. But the torches and the stone lantern are different things. So maybe the contradiction isn't here. Let me check another testimony.\n\nLooking at Testimony 4: \"And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.\" The evidence related to the snow cleanup would be the Kurain Master's Talisman (17) found in the garden. But how does that contradict? Alternatively, maybe the Crime Photo (13) shows the garden without snow, but the weather data says it was snowing. Wait, the Weather Data (7) says snow stopped around 10:50 PM. If the crime happened after that, the snow might have stopped. But Maya's testimony is about the snow being cleaned up. Not sure.\n\nWait, another angle. Maya's Testimony 3 says the torches were lit. The Stone Lantern (20) was not lit, but if the torches were separate light sources, maybe that's not the contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the torches were not lit either. Wait, in the story, during the investigation, when Phoenix examines the torches in the garden, it's mentioned that the torches were lit on the night of the murder. But according to the evidence, maybe the Stone Lantern was not lit, but the torches were. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the testimony, Maya says that when she came back, the torches were lit. But earlier in the story, it's established that during the training, the torches are not lit because too much light isn't conducive. Sister Bikini mentions that. So if the torches were lit after the crime, but the normal procedure is not to have them lit during training, perhaps the killer lit them. But how does this contradict evidence?\n\nAlternatively, the Stone Lantern (Evidence 20) states that it was not lit. If Maya's testimony refers to the stone lantern being lit, but the evidence says it wasn't, that's a contradiction. But in Testimony 3, she says \"the torches were lit\", not the stone lantern. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nLet me think again. The key contradiction might be between Testimony 3 (torches were lit) and the Stone Lantern (Evidence 20) not being lit. But they are different things. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the torches were not supposed to be lit, and the evidence about the stone lantern not being lit supports that. Wait, but the torches being lit could be a separate action by the killer, so it's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, another possible contradiction: Maya says the torches were lit when she returned, but the stone lantern wasn't lit. But that's not a contradiction because they're different light sources. Maybe another piece of evidence?\n\nWait, the Burnt Letter (18) includes instructions from Morgan Fey to Pearls. But how does that relate to the torches?\n\nAlternatively, the Hanging Scroll (4) with Misty Fey's image covered in gravy. That's a different point.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is in Testimony 3: \"The torches were lit... And the body was gone.\" The torches being lit would require someone to light them. But according to the Stone Lantern (20) evidence, the stone lantern wasn't lit, but the torches were. However, the torches are separate. So maybe no contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the torches being lit contradicts the fact that the crime scene was initially dark. Wait, during the crime, it was dark, but after the cleanup, the killer lit the torches. That's possible, so no contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check other testimonies.\n\nTestimony 2: \"I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.\" Which evidence would contradict this? Maybe the Burnt Letter (18) from Morgan Fey, which shows that the cleanup was part of a plan, not for Maya's sake. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the Dagger (19) found in the garden with blood not matching the victim. If the killer cleaned up, why leave the dagger? But that's not directly a contradiction.\n\nWait, let me look back at the problem. The user provided the list of testimonies and evidence. The task is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony.\n\nThe key here is that during Maya's testimony, she says the torches were lit when she returned to the garden (Testimony 3). However, the Stone Lantern (Evidence 20) was not lit that night. But the torches and the stone lantern are different. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nWait, another angle: The torches were lit after the crime, but the weather data (Evidence 7) mentions that the snow stopped around 10:50 PM. If the torches were lit after the snow stopped, that's possible. But how does that contradict?\n\nWait, the user might be referring to the fact that Maya said the torches were lit, but the stone lantern wasn't. But if the stone lantern is part of the garden's lighting, and the torches are separate, then there's no contradiction. So perhaps this isn't the right pair.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 4: \"And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.\" The evidence Kurain Master's Talisman (17) was found in the garden half-buried in the snow. If the snow was cleaned up, how was the talisman half-buried? That's a contradiction. Because if the killer cleaned the snow around the stone lantern, the talisman should have been found on the cleared ground, not half-buried. So the talisman being found in the snow contradicts the testimony that the snow was cleaned up.\n\nSo the testimony in question is Testimony 4: the snow was cleaned up, but Evidence 17 (Kurain Master's Talisman) was found half-buried in the snow. That suggests the snow wasn't cleaned up, which contradicts the testimony.\n\nBut the user's evidence list says Kurain Master's Talisman (17) was found in the garden. So if the snow was cleaned up, the talisman should have been exposed, not half-buried. Therefore, the existence of the talisman in the snow contradicts the testimony that the snow was cleaned.\n\nTherefore, the pair would be evidence 17 (Kurain Master's Talisman) and testimony 4 (snow cleaned up). But wait, the testimony says the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. The talisman was found in the garden, but maybe not near the stone lantern. Hmm, this depends on the exact location.\n\nAlternatively, the Burnt Letter (18) found in the incinerator contradicts the testimony about the cleanup. If the killer cleaned up, why leave the letter? Not sure.\n\nWait, the key contradiction here is probably between Testimony 3 (torches lit) and Evidence 20 (stone lantern not lit). But if the torches are separate from the stone lantern, that's not a contradiction. Alternatively, the torches in the garden were part of the stone lantern? No.\n\nWait, looking at the evidence list, Evidence 20: Stone Lantern. Description: Was not lit the night of the crime. But Maya's Testimony 3 says the torches were lit. The torches are different from the stone lantern. So no direct contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the answer is not here.\n\nAlternatively, the Tracks Photo (14) shows tracks from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If the killer moved the body to Hazakura Temple, the tracks would be present. But how does that contradict the testimony?\n\nAnother angle: The victim's staff (Evidence 10) has a hidden sword, which is the real murder weapon. If the killer cleaned up, why leave the staff? But not directly related.\n\nWait, the key contradiction is when Maya says the torches were lit, but the stone lantern wasn't. But they are different. Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, the Burnt Letter (18) includes instructions that Pearls should channel Dahlia's spirit at the time of the lights out bell. But Maya's testimony says she heard the bell and went to the Inner Temple. If Pearls was supposed to channel at that time, but Maya was there, that's a connection, but not a contradiction.\n\nWait, going back to the initial problem: The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The correct answer is likely the Stone Lantern (20) and Testimony 3 (torches were lit). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Stone Lantern's description says it wasn't lit, but the torches were. So that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maya's Testimony 3 says the torches were lit, but during the crime, the garden was dark. The torches were not supposed to be lit during training, as stated by Sister Bikini. Therefore, the fact that the torches were lit after the crime contradicts the normal procedure, but that's not an evidence contradiction. The evidence about the Stone Lantern not being lit is separate.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is likely the Kurain Master's Talisman (17) and Testimony 4. Because if the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up, the talisman would not have been half-buried. So evidence 17 contradicts testimony 4.\n\nBut the testimony says the snow was cleaned up around the stone lantern. The talisman was found in the garden, perhaps not near the stone lantern? If the talisman was found in an area where the snow was cleaned, then it's a contradiction. But the evidence description says the talisman was found half-buried in the snow. So if the snow was cleaned up, it shouldn't be half-buried. Therefore, the testimony and evidence contradict each other.\n\nSo the JSON answer should be {\"evidence\": 17, \"testimony\": 4}."

I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth! Edgeworth: If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain. Judge: What might that be...? Edgeworth: That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris! Butz: W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh! von Karma: A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim? Edgeworth: ...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct? Butz: Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah! von Karma: It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench. Edgeworth: ...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!? Butz: W-What are you talking about!? Edgeworth: ...I think you understand what I mean just fine. Butz: Why...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!? Edgeworth: What...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Butz: Edgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog! Judge: I do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage. Butz: ...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah! von Karma: ...What is it now, witness? Butz: It feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you! Edgeworth: W-What...!? Judge: What is the meaning of your outburst, witness!? Butz: ...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence. Edgeworth: \"Definitive\"...? von Karma: \"Evidence\"...? Butz: Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it! Judge: I didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality! Butz: ...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain! Edgeworth: (...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.) Witness Testimony -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Judge: A c-crystal sphere...!? Butz: This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers! von Karma: That sphere... Where did you find it? Butz: Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right. Edgeworth: And it was half-buried in the snow...? Butz: It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge. Judge: Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere! Butz: ...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward! Judge: Hmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release) von Karma: ...? Judge: Oh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release) Edgeworth: (What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release) Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record. Butz: You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore! Edgeworth: (...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?) Cross Examination -- Proof That Iris Flew! -- Butz: When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So, you went to the burning bridge? Butz: That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway! Judge: But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say? Butz: I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best. Edgeworth: (It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...) Judge: So... what did you do next? Butz: I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you searched all over for her? Butz: She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know... Edgeworth: ... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called \"landing\"? Butz: Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there. Judge: You... fell over yourself? Butz: Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there! Edgeworth: ... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.) Judge: The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her \"landing\", correct? Then what happened next? Butz: That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Half-buried\"...? Butz: It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too. Judge: I'm impressed... You did well to find it! Butz: No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I \"borrowed\" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, \"Here I am!\" to me. Edgeworth: It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night? Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one! Butz: I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her! Edgeworth: (This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.) Judge: However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from? Edgeworth: (That is the question I aim to answer.) Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Butz: After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was \"Iris\"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct? Butz: That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound! Judge: Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today. Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise, or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...Larry.\" Edgeworth: (This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!) Edgeworth: ...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere. Butz: Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!? Edgeworth: Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot! von Karma: The victim...!? Edgeworth: I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere. Butz: H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch! von Karma: ...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach. Edgeworth: (They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime! Judge: ...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone! Butz: W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? Judge: J-Just what does this mean!? Edgeworth: If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either! Judge: T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!? von Karma: von Karma: A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected! Butz: Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz! von Karma: ...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring! Edgeworth: You honestly believe that...? von Karma: Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns! Butz: Why are you pointing at me!? Edgeworth: The victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!? von Karma: von Karma: That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder. Judge: After the murder? von Karma: There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release) Butz: ... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh! von Karma: All joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case! Edgeworth: (She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!) Judge: Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time! von Karma: Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?) Yes, I can. Edgeworth: (\"Can I prove it...?\" That isn't the issue. To simply \"prove it\". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" No, it is impossible. Edgeworth: (No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.) von Karma: Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say. Judge: Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason... Butz: Butz: What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now... Edgeworth: ...! Butz: If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed! Edgeworth: ... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!) Leads to: \"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you.\" Edgeworth: ...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case! Judge: You will do what!? von Karma: That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered. Edgeworth: That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!) Judge: I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder! Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Judge: ...Your response, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now! Butz: Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win! Edgeworth: (His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!) Judge: ...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here? Edgeworth: O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!) Leads back to: \"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Edgeworth: This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct? Butz: That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it! Edgeworth: ...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear. Judge: W-What...? Edgeworth: When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly... von Karma: Snowing...? Edgeworth: On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body. Judge: Ah...! Edgeworth: ...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder! von Karma: Wha... Whaaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release) Judge: What... What could that have been!? Edgeworth: This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there? von Karma: ...! Edgeworth: Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge! von Karma: von Karma: The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness! Edgeworth: Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body. von Karma: Th-That's the same thing! Edgeworth: ...No, it isn't! von Karma: ! Edgeworth: ...You said it yourself. von Karma: Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed. Edgeworth: If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding! von Karma: von Karma: You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!? Edgeworth: (I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release)) Judge: Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple! Present Tracks Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"On that snowy night...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: (No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!) Judge: ...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind! Leads back to: \"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation.\" Edgeworth: On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile. von Karma: Ah...! Edgeworth: As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah! von Karma: This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave! Edgeworth: What do you mean!? von Karma: The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...? Edgeworth: Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation! von Karma: W-What!? Edgeworth: ...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean? von Karma: Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point. Butz: Ed-Edgey! Thank you...! Judge: ...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances. von Karma: Grrr... Grrrrrr! Edgeworth: (Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner. von Karma: Excuse me...? Edgeworth: There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright! Butz: R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch! von Karma: Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel! Edgeworth: A shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release) Butz: What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy! von Karma: ...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for! Butz: Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch! von Karma: I demand satisfaction! Judge: ...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution. Edgeworth: (And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...) von Karma: ... Judge: Court is now adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!? Judge: I don't think there is a problem with it. Edgeworth: Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it. Judge: ... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty! Edgeworth: (It would appear that even I can make mistakes...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that. Edgeworth: Well done, Your Honor. Judge: W-What? Edgeworth: I was only testing you just now. Judge: ... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!? Edgeworth: (It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence! Judge: It does? How do you mean? Edgeworth: Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does! Judge: ... Don't try to play mind games with me! Edgeworth: (Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Bridge to the Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 February 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit Phoenix: I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow! (Changed from [But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!] in the original release) February 9, 2:43 PMDusky Bridge Edgeworth: Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face. Gumshoe: Or maybe \"viridian\", in artist-speak. Phoenix: Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit. Gumshoe: How's your temperature now? Phoenix: Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances. Edgeworth: We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon. Phoenix: Yeah... Edgeworth: In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about... Phoenix: (Another sword, huh...) Gumshoe: Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat! Phoenix: ...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here. Edgeworth: Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into... Phoenix: And that is...? Edgeworth: Our client's background, naturally. Gumshoe: You mean Iris, sir...? Edgeworth: I have the feeling that we've met before. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you... Phoenix: I'm sorry, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care. Gumshoe: Guess I should get moving, too. Phoenix: Why? Do you need to be somewhere? Gumshoe: Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side. Phoenix: (Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...) Gumshoe: But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know. Phoenix: Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Gumshoe: No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off! Phoenix: (Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!) Examine Cliff on other side Phoenix: It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there. But I can't see the Inner Temple from here. I really hope Maya's OK... Wooden sign on left side Phoenix: There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall. Looks like someone's taken the effort to write \"To Heavenly Hall\" on the signpost. Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. Which reminds me... If my memory serves me correctly, Edgeworth isn't exactly a fan of earthquakes. Boulder Phoenix: Now it really is more of a \"Dusty Bridge\" than a \"Dusky Bridge\". That kidnapping incident happened here 11 years ago, so maybe it's cursed, too. Public phone Phoenix: Hazakura Temple doesn't have a single private phone line... ...and there aren't any houses in the area, so I guess Bikini is the only one who uses this. ...I really wish I had brought my cell phone with me. February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: ... (Looks like no one's here...) Larryyy! ... Lauriiice! ... (I was sure he'd be hiding here... Guess I'll try again later.) Examine Eagle River Phoenix: This is the famous Eagle River. I got to try out its rough rapids the other night. They say it has a really strong current. And they weren't kidding. It's both powerful and fast-flowing. ... I was dead lucky... I mean lucky not to be dead! Dusky Bridge Phoenix: That's Dusky Bridge up there. It's amazing how clearly you can see it from so far away. Larry supposedly saw everything through the shack's window. Not much light gets down here, so it must be pitch black at night... But this area was probably illuminated that night because of the burning bridge above. Stairs Phoenix: These steps lead up to the foot of Dusky Bridge. Coming down is a cinch, but going back up doesn't look like a walk in the park. I'm starting to understand why rivers always want to flow downstream, not up. Flags Phoenix: That stuff is really ruining the beautiful atmosphere around here. It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini in a bikini! *shudder* ...I've gotta think of the kittens... Shack Phoenix: Look at this graffiti, scrawled right on the front of the shack. At least he managed to get a pretty good likeness. When I really think about it, I guess art kind of suits him. I mean, his very existence is an art... of sorts. Roof Phoenix: The snow is really piled up on the straw roof. It's otherworldly... Like something out of a fairy tale. ...Well, the roof part anyway. The sign says, \"Heavenly Hall\". I guess it's pretty fitting. If you spent a night in this little freezing shack... ...you'd probably find yourself at the pearly gates by morning. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate ???: Come on! Pleeease! It's for art's sake! I swear! Phoenix: (There's only one guy I know who could be this persistent and high-strung...) Butz: I'm talking about the heroine here! The heroine in my book. It'll make you famous. Aaagh! von Karma: ...Enough! A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree... Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: Huh? Me? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release) Wait a second... I-I know you... You're... Um... Oww! von Karma: Your reflexes and mind need to shape up! Phoenix: (My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want to grill me over a name!?) Butz: Franzy! You can't do that! Even as we speak, Nick's on the brink of death! ...Or so I'm told. von Karma: \"Whip a dead horse!\" Isn't that one of your American sayings? Phoenix: No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything. Butz: Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? Tell her she NEEDS to model for my new picture book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! (Changed from [She must model for my picture book, \"Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple & Magnificent\"!] in the original release) Gaaah! von Karma: Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony. Phoenix: And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry. Butz: ... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize! Phoenix: (*sigh* Off he goes...) von Karma: Hmph. It's amazing how little has changed with you in in the past year, Phoenix Wright. (Changed from [Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.] in the original release) Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. von Karma: Compared to the grandeur of the main gate at the Von Karma Estate, it's but a pet door. Phoenix: It looks really idyllic with all that snow on it, don't you think? von Karma: All that snow? Don't make me laugh. This is but a light dusting where I come from. Phoenix: ... Don't make things up just because you think I'll never get to see it for myself! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. von Karma: I wonder how the head nun is holding up...? Phoenix: Oh, wow. Is that an inkling of human kindness I sense? Oww! von Karma: Do you enjoy causing other people pain with that sharp tongue of yours? Phoenix: (It's nothing compared to the pain you cause with that leathery whip of yours...) Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I'd love to know what that thing was used for on the night of the crime. von Karma: Hah! Still thinking small I see, Phoenix Wright. Or perhaps, not at all. That's why you will never defeat me! Phoenix: Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't recall ever losing to you. von Karma: It's time for us to settle this once and for all with one final showdown! Phoenix: (Looks like she mentally blocked out my victories over her from her memory...) Talk Franziska von Karma Phoenix: Have you been in Germany all this time? von Karma: That's right. Extending my perfect win record. Naturally. Phoenix: (Oh, joy. Sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Has it really been a year since we first met...?) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: (Franziska was born and raised in Germany, and became a prosecutor at the age of 13. Her father was the legendary prosecutor, Manfred von Karma. He had a perfect win record for 40 long years... But now, he is gone from this world...) Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me... ...because of what happened to your father... von Karma: ... Phoenix Wright. You will fall before me. This, I promise. But it will be for my sake, not my father's... Are we clear? Phoenix: ...Yes, crystal. Today's trial von Karma: In truth, I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead, it was my little brother who was leading the defense. Phoenix: (Edgeworth... Come to think of it... ...Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.) von Karma: Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you. Phoenix: Because it does. von Karma: And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better! Phoenix: ... (It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) Oww! von Karma: No smirking! Phoenix: No whipping the sick! von Karma: That foolish fool, doing such a foolish favor for such a foolishly foolish fool. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) von Karma: Make no mistake, Phoenix Wright. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. To pulverize you. Phoenix: ...It's not like I thought you were here to bring me some Coldkiller X, you know. What happened von Karma: I went over the whole case file on the flight over. Phoenix: You read the whole thing? von Karma: Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers? Phoenix: No. The only thought in my mind was, \"I have to get across.\" von Karma: ...! A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks. Phoenix: (Gumshoe said he'd let me know once the bridge was repaired. Maya... She's got to be OK. I just know it. Plus, I need to ask her about what really happened at the Inner Temple that night...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, about this... Yeow! von Karma: I refuse to help you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I should've known better than to try...) February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall ???: Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (...That was one long sigh!) Umm... Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! I didn't know you were here! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: Um, you don't have to pretend to be in a good mood for my sake... Bikini: I... I suppose I've made a terrible mess of things, haven't I? I let Mystic Elise die, and then there's Iris as well... Phoenix: (\"Mystic Elise\"...? Now that I think about it... Hmm...) Bikini: There's an acolyte stuck at the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: That little girl...? Y-You don't mean Pearls... do you? Bikini: Yes, I'm afraid I do! She hasn't been seen since the morning after the incident. Phoenix: Pearls? She's missing!? (Why didn't anyone tell me about this!?) (Changed from [(Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier!?)] in the original release) Examine Things on floor Phoenix: I've only seen a layout like this when I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. Wow! This hibachi brazier really puts out a lot of heat! Just thinking about how happy we were, sitting here eating pot roast and gravy... *sigh* Talk Iris Bikini: I must be getting old... I think I've seriously lost faith in myself. Phoenix: Are you talking about your performance at the trial today? Bikini: You believe me, don't you? I'm not a liar! I would never lie! I know what I saw! I saw Iris pull that sword from Mystic Elise's body that night... I'm certain of it! At least, I was until this morning... Phoenix: (I don't see any Psyche-Locks, so she must be telling the truth.) Um... So why are you so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? Bikini: You know that artist who testified after me? Butz: I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering! I felt like I might start flying myself. Bikini: When I saw that man testify so fervently about something so impossible... ...I started to wonder if I had acted just like him when I was on the witness stand. Phoenix: I wouldn't take that guy too seriously. He's an artist, but all he draws is trouble... and nothing else. (If both Bikini and Larry are telling the truth... ...that can only mean one thing. They both didn't see what they think they saw.) Inner Temple Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you met Iris at the Inner Temple. Is that correct? Bikini: That's right. I'm sure it was Iris. Phoenix: (But Iris claims she was in her room in Hazakura Temple.) Bikini: I knew I shouldn't have come back here that night... Phoenix: But because you did, Maya is stuck all by herself at the Inner Temple. (Changed from [But because you did, Maya is stuck at the Inner Temple.] in the original release) Bikini: Nngh... I am so sorry. The drafts in that place are nothing to shake a stick at. Winter is especially bad. Phoenix: (I'll bet. The Training Hall looks like it's about to fall down any second.) Bikini: Eagle Mountain has always been prone to earthquakes, just so you know. Phoenix: E-Earthquakes...? Bikini: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the next big one levels the Training Hall. Phoenix: (We've got to get Maya out of there... fast!) Bikini: But still. There's really no need to worry... That area on the other side of Dusky Bridge is isolated like an island. Phoenix: It's like an island? How so? Bikini: Well, the only thing on that side of the bridge is the Inner Temple. No one lives out there, and it's surrounded on all sides by the river or the forest. Phoenix: I-I see... Bikini: So a criminal would be trapped should they choose to flee in that direction. And as long as the bridge is out of commission, he or she will have to stay there. Phoenix: ... That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer, and with no way of escape either! (Changed from [That means Maya could be stuck out there with a murderer and no way to escape either!] in the original release) Bikini: Oh dear! Yes, I suppose it does! Phoenix: (Nngh... Please, Gumshoe! Get that bridge up faster!) Elise Deauxnim Phoenix: ...I'm curious about a few things, if you don't mind answering some questions. Bikini: Oh? Do you need to know my measurements for your investigation or something? Phoenix: No, no, no! I want to know a little more about the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Bikini: ... I'm afraid I don't know her waist size. Or her bust size for that matter. Phoenix: No, no. I'm wondering why she came to stay in a place like this to begin with. I mean, she told us herself that she wasn't here for spiritual training. Bikini: My my my... You make it sound like this place is some sort of dump, Mr. Wright. Mystic Elise was here to soak up the natural beauty of Eagle Mountain, if you must know. Phoenix: There. You did it again... Sister Bikini... I noticed you always refer to Ms. Deauxnim as \"Mystic Elise\". Bikini: ...Oh!? Phoenix: Yes. Now, why is that? After all, she's not here as an acolyte... Bikini: W-We address all our visitors as \"Mystic\". It makes their experience feel authentic. A-And anyway... She's older than me. You must respect your elders, you know. Phoenix: How do you know that? How can you say for sure that she's older than you? Bikini: ... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Hmm... It seems Ms. Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor after all... And there's Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the evening of the murder, and now she's vanished. It's all got to be connected somehow...) Elise Deauxnim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me, Sister Bikini... What kind of person was Ms. Deauxnim? I mean, you call her \"Mystic Elise\" even though she wasn't here for training. Bikini: ... Phoenix: Does she have some special connection with Hazakura Temple that I'm not aware of? 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Bikini: I'm terribly sorry, but... I just can't talk about it. Phoenix: ... (Hmm... There's a nasty feeling building in the pit of my stomach... Looks like I'm going to have to break this Psyche-Lock and find out the truth.) Pearl (appears after \"Elise Deauxnim\") Phoenix: Wh-Why did Pearls have to get mixed up in this mess!? Bikini: Please, Mr. Wright! I know you're worried, but try to keep it together! Phoenix: (Oh, man... My head's throbbing so bad, it's killing me!) Pearls... She was with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder, remember? Bikini: Yes, but... I have a temple to run, you know. I was busy preparing for the training... I didn't see the little darling even once after we'd finished eating dinner. Phoenix: (The murder... It didn't take place right in front of her innocent eyes, did it...?) Bikini: According to the detective, she hasn't turned up at her home, either. Phoenix: (Come on! Keep calm! There's one place left where Pearls could be! She just has to be there! Come on, Gumshoe! Tell me you'll be done with the repairs soon! (Changed from [Gumshoe... I'm counting on you to check it out for me, so please hurry the repairs up!] in the original release)) Present \"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue Phoenix: Um, about this picture... Bikini: Oh, that old thing! I always turned those reporter-types away in the past. But Iris was so insistent this time. Phoenix: Iris? Bikini: Oh, yes! Iris loves to be the center of attention, you know. Phoenix: (Really? I find that kinda hard to believe...) Hanging Scroll Bikini: Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey! Phoenix: (So this woman is Maya's mother, huh...) Bikini: It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty disappeared. Apparently, she intended to pass the torch on to her daughter. Phoenix: Her daughter? Don't you know who her daughter is? Bikini: Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to that kind of information when it concerns the main family... Phoenix: (Hmm, Bikini doesn't seem to know Maya's standing within the Fey family...) Iris's Hood Bikini: Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection. Phoenix: Iris gave this to me on the night of the murder. But then I went and fell into the river and got this nasty fever... I thought maybe if I were to wear this hood, it'd make my fever go down faster! Bikini: ... I don't think so. Colds and spirit power have nothing to do with each other. Phoenix: (Way to crush a man's hope.) Shichishito Bikini: Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. I mean, Iris could never do such a wicked thing. Phoenix: But they proved it in court today, didn't they? That this sword wasn't the murder weapon. Bikini: That's what they were saying, yes. Phoenix: (The problem is, I saw it, too... I'm sure that what I saw was this blade stabbed into Ms. Deauxnim's body.) Victim's Staff Bikini: Ah, it's Mystic Elise's staff. Hmm... The crystal sphere really is missing from it. Phoenix: But the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, right? Bikini: Yes. Even though I'm sure Mystic Elise was in Hazakura Temple that entire evening. Tracks Photo Phoenix: About this photograph... Bikini: Oh, yes. Those are our snowmobile's tracks, alright. I'd know them anywhere! Phoenix: (But there's only one set... Which means... ...the rider went out while it was still snowing, and came back after it had stopped. That's really the only logical explanation, I suppose.) Larry's Sketch Bikini: Honestly! It's like the end of the world. Phoenix: It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Bikini: To think people have the gall to call this kind of scribbling by the name of art! Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: If that's the sort of standard you need for the arts these days, I could be a pop diva! Phoenix: Um, sure. But what about the contents of the picture? What do you make of that? Bikini: ... It's definitely the end of the world. Crystal Sphere Bikini: This crystal sphere... It's not from a Demon-Warding Hood, but I would guess it serves a similar purpose. Phoenix: If it's not from a hood, then I guess it really is from Ms. Deauxnim's staff. Bikini: Look at the blood on it. Oh, poor Mystic Elise... Maya Fey profile Bikini: She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte! Phoenix: She is? Do you know her or something? Bikini: The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed. Phoenix: (Looks like Bikini is in the dark. She doesn't seem to know that Maya is the daughter of the Master of Kurain.) Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Oh dear. I wonder where on Earth this little girl has wandered off to? She's nowhere near the Main Hall. That's for sure. Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Bikini profile Bikini: It's all my fault, isn't it? It's all my achy back's fault. Now Mystic Elise is dead, and an acolyte is trapped inside the Inner Temple... ...and that poor little girl has gone missing, too. Phoenix: (\"Missing\"...? I hope that's all it is...) Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear. I've got to train to withstand more pain, don't I...? Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (So I was right... Ms. Deauxnim wasn't just any ol' visitor here...) Iris profile Bikini: Please, tell me! What's going to happen to poor Iris!? If she was to be found guilty, I'd... Well, I wouldn't accept it! Phoenix: But your testimony, Sister Bikini... Bikini: ... I can't help my testimony! I saw what I saw! It's up to a pro lawyer like you to deal with problems like that! Laurice Deauxnim profile Bikini: What a disgraceful young man! Phoenix: You've finally seen through him, huh... Bikini: How could he sit there and claim he really saw what he drew in that picture? Although, the portrait he did of me was rather flattering, I must say. Phoenix: (Still... It's not like Larry to make something up that might get a woman he likes in trouble. There's more to that sketch of his than meets the eye. I'm sure of it.) Franziska von Karma profile Bikini: You certainly have some unusual friends, don't you, Mr. Wright! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: F-Friends...? Bikini: That fancy-pansy painter is one thing, but whipping the judge is just bad form. Phoenix: Well... Um... Do you think you could go drill that into her head for me...? Please? Miles Edgeworth profile Bikini: You must be very happy to have such a fine mentor. Phoenix: Mentor...? No, he's just a friend... Bikini: Oh, you naughty devil! Always the joker, aren't you? Ho ho ho ho! Ah, he seemed like a lovely young man... Like the kind you can always count on. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... (It's kinda depressing how much faith she has in him...) Anything else Phoenix: I was wondering about this... Bikini: Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"! Phoenix: (I'm guessing she makes an exception for fine dining...) February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard Phoenix: (This is where Sister Bikini witnessed the incident. It's hard to imagine she was lying on the stand, so... ...maybe there are some clues that have yet to be found.) Examine Lantern Phoenix: There are a few of these stone lanterns scattered around in this courtyard. Without the city glare to compete with, I imagine they would seem a lot brighter. I guess Sister Bikini must light them now, since Iris can't be here. Staff Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim's staff... I definitely remember there being a crystal sphere attached to the staff. I guess Larry eventually found the sphere near the foot of Dusky Bridge, but... ...what was it doing all the way out there...? Ami Fey statue Phoenix: The Shichishito. It's there in Mystic Ami's right hand. But it was proven in court today that it wasn't the murder weapon. Given the design, it must've been used for some pretty gruesome things in the past... Stone wall Phoenix: The Main Gate's on the other side of that stone wall. The difference in elevation is almost 10 feet. That's how steep this hillside is! And that's also the height the body fell from, according to the autopsy. Is it possible that Ms. Deauxnim was pushed from the top of the wall...? Top right corner Phoenix: That building up there is the Main Hall. It was where we were staying. It sits kind of funny because it was built on a very steep slope. If you enter from the Main Gate side, these rooms above me are on the ground floor. Apparently, Ms. Deauxnim was staying in the corner room. I guess that's where she was pushed from that night... Ski, ski poles, or sled Phoenix: They get quite a bit of snow up here on Eagle Mountain. Around here, skis aren't just for fun. They're tools for getting around. But the sled... Now that's gotta be for Bikini's own personal entertainment! Main Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing \"Inner Temple\" and \"Pearl\" Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and visiting Courtyard) ???: Heeeeeeeeeey! Bikini: Wh-What was that jarring, inconsiderately loud yell...? Gumshoe: So this is where you've been! Keeping nice and warm, I see! Phoenix: Detective! H-Have you finished repair-- Gumshoe: The bridge!? Yeah, I did! I told you I'd let you know! Bikini: Well well well! Then I'll come along with you and... Gumshoe: Sorry, ma'am! No unauthorized entry. Access is restricted to people involved in the case. Bikini: What was that!? I'm involved, aren't I? You couldn't get much more involved than me! Gumshoe: Well yeah, but that's not what I mea-- Aaah! von Karma: It's been a while, Scruffy... Gumshoe: I-It's...! (Changed from [Y-You're...!] in the original release) Ms. v-v-v-v-v-v-Von Karmaaaaaaah! von Karma: Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me. Bikini: My my my. Well, you certainly seem to have everything under control! von Karma: I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to. Phoenix: (...As you work to pin the guilt on Iris.) von Karma: What are you daydreaming about, Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: OWW! That hurts, you know! von Karma: Silence! I, Franziska von Karma, will personally guide you through your investigation. So you will follow me! Phoenix: (...She's not seriously going to follow me around, is she...?) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: Things have certainly become a lot more hectic than before. (Changed from [Things have certainly become a lot livelier than before.] in the original release) von Karma: They must have commenced with the investigation. ???: Oh! ...Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (Th-That voice...) Pearls! Pearl: ...Mr. Nick... Mr. Niiick! Phoenix: So you were here... ever since that night... Pearl: I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone. Phoenix: (She was all alone...?) von Karma: It must have been very trying for you, little girl. Pearl: Ah! You're... von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here. Pearl: You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year. von Karma: Well... Pearl: I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip! von Karma: ...! Pearl: Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you! von Karma: I... I...! Phoenix: (It looks like Pearls's words are getting under her skin...) von Karma: ............ Phoenix: Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything! von Karma: You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away! Phoenix: A-Anyway... Pearls...? Weren't you with Maya? Pearl: Ah! ... I'm sorry! It's... It's all my fault! Phoenix: Huh!? What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: I... I... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Pearls! (She just ran off!) Oww! von Karma: That was cruel, Phoenix Wright. To make a little girl cry like that is inexcusable! Phoenix: (What was that all about? Pearls acting like that... It's giving me the creeps. I guess I'd better take another look around since I've finally got a chance! Especially since something about this place seems different from two days ago.) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here. It's an unusually long bridge, isn't it? von Karma: I would say it's about 20 yards. Phoenix: I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire, huh? von Karma: Therefore, no one has crossed the gorge in either direction since the night of the murder. A simple, yet sound deduction, wouldn't you say, Phoenix Wright? Hook von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: What!? And would you stop calling me by my full name like that? von Karma: Was this once a prosperous port? Phoenix: A port...? von Karma: Yes. That metal hook is a mooring post for boats, you know. Phoenix: Oh, that. That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I think the wire that was tied to this one probably snapped when the bridge burned down. (I mean, there's no way there was ever a port all the way up here...) von Karma: Don't get smart with me, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: But I didn't say anything! Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. von Karma: Phoenix Wright... Do you think this is how many siblings the head nun has? Phoenix: ... Why don't you ask her the next time you see her? von Karma: ...You know what? I think I will. Phoenix: (And she'll probably slap you for prying into her private affairs.) Incinerator Phoenix: (There's a weird smell coming from that incinerator. The door is also open, almost like it's begging me to look inside...) Well, well. Let's see what stunning clue is concealed in here, shall we?  ... Huh? It's empty! von Karma: How na\u00efve of you, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: But it's a bit strange, don't you think? ...Franziska von Karma? (I seem to remember... ...there was snow on this incinerator the first time I saw it. In other words, someone's been using it to burn something recently...) von Karma: Listen, Phoenix Wright! It's impertinent to call people by their full name! Phoenix: I was only copying you. Yellow gate Phoenix: There's a little gate that leads into the garden. It says \"No Entry\" on the sign, though. von Karma: Come now, Phoenix Wright! What are you doing? Let's go in. It's half open anyway. What harm could come of it? Phoenix: But it says, \"No Entry\". von Karma: ... Don't you Americans enjoy doing whatever you like and then simply say, \"Whatever!?\" Phoenix: That's got nothing to do with anything! (And who told you that!?) Wooden log Phoenix: The sign says \"Inner Temple\". von Karma: I don't know how you're reading it, but it's illegible to me. Phoenix: Actually, I can't read it either. von Karma: Feigning comprehension isn't a very good habit to have, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (She looks really happy to have finally caught me on something...) Gate von Karma: This must be the door that leads to the Inner Temple. Where Maya Fey was training on the night of the murder... Phoenix: Yes. There's a solitary room there called the Training Hall. von Karma: You could do with some training yourself, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: ... YEOWWW! von Karma: You're completely out of shape. Phoenix: (Nngh... I don't know how much more of this woman I can take!) February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: ... von Karma: What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Phoenix: Maya... She was supposed to be in here training. von Karma: Yet, it appears she's nowhere to be seen. Phoenix: ... (What's that...? That strange lock...? It wasn't there two days ago. This whole room is really giving off some strange vibes...) Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's full of nothing but old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Mattresses Phoenix: Look at those wafer-thin mattresses! von Karma: I'm sorry, Phoenix Wright... \"Wafer-thin\"? Phoenix: Yeah, you know. Thin like a wafer. In other words uncomfortable. That's how we describe things like these mattresses. I guess you must say, \"wafer-thick\" or something back in Germany? von Karma: Not about these mattresses. Certainly not! Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here two days ago, that weird lock wasn't on it. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen a lock quite like this before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like this before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if this lock is guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Hanging scroll von Karma: What do you think this yellowish poster is, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: It's a scroll, not a poster. It's a picture of a woman who's actually... ... von Karma: A woman? I don't see any woman here. Phoenix: (There's a different atmosphere in this room since the last time I was here. No... It's not a different atmosphere, it's a different smell! ([smell] highlighted in the original release)) It's gravy! von Karma: ...What's the matter? Phoenix: This scroll... It's been completely covered in gravy! von Karma: Ah. Yes. There is a very appetizing smell in the air. But gravy is a type of sauce. So when you run out of paint, you Americans use gravy as a substitute, I see. Phoenix: No! No one does that! For starters, it stinks! (This must be the gravy that we had with the roast on the night of the incident. But why would anyone do this? Why this scroll?) Hanging Scroll updated. Touch to see before and after view under the Check screen. Hanging scroll (subsequent times) Phoenix: (This scroll shows a picture of Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. But why would anyone cover it in gravy?) von Karma: I can't make out what's drawn on this scroll at all. I'll never understand you Americans and your so-called artists... Phoenix: (Artists? Um, yeah...) After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll: ???: What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite. Phoenix: P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here. von Karma: Prosecutor? Phoenix: How come you didn't show up at the trial today? Godot: Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question. Phoenix: Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so... Godot: I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding. von Karma: Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial? Godot: ... Who's the wild mare, Trite? Phoenix: This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today. Godot: Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins. von Karma: Just who do you think you are!? This case is my... Godot: Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home! von Karma: ... Phoeeenix Wriiight! Phoenix: Wh-What are you hitting me for!? Godot: Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Godot: You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo. Phoenix: (There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?) Talk Why didn't you show? Phoenix: You had some important business and that's why you weren't in court, huh? So what was it? Godot: ... I've told you once before, but perhaps you don't remember. Godot: I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you. Godot: You see, Trite... I've experienced something most have not. Death. Phoenix: You... died? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: So... you mean... That mask you wear is...? Godot: This ugly device? I promise it's not a fashion statement, my unenlightened friend. Without this, I can't see your frequently dumbfounded face. Phoenix: I... I didn't know... Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything. Still, I keep this worn-out piece of junk of a body going with regular servicing. von Karma: I'm sorry, but... ...you say you experienced death? How is that possible? What happened...? Godot: ... Why don't you ask him? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me!? Godot: Yeah, Trite. You. You should know all about it. You know when my life ended... And who ended it for me. von Karma: W-Well, Phoenix Wright! Do you!? Phoenix: I-I don't know what he's talking about... (Although... To be honest... I do feel a little tug at the corner of my memory... I think I do know about how Godot was \"killed\"...) Godot: It will all become clear in due time. Isn't that right, Trite? Can't undo? Phoenix: Earlier, you said I've done something I can never undo. What did you mean by that exactly? Godot: ... The Inner Temple here on this side of Dusky Bridge is an isolated island. Phoenix: (That's what Sister Bikini said, too.) Godot: And I wonder, Trite... Do you know what the police are doing here today? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Godot: They're searching... Searching for any trace of an acolyte who went missing. Phoenix: M-Missing? Godot: As leader of the search party, I can tell you this with absolute certainty... Maya Fey is not on this side of Dusky Bridge. Phoenix: Huh? B-But that's impossible! She came here that night and... Godot: I won't say it again. The chances of her being here are nil. Excluding of course, one very unique place... Phoenix: (One? Where is that?) Godot: The Sacred Cavern, the entrance of which we are standing at right now. This is the only place that the search party has yet to explore. Phoenix: (So they haven't searched that cavern yet, huh...) Godot: Be aware, though, that the temperature inside frequently falls below freezing. Even if she were in there... (Changed from [Even if she was in there...] in the original release) ...the chances of her being found alive are slim at best. Phoenix: N-No! Godot: Which means, Trite, that you sent Maya Fey to her death! von Karma: You fool! If that's the situation, why aren't you in there with a search party right now!? Godot: You must have blinders on, my equestrian angel. Don't you see the big lock and chains? It's a trick lock. I'm making preparations to open it as we speak. Well, Trite? Once again, a woman dies because of you. Phoenix: \"Once again\"!? What are you talking about? Godot: Don't tell me you've forgotten...? It was only two years ago, after all... ...when the last unfortunate woman died because of you. Phoenix: (Because of me...?) Godot: And do you know who that was? It was Maya Fey's sister! That's right! Mia Fey! Phoenix: M-Mia!? Godot: You killed her! Phoenix: N-No, that's not how it was! Mia Fey (appears after \"Can't undo?\") Godot: It was two years ago... Mia Fey was pursuing someone. A man. But she bit off more than she could chew. She made a very dangerous enemy. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's one case I'll never forget.) But... I got that guy! Personally! Godot: Sure. Ms. Fey's murderer was caught. But that won't bring her back! Phoenix: W-Well, no... but... Godot: You were with her at the time. You and no one else. It was your responsibility! You should have protected her! Phoenix: I...! Godot: You say Mia Fey was your teacher! Well then, I'd say you've learned nothing, Trite! You robbed her of her life. And now... ...you've let her sister suffer the same fate! Phoenix: (I... I haven't sentenced Maya to death...! No...!) Trick lock (appears after \"Can't undo?\") von Karma: What is this peculiar-looking lock? Why don't we just break it open? It would be a simple matter of... Godot: I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past. von Karma: Very well. Then dare I suggest the obvious solution of opening it with the key? Godot: Ha...! Sure. Just show me where the keyhole is on this trick lock. Phoenix: Th-There's no keyhole!? Godot: That's right. An interesting puzzle, huh? The person who set this lock is the only one who can open it. Phoenix: Then who was it!? Godot: Simple. The accused. Phoenix: What? Iris? Godot: When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there. Phoenix: (Sister Bikini did mention it a number of times, now that I think about it. She said that Iris was left in charge of supervising the early stages of the training.) Godot: So Iris, the accused, is the only one who can open this lock. I've arranged for her to be brought here now. Phoenix: (Iris is the only person who can open this lock...? I hope she gets here soon! ...Hang on in there, Maya. We'll get you out!) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Godot... Would you mind taking a look at this? Godot: Ha...! My eyes have a date with the horizon. They're flirting with the gulls. I don't have any intention of aiding a defense attorney like you, Trite. von Karma: But you must help him! Even just a little! Phoenix: (Look who's talking!) von Karma: I had no idea such a smooth refusal could make me so angry! After clearing all Talk options: Godot: ... So. I should be getting back to work. Phoenix: Wait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you? Godot: ... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be. Phoenix: ... Godot: You'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon. Phoenix: (Edgeworth?) Godot: Listen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never. Phoenix: ...! von Karma: You should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: That's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.) Inner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall) ???: ... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...? Phoenix: (Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?) Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah! von Karma: Is something troubling you, Scruffy? Gumshoe: P-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir! von Karma: It was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip. Phoenix: So what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, pal!? von Karma: Perhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...? Gumshoe: H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK? Phoenix: Um... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it? Gumshoe: ... I... um... kinda already snuck in there! Phoenix: (Is he trying to be clever or something...?) von Karma: So what's behind there, Scruffy? Gumshoe: Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden. Phoenix: A garden? Gumshoe: Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me? Phoenix: (Isn't it normally the other way around?) Gumshoe: Well, see you later! von Karma: So... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!) February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: ... von Karma: There's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is... Phoenix: (Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?) Gumshoe: Aaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here! von Karma: Don't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here. Gumshoe: B-But... Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... von Karma: It is certainly a quaint little garden. Oh! What is this huge bowl here for? Gumshoe: Oh, I know this one! It's... um... It's a ...water bowl, isn't it? von Karma: Everything else is completely frozen over... But the ice in this bowl has been broken. Phoenix: That's true... (I wonder if this has any impact on the case...?) Gumshoe: Umm... Well... I, uh... I doused my face earlier with the water in this. I was getting kinda sleepy... Gaaargh! von Karma: Next time you're sleepy, you need only come to me! Got it!? Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Kurain Master's Talisman added to the Court Record. Charm (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Gumshoe: Apparently, it belonged to the victim. von Karma: To Ms. Elise Deauxnim? Gumshoe: Yeah. There was a broken leather cord around the lady's neck. The ends of the cords found on both the victim and on this charm match exactly. Phoenix: (Sounds to me like... (Changed from [This means that this charm definitely belonged to Ms. Deauxnim.] in the original release) ...this little trinket is going to be my ticket to getting some very big answers! (Changed from [This could be a really vital piece of evidence.] in the original release)) Torches Phoenix: There are a couple of torches here. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Gumshoe: Yeah. I was looking at those things, pal. It looks like they've been lit pretty recently. von Karma: Recently? How recent are we talking about? Gumshoe: As recent as the night of the murder... Phoenix: (Maya was training here on the night of the murder... It's not unreasonable to think these things were lit up at the time, I guess.) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: ...Well, this is odd. There's no snow on the ground here. And it's an almost perfect rectangle. It couldn't have happened naturally. von Karma: Yes. It appears as though someone has carefully cleared away the snow. No doubt it was you, wasn't it, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: Huh? No, it wasn't me, sir! It was already like that when my men and I got here to start the investigation. Phoenix: (If it wasn't the police, then who did it...?) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Just between the three of us, OK? von Karma: What is it? Gumshoe: It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it? von Karma: ...Understood. Gumshoe: Well, when I was a kid, I got knocked out of the local wrestling contest, you see. I was so disappointed, I just picked up my mouth guard and cried all the way home. Man, I got in so much trouble when I left it on the couch! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: ... von Karma: ...Is that it? Gumshoe: That's it. Gaaargh! Phoenix: (Whoever cleared the snow away must have had a reason... Although I can't even begin to imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Phoenix: What the heck is that!? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... You spotted it, huh, pal? Phoenix: Are you kidding me!? It couldn't be more obvious! von Karma: It says... \"Maya\"... Gumshoe: Yeah. And before you ask, it's written in blood... von Karma: You will answer all our questions now, Scruffy! Without exception! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the Inner Temple investigation going...? Gumshoe: We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place! von Karma: Forensic team? And what was the outcome of this scientific study? Gumshoe: Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle. von Karma: ... That's simply not good enough, Scruffy! Do you think I'll let you get away with that? Gumshoe: Uh-oh... Well, there were a couple of things that bothered me when I first got here, sir... von Karma: That stone lantern, and the surrounding area that's not covered in snow, correct? Gumshoe: They looked kinda fishy to me. You know, scientifically speaking. So I got the lab boys to look them over. The results were... It's kinda hard to say, actually. Phoenix: (I guess I better look into them myself.) Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Oh... Um... Did Mr. Godot tell you yet? Phoenix: ...Yes, we heard. Gumshoe: He's got a search party out looking for her. But there's nowhere else she could have disappeared to on this side of Dusky Bridge. All we can do is wait for Mr. Edgeworth to get here, pal. Phoenix: Edgeworth? Gumshoe: He's escorting Iris, the defendant, over here. von Karma: We'll have to wait, since she is the only one who can open the door to the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: Oh! I think Mr. Edgeworth wants to talk to you about something too, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? I wonder what it is... Gumshoe: Just don't be expecting any good news when you talk to him. When I spoke to him, Mr. Edgeworth sounded so down, I felt like I was drowning... Phoenix: (Sounds... pleasant...) Bloody writing (appears after examining stone lantern) Phoenix: \"Maya\"... So these letters are written in blood? Gumshoe: Yeah... What's worse is it's the victim's blood. Phoenix: Huh!? This is Ms. Deauxnim's blood? Gumshoe: We haven't done a detailed analysis yet, but... it's looking that way, pal. von Karma: Hmm... Most interesting... Phoenix Wright. I presume you know, don't you. Why Maya's name is written upside-down. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: You know what, that was really bothering me, too. But I just came up with the answer. The result of my own special Gumshoe Investigation! von Karma: Really? Do tell... Gumshoe: Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was upside-down! von Karma: Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. Ms. Elise Deauxnim wrote these letters herself, in her own blood. Phoenix: Y-You must be joking! (That's impossible!) Gumshoe: From the writing in the victim's blood and the other clues left behind... ...it seems pretty likely that this garden was the scene of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. At least, that's our current theory on how the events took place, pal. Phoenix: Whaaaaat!? True crime scene (appears after \"Bloody writing\") Phoenix: So Ms. Deauxnim was killed here...? Gumshoe: However you wanna look at it, that's what people are saying now. Phoenix: Then... what Sister Bikini saw in the courtyard at the main temple was... Well, what was it!? If that wasn't the scene of the crime, what did she see? Gumshoe: ... What do you think, Ms. von Karmaaaaa!? von Karma: Surely a special Gumshoe Investigation would reveal the answer, no? Phoenix: But wait a sec. The bloody writing and all the other clues here... Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder, right? (Changed from [Someone could've easily set all that up after the murder had taken place, right?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Sorry, but that's not an option, pal. Phoenix: Why not!? von Karma: How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely inaccessible... ...because Dusky Bridge was completely burned out. Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: I was overseeing repairs to the bridge the whole time. No one came over here before me and my men. Which means no one could've planted all this stuff here, pal. Phoenix: Nngh...! (I-I can't think of a counterargument to that...) Gumshoe: I knew it... I should've washed the blood off the lantern as soon as I got here. Phoenix: (If this really was the scene of the crime... ...then I need to figure out exactly what it was that Bikini actually saw!) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Magatama Gumshoe: Hey, that looks good. Is it a cough drop? I tell you, pal. I've had a sore throat all day. Phoenix: Ack! No! That's my Magatama! You can't eat it! Gumshoe: Oh... Phoenix: (At least he doesn't just put stuff in his mouth first and ask questions later anymore.) Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. I really love that stuff. I eat it so much that my coat even smel-- Aaah! von Karma: Have you nothing else to say about this than your inane ramblings about gravy!? Gumshoe: ... N-Not really. Phoenix: ...Let's leave it at that, OK? Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. von Karma: Still, it strikes me as odd... Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous become an author? Gumshoe: You know what probably happened? I bet she didn't know her books were gonna be such a success. That's what I think. Shichishito Gumshoe: I didn't follow the ins and outs of it, but... ...it turned out that this wasn't the murder weapon, right? Phoenix: If what Sister Bikini saw is right, then no, it's not. She said the murder weapon was thrust into the victim up to the hilt. But the blood stains on this aren't consistent with her story. Gumshoe: Don't worry, pal! I'll uncover the real murder weapon. If I haven't turned it up by Spring, you can take my badge! Phoenix: (The case will be long over by then, Gumshoe!) Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? von Karma: Is it going to have anything to do with the case, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, no. But it's really... von Karma: Then I'm not interested. Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Crime Photo Phoenix: What do you make of this photo of the crime scene...? Gumshoe: It's really gruesome... All I gotta say is that the killer is messed up in the head. But it turns out that Shichishito thing wasn't even the murder weapon. So then, why would someone stab it in the victim like that? Phoenix: (That's the mystery we're here to solve...) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. von Karma: At the risk of repeating myself... ...you really ought to choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: OK, I know Larry's a bit out there... ...but he genuinely wants to help Iris. I'm sure of that. He wouldn't have produced this for no good reason. von Karma: You are nothing more than a marshmallow on the inside. The both of you. Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) von Karma: The crystal had dropped out of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff. Gumshoe: And there are traces of blood on it, too. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Kurain Master's Talisman Gumshoe: That thing must've been worn by the victim. There's no other way of looking at it. Phoenix: You mean, because of the matching leather cord found around the victim's neck? Gumshoe: Yeah. I bet it was one of those things she always wore. I've got this safe driving charm I've been wearing for over a year now. If I ever get into an accident, it guarantees it'll be the other guy's fault. Phoenix: (Isn't it supposed to stop you from having an accident in the first place?) Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: The situation hasn't changed. We still don't know anything about Maya's whereabouts. She's gotta be in the Sacred Cavern, though. That's the only place left. I heard it's real cold in there. We've gotta get her out fast, or it could be bad, pal. Phoenix: Isn't there anything you can do, Detective!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about!? Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: We're already on it! You couldn't get a faster response from a computer. Mr. Godot put everything in place right away. That guy doesn't mess around. Phoenix: G-Godot? Gumshoe: Yeah. The coffee-drinking mystery man who didn't show in court. I gotta say. He's totally made me rethink my perception of him, pal. Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Apparently, the girl was trapped over here since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. von Karma: Phoenix Wright! Look sharp and go comfort that poor young girl! Phoenix: I will... Trust me, I will... Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me I already know. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: (Hmm... Never would've expected the Prosecutor's Office to be so lax...) von Karma: Don't get the wrong impression, Phoenix Wright. More importantly... Doesn't it strike you as odd that the police are unaware of that man's medical situation? Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: Yeah. Why is he hiding that from everyone? von Karma: Additionally it raises another question... Why did he choose to tell only you? Phoenix: (Yeah. Why did he?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! von Karma: You mean, you don't have any special attachments to that coat...? And after all the effort I took to mail it back to you from Germany... Gumshoe: ... Ah, well, I'll be sure to take good care of it once it's retired, sir. Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! von Karma: For a detective, you are completely lacking in powers of observation! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. von Karma: Oh? How interesting, Scruffy. Sadly, I don't share the same sentiment. Prepare yourself well for tomorrow, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Why does every prosecutor want to burn me at the stake so badly...?) Laurice Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: He was Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice, or so I heard. Phoenix: ...Well, I suppose you could call him that. Gumshoe: The guy drew a portrait of me, you know. Phoenix: Well, lucky you, I suppose. Gumshoe: Yeah, but I had to pay him 50 cents for it. Phoenix: That's pretty awful. Gumshoe: ... You aren't really enthused about this guy either, huh...? Phoenix: Well... he made a mockery of the court today. (And I'm almost sure he did it on purpose, too...) Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: ............ Wow! What a beauty, huh? Gaargh! von Karma: What was that long pause for, Scruffy!? Gumshoe: ............ That's a real nice broach she's got, too. Gaargh! Phoenix: (Gumshoe needs to learn how to give compliments faster than Franziska gives lashes.) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... People really don't get Edgeworth, do they? von Karma: It's his own fault for not explaining anything about himself. Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. von Karma: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you shouldn't advertise, Gumshoe. Especially in front of her...) After examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate von Karma: It seems you have a visitor. Iris: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Iris! I'm really glad to see you! Edgeworth: Godot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency. von Karma: Not him again. Phoenix: Never mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern... Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later? Edgeworth: ...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys! Edgeworth: ... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position. Phoenix: What do you mean by a delicate position...? Edgeworth: ... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere. Phoenix: C-Come on, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: If anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright. Phoenix: But it's Maya! Iris: Mr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct? Phoenix: I... von Karma: Listen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright. Edgeworth: From now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us. Phoenix: ... Aaack! von Karma: This is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention? Phoenix: ... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: ... Phoenix: Sister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her... von Karma: Don't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini? Bikini: My my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Phoenix: (From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.) Bikini: Iris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince! Phoenix: (Is she talking about Edgeworth?) Bikini: It was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...? von Karma: Only what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain! Bikini: ... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see. Phoenix: Huh? Me? ...Ack! von Karma: *glare* Phoenix: O-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular! Bikini: *sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee! Phoenix: (I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.) von Karma: Do you have a problem, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release)) Talk Elise Deauxnim (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago.\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Elise Deauxnim -- Phoenix: Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her true identity. Bikini: What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books. Phoenix: To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her. Bikini: S-Suspicions? Phoenix: Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Sister Bikini!? What do you have to say to that? Bikini: Of course! I don't know why it didn't hit me before. Your heart. It's impure! It's riddled with wickedness and fallacies. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: That's why you keep coming up with these funny ideas. I recommend Mystic Elise's book, \"The Magic Bottle\", for a man in your condition. Phoenix: (\"The Magic Bottle\"...? I hope it doesn't have a child-proof cap on it...) Bikini: She was a wonderful author and illustrator... That's all! I swear! Leads back to: \"To be honest...\" Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim had this charm with her at all times. Bikini: Kaaargh! Where did you...!? Phoenix: This isn't some cheap good luck charm, either. Bikini: Th-Then... What do you think it is, Mr. Wright? Wh-What could a talisman like that possibly mean? Phoenix: It's a \"talisman\", is it? Interesting... Bikini: Oops! Phoenix: This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was. This talisman and one other item unequivocally prove Ms. Deauxnim's true identity! Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Leads to: \"The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Bikini: You really ought to think about buying one of the charms we sell here, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? Bikini: Otherwise... You just might find yourself jumped on by a little old lady on a dark mountain path! Phoenix: (What am I doing!? The piece of evidence I need to show Bikini is obvious!) Bikini: That's... That's just a plain old good luck charm. So please, just give it back! Phoenix: Oh, no! I don't think so! Leads back to: \"This thing speaks volumes about who Ms. Deauxnim really was.\" Phoenix: The painting is obscured by this gravy stain at the moment... Bikini: ...! Phoenix: But this scroll shows the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. The crest at the top is a sign of that honorable title. The very same crest that adorns the talisman the victim carried with her! Bikini: Aaaah! Phoenix: This crest is reserved for the Master of Kurain. Bikini: Who on Earth told you that nonsense!? I-I've got no idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: The new Master, Maya Fey, told me! Bikini: Wh... WHAT!? Y-You mean that acolyte... is Misty Fey's... Phoenix: Daughter? Yes. Bikini: ... Are you sure? Phoenix: Yes. In fact, since her first daughter passed away, Maya is Misty Fey's sole successor. Bikini: ... ...M... Mystic Mistyyyyyyy! 5 LOCKS BROKEN Unlock Successful Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't m-- Bikini: You there, Ms. von Karma! Time to take out that whip of yours and teach him a lesson! von Karma: With pleasure, Sister. Bad boy! You need to be taught a lesson, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Aaaaah!! Someone... Anyone... ...h...e...l...p...!) Kurain Master's Talisman Phoenix: Um, Sister Bikini. Would you mind taking a look at this? Bikini: Aaaaah! What are you doing with that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I can't! This is evidence. (This really must be one very important item...) Bikini: Mystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release) von Karma: What is the significance of this talisman, Sister? Bikini: The Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death. von Karma: Until their death...? Phoenix: So Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh... Bikini: ... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: (...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...) von Karma: Tell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...? Bikini: Because something happened that called her out of hiding. Phoenix: ...W-What happened? Bikini: Well... ... von Karma: Wh-What's happening? Phoenix: (I-It can't be...) Bikini: E-Earthquake! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaargh! Bikini: Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might... von Karma: The Inner Temple? Bikini: The Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in! Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? MAYA!!! von Karma: It... It seems to have... passed... Phoenix: Well, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go! von Karma: What? Where? Phoenix: To the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!? von Karma: ...! Phoenix: Sister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!? Bikini: Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready. von Karma: Come on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you. Phoenix: Th-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...) von Karma: You look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth? Phoenix: ... Come on. Let's go! Main Gate Phoenix: (We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...) Edgeworth: ...Wright! Phoenix: Aah! Wh-What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Gurgh... H-How could I have...? ... von Karma: How do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up! Phoenix: Yeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!? Edgeworth: Sh-She's gone... Phoenix: (N-No...!) Edgeworth: The defendant... Iris... She's... gone... von Karma: Gone where? Edgeworth: She fled... She escaped! von Karma: WHAT!? Phoenix: So... it was just now... during the... Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...) Edgeworth: I should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out! Phoenix: That incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it? Edgeworth: ... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side. von Karma: We haven't seen her. Edgeworth: Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom! Phoenix: Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross... Phoenix: No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What are you talking about? Phoenix: Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake. von Karma: Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...? Phoenix: Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary. Edgeworth: Wright... Phoenix: Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now! Edgeworth: ... Alright. Let's go! February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Phoenix: (Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.) 5 TRICK LOCKS Phoenix: H-How can there be... von Karma: ...Even more locks... Phoenix: (Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris! Iris: ... Phoenix: (Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?) To be continued. February 9Inner TempleTraining Hall Edgeworth: Wright, is this what Godot was talking about? Phoenix: ...Yeah. The trick locks. Edgeworth: Now then, Iris. Please remove these at once. Iris: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me... Edgeworth: What!? Phoenix: (During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.) von Karma: So you're saying that you can't undo the new locks? Iris: ...Yes. Edgeworth: If only I was stronger...! Phoenix: Edgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face. Edgeworth: Like you're one to talk with your face all green. von Karma: ...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself. Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh! von Karma: There's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here. Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden... von Karma: Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles. Phoenix: ...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris? Iris: No, not at all... Examine Drawers Phoenix: It's an antique dresser. von Karma: Don't you dare open it, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her not to touch things...) von Karma: ... What a pity. It's just full of old clothes for the acolytes. Phoenix: I thought we weren't opening it! von Karma: I'm from the Prosecutor's Office. I can do anything. Phoenix: (Yeah, you can do anything... Except stand up to a 9 year old girl.) Sacred cavern entrance Phoenix: Hmm... This door... When I was here earlier, there was only one lock, but now there's five of them. von Karma: Those chains... It's almost as if they're guarding something inside that cavern. I've never seen locks quite like these before. Phoenix: (I have. I've seen locks and chains just like these before. They look just like the ones that guard a person's secrets during a Psyche-Lock. I wonder if these locks are guarding something, too. Dark secrets in a dark cavern...) Talk Escape Phoenix: Why did you make a run for it, Iris? Iris: I... I'm sorry. I heard the Inner Temple had been severely shaken by the strong earthquake we had. I... I was so worried. I just had to come and see. von Karma: In other words, you didn't run away to escape the law. At least we're clear on that. Iris: I can't tell you how relieved I was when I saw the Sacred Cavern was alright, but... von Karma: But what? Iris: Then I saw these chains here. I saw all these extra locks that someone had put on the Sacred Cavern's door, and... von Karma: Hmm... Iris: Who in the world would've done something like this? Trick lock Iris: These trick locks are a sacred treasure of the Kurain Tradition. There are hundreds of ways to set them. That's why only the person who set the lock can open it. von Karma: And you aren't the one who set these locks? Phoenix: I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was only one lock. But now, somehow, there's five of them... Iris: What does that mean? Phoenix: It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The first one. Iris: ... Yes... That's correct. von Karma: What? Phoenix: Iris! Try to think, please! Isn't there any way around this? Iris: ... Well, like I said, there are hundreds of different ways to set these locks. I suppose if I went through every combination with each one, I could remove them. But... von Karma: It will take time, won't it? Iris: Yes. About a day, if I had to guess. Phoenix: (A whole day!?) von Karma: Well, that's better than leaving the locks in place. Will you do this for us? Iris: Sure. I'll do whatever I can. Phoenix: (We've got to wait another day? Hang in there, Maya. You're going to have to call on your inner strength now.) The night of the crime Phoenix: You know what, Iris... There's still one thing I don't quite get. von Karma: And what might that be, Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: I think it's obvious. Iris, on the night of the murder, where were you? Iris: ...? Phoenix: Please, Iris! Don't give me that look! You told us that you were in your room at Hazakura Temple at the time of the incident. But you were seen that same evening at the Inner Temple. And then, you were spotted at the scene of the crime in Hazakura Temple, too. von Karma: Being spotted at both Hazakura Temple and the Inner Temple; it's as if you were... Phoenix: Well, Iris? I think it's about time you told us the truth. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it. There's something going on here that we don't know about.) Iris: ... The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: On the night of the murder, you were spotted in two very different locations: In Hazakura Temple's courtyard, and in the Training Hall at the Inner Temple. Iris: ... Phoenix: And yet you claim that you were in your room the entire time. I'm sorry, Iris, but I don't buy your story. It's time you told me the truth! Iris: ... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Truthfully, there's one other thing that's been bothering me. If I can just break this Psyche-Lock... ...I might be able to answer that question as well.) Present Anything Phoenix: Could you take a look at this for me, Iris? Yeow! von Karma: The locks are far more important at this moment, wouldn't you agree!? Phoenix: (She's right... I'm going to have to hold off on asking her about things for now.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. February 9Inner TempleGarden Phoenix: The cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time. Edgeworth: *mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...? Phoenix: (Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...? Edgeworth: Aaaah! ... Phoenix: ... Hey! Don't you dare run away! Edgeworth: ...What do you want, Wright? Phoenix: What do I want? Edgeworth: If you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away! Phoenix: (*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris. Edgeworth: Y-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible. Examine Bottom left area Phoenix: A little lantern, a little statue... It's small, but the whole place is incredibly well-kept. Edgeworth: There's just one thing that's troubling me. Everything else is covered in snow or frozen over... ...but the ice in this bowl has been broken by someone. Phoenix: ... Maybe one of the detectives washed their face in it or something? Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous, Wright! No detective would be that careless at a crime scene! Phoenix: (He's really angry... I'd better not say it was Gumshoe or his salary's gonna pay...) Charm Phoenix: There's a charm or something poking out from the snow. (It looks pretty old. There's a leather cord tied to it, too.) Edgeworth: It belonged to the victim. We're sure of that now. It's going in the evidence room once the investigation is over, so hands off, Wright. Phoenix: You don't need to tell me that! Edgeworth: Well, our dear friend Larry just tried to steal it when no one was looking. Phoenix: (He probably just wanted something to remember his esteemed teacher by...) Torches Phoenix: There are torches of the naked flame variety. I guess you need all the light you can get up here in the mountains. Edgeworth: Accordingly to Detective Gumshoe, they were lit on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Well, Maya was training up here, so there's nothing strange about that. Edgeworth: Except... Apparently, they don't light these torches for training sessions. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: I heard that too much light isn't conducive to spiritual training. Phoenix: (Oh... I didn't know that...) Ground around stone lantern Phoenix: Why's this the only area with no snow? Edgeworth: Someone must have cleared it away. What other explanation is there? Of course, I played the \"What If?\" game as well... But when I asked our trusty bungler, Detective Gumshoe, he said it wasn't him. Phoenix: (I suppose Edgeworth has a point... Whoever cleared the snow away must've had a reason to do so. I just can't imagine what that reason could be.) Stone lantern Edgeworth: I suppose you've noticed that Maya's name is written on this lantern. Phoenix: It's pretty hard to miss, you know. Edgeworth: It's written in Ms. Deauxnim's blood. She was probably forced up against the lantern by the killer. Then with her back against the lantern, she wrote that name with her finger. That's why it's written upside-down. Phoenix: You think the victim wrote this herself? Edgeworth: Isn't that the obvious conclusion? Phoenix: But why would she write Maya's name? Edgeworth: ... I don't think that's something I want to discuss with you. Talk The investigation Phoenix: You guys are putting a lot of effort into the investigation of the garden here, huh... Edgeworth: There's a high chance this is the actual scene of the crime. That's why. Phoenix: You mean because of the writing in blood and the talisman in the snow? Edgeworth: Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder. Phoenix: But surely... you don't suspect... ...Maya, do you? Edgeworth: ... We have to treat everyone as a suspect - Maya, as well as Iris. It's our job, Wright. Earthquakes Phoenix: So... I guess you still haven't gotten over your fear of earthquakes... Edgeworth: No... Though, thankfully, my nightmares have stopped. (Changed from [No... Thankfully, my nightmares have stopped.] in the original release) But still, if the ground gives even the slightest tremor, I find myself short of breath. Phoenix: (...17 years ago... when we were little school kids at the same elementary school... Edgeworth found himself in the middle of a murder...) It all started with that big quake that hit the courthouse... Edgeworth: Yes. I was stuck in the elevator with my father, who was a defense lawyer. We were deprived of oxygen and we passed out. That's when it happened. That single gunshot... shattered my whole life... I lost everything that day... All because of that earthquake. My dreams, my family... and myself. Phoenix: ... It's been more than 17 years now... And that case was finally resolved 2 years ago, right? (Changed from [And that case was finally resolved 3 years ago, right?] in the original release) Edgeworth: You think I don't know that!? I was there! But... It was such a shock. I never imagined I could be so wrong about myself and my life... I'm sorry, Wright... There's nothing else I can say. Not after you chose to become a lawyer for my sake... And not after you saved me... Phoenix: (Edgeworth... You're stronger than you think, so no more of this self-pity, OK...?) Iris Edgeworth: There was something that bothered me about her from the moment we met. I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before. No... Wait... Not \"somewhere\"... I felt like I'd seen her in court before. Phoenix: So you went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look for her file? Edgeworth: Yes. I checked over every case file I've ever worked on. And I was right. I had seen her face before, six years ago. Phoenix: Six years ago...? Edgeworth: It was my first appearance in court, and as cases go, it was my worse [sic] nightmare. Phoenix: So!? Who is she...? Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry, Wright. I can't give that information away to a member of the general public. Phoenix: What!? Why not? It might be the crucial piece of the puzzle that solves this case. Edgeworth: The woman I knew was the daughter of a jewelry store owner. She had nothing to do with Iris and Hazakura Temple. And neither did the case. No, that woman is completely unrelated to this murder. Phoenix: Unrelated? Edgeworth: Yes. I can say that with complete confidence. Phoenix: (You're wrong, Edgeworth! She's totally related to this case! I need to fill Edgeworth in. I need to explain the connection between Iris and the woman Edgeworth knew.) Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Is that your attorney's badge? Interesting. I never imagined I'd ever see you wearing one of these, Wright. Phoenix: It's because of you that I became one, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Not that I have any regrets. I really don't. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (If you're trying to say \"thanks\", you can start by saying it a bit louder...) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Another victim we know nothing about. Same as always. I hope you'll tell me if you know something about our mystery woman, Wright. Phoenix: (I know that Elise Deauxnim was no ordinary visitor to the temple. But her true identity could be a useful weapon for the defense. And I can't give that away just like that...) Iris's Hood Edgeworth: Iris gave that to you, didn't she? Phoenix: Yes, and it really works! It helped my fever go down quicker. I'm sure of it. Edgeworth: So you say! But your face is as white as a sheet, and sweat is running down your cheek! Anyway, it seems to me like there's something going on between the two of you. Phoenix: ... Actually... I don't know exactly why, but there's something about Iris that just tugs at me. I can't figure out whether I feel like I know her, or don't know her at all. It's really weird. Edgeworth: Hmm... Larry's Sketch Edgeworth: Get that piece of filth out of my face! Phoenix: You're still mad, huh, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: ... I know a thing or two about Larry Butz, just like you. We both know he likes to act up, but this? Even he couldn't make something like this up. If this is what he drew, then... this is what he saw. As unbelievable as it may seem... Phoenix: I know. That's what I think, too. Edgeworth: Every time! Every single time I see that guy, he's in it up to his neck! Phoenix: (I knew it. Edgeworth's still mad as a hornet at Larry.) Maya Fey profile Edgeworth: I don't know Maya Fey very well. But it seems to me that the girl is always landing herself in trouble. Phoenix: It seems to me that you know her better than you think! Edgeworth: I do sincerely hope she's going to be alright... Mia Fey profile Edgeworth: One of the biggest names in the world of law, as I'm sure you'll agree. For better or for worse, we were only destined to meet once in the courtroom. Phoenix: (I know. I read all about it.) Edgeworth: It was the first time for the both of us. Two novices, head to head. I can still remember how downhearted I felt after that trial ended the way it did... Phoenix: (I wonder if Mia felt the same way, too.) Pearl Fey profile Edgeworth: It seems Pearl was trapped on this side of the river on the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she tell you anything? Edgeworth: Listen, Wright... She's just a kid. I can't force things out of her. You'll have to be the one to find out what she knows. Godot profile Edgeworth: He's something of a legend, I hear. Phoenix: Don't say it like you don't know anything about him! Tell me what you know. Edgeworth: It's a bit strange, actually. If he really was anything special, I should have heard about him by now. I'm always well-informed about the rookies coming into the Prosecutor's Office, you know. Phoenix: Then you mean... ...he isn't anything special? Edgeworth: Hmph. You should already know the answer to that. Although, there is one other possibility... Phoenix: What's that? Edgeworth: He could have come into the profession from a different channel. Phoenix: What different channel? Edgeworth: There's more than one way to become a prosecutor, Wright. Perhaps he started off as a defense attorney, but decided it wasn't for him? Phoenix: A defense attorney...? (I didn't even know you could switch sides like that...) Dick Gumshoe profile Edgeworth: I was just with Detective Gumshoe. I treated him to some pasta. Phoenix: You owe him that much! After all, it's your fault his salary is so low! Edgeworth: H-How's it my fault? Phoenix: And look, if you're going to buy the guy lunch, at least get him something decent, OK? Gumshoe practically lives on pasta and noodles already. Edgeworth: Well I did order some extra parmesan cheese on top. He was crying tears of joy as he dug into it. It was quite moving. Phoenix: (...All you have to do is give the poor guy a raise...) Bikini profile Edgeworth: It's crossed my mind once or twice that her testimony might be a bunch of lies. Phoenix: There certainly are a lot of problems with it. Edgeworth: The thing is... ...as far as I can tell, she has no reason to deceive us. I believe she did meet the defendant at the Inner Temple, and witnessed the murder, too. The one in the Hazakura Temple courtyard, in any case. Iris profile Edgeworth: Apparently, Iris was taken in by the sisters here at the temple when she was a child. However, we still don't know much about her past, so we're looking into it. Phoenix: (This reminds me... Edgeworth went back to the Criminal Affairs Department to look up some stuff on her... I should ask him what he found.) Laurice Deauxnim profile Edgeworth: Apparently he had become something of an apprentice to Elise Deauxnim. Phoenix: Yes. Something like that. Edgeworth: He did this portrait for me earlier. Phoenix: That's great... Edgeworth: ... Let's just leave it at that about Larry, alright? Phoenix: (Looks like someone's still mad at the Butz for his performance in court today.) Franziska von Karma profile Edgeworth: It's been more than a year since I last saw Franziska myself. But it seems that she's been dying to see you again. Phoenix: She really said that...? Edgeworth: I believe she wants to eat you for breakfast! Or to put it another way, whip you silly. Literally and metaphorically. Phoenix: Oh. Edgeworth: Go on, let her have her way! It would make for a great anecdote about my trip! Phoenix: Forget it, Edgeworth! Miles Edgeworth profile Edgeworth: If you want to know how to run the perfect trial, there's a lot to study and learn. Phoenix: Oh, is that what you're studying about right now? Edgeworth: I've sat at the prosecutor's bench for trials in five different countries now. The first thing you must do is gain complete mastery of the language. It's quite a task. Phoenix: (I'd never get anywhere then! It's taken me a lifetime to sort of master one language!) Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry, Wright... You're a defense attorney, and I'm a prosecutor. It wouldn't be right for us to discuss things so intimately. Phoenix: (But you were acting for the defense in the trial today!) February 9Inner Temple Gate Phoenix: (I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...) Examine Bridge Phoenix: You can see Dusky Bridge from here, and it feels like an unusually long bridge to me. I guess the gorge is too wide to cross with a piece of rope or wire. In other words, no one has crossed it in either direction since the night of the murder. Which means that scene in the Inner Temple's garden couldn't have been set up by someone. Metal hook Phoenix: That's an anchor for one of the wires that used to hold up the bridge. I guess it must have snapped during the fire. Buddha statues Phoenix: Look at all the Buddha statues lined up along this path. Looks like one of the cakes someone left as an offering is missing, though. I guess Gumshoe couldn't resist, the poor guy. Incinerator Phoenix: There's something strange about this incinerator. I'm sure there was snow on it the first time I saw it. That, and the door's open. Someone's been burning something, that's for sure. It's a shame there isn't a trace of what it was left inside. Yellow gate Phoenix: On the other side of that little gate is the garden. Edgeworth is probably still in there, crying softly to himself. I guess we better hug it out and talk about what he's uncovered so far. Wooden log Phoenix: I can't read it very well, but I think that sign says, \"Inner Temple\" on it. Or maybe it says, \"Training Hall\". No. Maybe it's not that at all. Maybe it says, \"The Bridge of Dawn\". ... ...I really should get back to work! Gate Phoenix: Maya has got to be inside the Sacred Cavern. She's just got to be. I hate feeling so useless. It's driving me nuts. But I need to look for clues so that I'm ready when we finally get her out of there. February 9Dusky Bridge Phoenix: It's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again. Examine Bridge Phoenix: That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here! February 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate Phoenix: I wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type. Examine Gate Phoenix: This is one impressive gate. It's pretty grand for something that belongs to a branch family of the clan. I bet they make an exorbitant amount of money here. I mean, that whole Special Course thing has got to be good business! ... Ack! Noooo!! I'm starting to think like Maya! Main Hall Phoenix: You can see the Main Hall from here. Sister Bikini should be back by now. We were interrupted earlier by the earthquake. I think I should go pick up our conversation where we left off. Bell tower Phoenix: It's a quaint, little bell tower. I never would've thought that something this horrible was about to happen... ...when Iris rang the lights out bell that night. Snowmobile Phoenix: I wonder what this thing was used for on the night of the murder... There is only one key to this snowmobile, and Iris is the one who had it. So I have to wonder if it was her... ...But she says she never left Hazakura Temple that night. February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Phoenix: Looks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around. February 9Heavenly Hall Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Pearls! What are you doing here? Pearl: N-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!? Phoenix: Um... Well... We don't know yet. Pearl: Oh... I see... Butz: Hey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!? Phoenix: Larry... Butz: This is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves! Phoenix: This is the what...? Butz: Hey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that? Pearl: Look, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me! Phoenix: That's, um... great, Pearls. Butz: We're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?) Butz: No one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down! Pearl: ... Oh, Mystic Maya... Talk Laurice's sketch Phoenix: Larry, is there something you want to tell me about this picture? Butz: Heh! I've got nothing to say to you, Nick! My life's here now, with Pearl. Two losers cooking potatoes together forevermore! Phoenix: (What am I going to do with him...?) Alright then. What do you think about this picture, Pearls? Pearl: I... I think it's really well drawn! I can't draw at all, so I think it's really amazing. Butz: See! Someone appreciates it! It's tough getting the flames to look like that, you know. Pearl: It's supposed to be Sister Iris flying through the air, isn't it? I love it! It's like a dream. A wonderful fantasy. Butz: No, no, no! It wasn't a dream! She really flew! I'm telling you, Iris really flew that night. Pearl: But Mr. Laurice... Butz: *sigh* Not you too... Please don't look at me like that, Pearl... Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nutcase. I beg of you! Phoenix: (I guess this picture really is a representation of what Larry thinks he saw...) Butz: OK, so I was half asleep when I was here that night. But I was wide awake after the lightning struck! And I saw what I saw! It was exactly like I drew in the picture. Phoenix: (And it looks like I don't have any choice but to take this sketch at face value...) Butz: Hey! What's with the look of doubt on your face!? The night of the crime Phoenix: Umm, Pearls... Pearl: Y-Yes, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I've been meaning to ask you about the night of the murder... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: Where were you, and what exactly were you doing when it all happened? Pearl: I, um... I... I was just... Well... I'm just a kid, you know. I-I'm sure it doesn't really matter wh-what I was doing, d-d-does it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Sorry, Pearls... But yes, it does. On the night of the murder... ...you were supposed to be in Ms. Deauxnim's room, reading a book together. But... Ms. Deauxnim was murdered, and you, Pearls, were at the Inner Temple. Pearl: Nngh... Phoenix: Just what exactly happened that night, Pearls...? Pearl: ... I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I... I've been a bad girl. That's why I'm being punished. (Changed from [I know I'll be punished.] in the original release) Phoenix: What are you talking about, Pearls? Pearl: My spiritual power... It has disappeared. Phoenix: (What? Her powers have disappeared...?) The night of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Come on, Pearls. You can tell me. What happened to you on the night of the murder? Why were you found taking refuge at the Inner Temple today? Pearl: I... I... 5 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Wow. It must be a really big secret she's hiding.) Lost powers (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Phoenix: What do you mean your power has disappeared, Pearls? Pearl: ... It's... It's all over for me. A spirit medium who can't channel spirits is... like a painter who can't paint. Phoenix: ... Butz: Hey! What are you looking at me for!? Phoenix: Pearls. Did you try to channel someone's spirit right here at Hazakura Temple? Tried but failed, perhaps? Pearl: Ah... Waaaaaaaaah! Butz: Way to go, Nick! You made her cry! That's... That was really c-cruel of you... Waaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Just as I thought... I'm going to have to break her Psyche-Lock to get the truth out of her...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, Pearls...? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (...It's no good. She's in no condition to look at anything for me right now.) After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall: February 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall Bikini: Well!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!? Phoenix: It looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now. Phoenix: (I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.) Bikini: ... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition. Phoenix: We have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini. Bikini: Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we? Phoenix: Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple. Bikini: It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\" Phoenix: Someone was trying to destroy the main family line? Bikini: There is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line. Phoenix: ...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?) Talk Kurain Channeling Technique Bikini: You believe in the Technique, don't you Mr. Wright? You know its power is real... Phoenix: Yes... I do... (It's been two years since I first met Maya. (Changed from [It's been three years since I first met Maya.] in the original release) In that time, I've seen her channel the spirits of the dead plenty of times. During the Mask\u2606DeMasque case, and during Maggey Byrde's trial, too. Thanks to Maya, Mia's always on hand to help me out when I need her the most.) Bikini: The Kurain Technique has made a huge difference to the world, you know. I mean, the ability to commune with the dead... That's true psychic power, you know. Members of the Tradition have always been there, behind every important leader. Who wouldn't respect such a tremendous skill? Phoenix: I suppose so, but... With all that power and influence, I kind of expected you'd be really rich by now... Bikini: Are you saying we're poor, Mr. Wright? Ho ho ho! You're very direct, aren't you? People don't believe in it anymore, you see. All because of one little mistake... Phoenix: A mistake? What mistake? Bikini: It was 17 years ago. That's when everything came crashing down. All because of that incident. Phoenix: (\"That incident\"? Is she talking about what I think she is...?) Bikini: I'm sure the records still exist if you're interested. Locked up, of course. It was called the \"DL-6 Incident\". That's the name of the file. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... (I knew it!) (Changed from [The DL-6 Incident, huh?] in the original release) DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Kurain Channeling Technique\") Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident... ...I know it well. I handled a related case just two years ago. (Changed from [I handled a related case just three years ago.] in the original release) Bikini: ...! Ah! That's right... So it was you who was the defense attorney on that case... Phoenix: (A murder that took place 17 years ago...) Bikini: It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a spirit medium. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer. Phoenix: (And the medium who performed the channeling was Misty Fey, Maya's mother.) Bikini: Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action... Phoenix: But that man... He was found not guilty, wasn't he? Bikini: ...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud. Phoenix: But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all! Bikini: Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan... Phoenix: (Does she mean Maya!?) Family feud Bikini: The spiritual power of the Kurain Channeling Technique is in the blood. Phoenix: (Maya's told me the exact same thing before...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (According to Maya, only the women in the family can inherit that power.) Bikini: The main family's bloodline stems directly from Mystic Ami. But with each new generation, only one daughter becomes the new Master. Phoenix: And the ones who don't, become branch families, right? Bikini: That's right. And it's always the cause of tragedy. Phoenix: ... You know, Maya had a sister, too. An older sister named Mia... Bikini: Oh yes. I've heard of her. Phoenix: What!? You know about Mia!? Bikini: Of course. She became a lawyer in the hopes of discovering what happened to her mother. Phoenix: (And lost her life as a result...) Bikini: Do you know what Mystic Mia is rumored to have said? She said it wasn't only because of her mother that she became a lawyer... She also didn't want to fight with her sister over the leadership of the Tradition. Phoenix: Really...!? Bikini: Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt. Phoenix: (That's right. Misty Fey had an elder sister, too. And Misty, having superior powers, managed to usurp the Master's seat from her...) Bikini: Mystic Misty's sister is Mystic Morgan, as you probably know. Phoenix: Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, Kurain Village. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make her own daughter the next Master. Bikini: I suppose if you know about Mystic Morgan's daughter... ...then you must've already realized that Iris... Phoenix: Huh? Iris...? (What's Iris got to do with any of this?) Bikini: That Iris is Mystic Morgan's daughter... Phoenix: Wh... IRIS IS WHAT!? (Is she kidding me!? Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter!?) Morgan and Iris (appears after \"Family feud\") Phoenix: Did you just say that Iris is Morgan Fey's daughter? Bikini: Oops! I thought you already knew! It sounded like you'd met one of Mystic Morgan's daughters already. Phoenix: I-I have. I know her very well. Bikini: Oh? Phoenix: Yes. Pearls. Pearl Fey. But I always thought she was an only child. Bikini: ... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she? Phoenix: Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master. Bikini: I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had three daughters, not two. Phoenix: Wait, what!? ...Th-Three? (Changed from [Whaaa!? ...Th-Three?] in the original release) Bikini: Yes. Iris, her twin sister, and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: WHAT!? Tw-Twin sister? Bikini: Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him. Phoenix: How awful... Bikini: He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see. Phoenix: (It's unbelievable! If Iris has a twin sister... Could it be...?) Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the name of Iris's sister? Bikini: ............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler. Phoenix: (Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...) Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this, Sister Bikini? Bikini: Aaaah! Our scroll! Our precious scroll! What on earth have you done to it!? Phoenix: No, no! It wasn't me! I swear! (But who did this, and why would anyone want to cover this thing in gravy? More importantly, does this have anything to do with the case...?) Maya Fey profile Bikini: So... This young lady is the new Master... Phoenix: That's right. Maya Fey. Bikini: Oh dear, oh dear... If I'd known who she was... I would've prepared a feast, not a boring old pot roast and some gravy! Phoenix: ... Once we get her out, you can give her all the feasts you want. Bikini: Of course! You just make sure you get her out, alright? She's the Master! You just have to rescue her! Pearl Fey profile Bikini: Ah... This poor little girl... Phoenix: (First I lost Maya, and now Pearls... How much more pain is this case going to cause me!? Urgh... Not to mention this fever is giving me a killer migraine...) Elise Deauxnim profile Bikini: How... How can I ever make up for this...? Phoenix: Make up for what? Bikini: For allowing harm to come to such an important person! Phoenix: (Sister Bikini must feel really responsible for what happened... Ms. Deauxnim was the Master after all...) Morgan Fey profile Bikini: When I think about it, I do kind of feel sorry for Mystic Morgan. It wasn't her fault that her sister was a more powerful spirit medium. Mystic Morgan just couldn't compete with her sister. It must have been really tough on her... Phoenix: Even so... That doesn't excuse all the things she did. Bikini: ... No... Of course not. ?????? profile Bikini: Iris had a twin sister... That's really all I know about her. That and the fact that she was taken away from her mother by her jeweler father. I don't have any idea where she is or what she's doing now. Phoenix: (I could tell her... But she'd probably have a coronary and a half...) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh... Bikini: Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family... Phoenix: Anger? What do you mean? Bikini: Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan. Phoenix: (That's why she had Pearls?) Bikini: It seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her. Phoenix: (So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!) February 9Heavenly Hall Phoenix: Hmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later. February 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard ???: ............ Phoenix: (Sounds like someone's happy. What tune is that they're humming...?) Gumshoe: \u266aNo motive, no crime. No motive, no crime. Sing it with me - No motive, no crime!\u266a \u266a...I remember, when we use to search... in the Channeling Room in Kurain...\u266a Whoop! I love my job! Who cares if the clues I find are no good? That's not what investigating's all about! The investigator investigates for the love of investigating! It's a passion! \u266aGood cases we have, good cases we've lost... Along the way...\u266a Phoenix: (...I would have never guessed that Gumshoe was into reggae.) Gumshoe: \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Hey, pal. Phoenix: Huh? Who, me? Gumshoe: How long have you been there? Phoenix: ... I just got here. Gumshoe: ...Oh, OK. Phoenix: So what are you up to, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm investigating, pal. I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon. Phoenix: (The real murder weapon...) Gumshoe: That barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though... Phoenix: (A letter?) Talk The investigation Phoenix: So how's the investigation going, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I don't know if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess it can't hurt. Looks like the murder took place in the Inner Temple garden. And they're taking that bloody writing on the lantern pretty seriously back at HQ. Phoenix: What!? You mean...? Gumshoe: I don't have the details, pal. All I know is, if you don't find Maya down in that Sacred Cavern... ...we're gonna be faced with one ugly situation. Phoenix: What kind of ugly situation are we looking at here...? Gumshoe: ... You got me! I don't know. They're not my words, pal. Phoenix: Then who said it? Gumshoe: Mr. Godot. Phoenix: Godot!? (What did he mean by that?) The letter Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Phoenix: C-Can I...? Do you mind? Gumshoe: Sure, go nuts! I don't want it, pal. You can have it. It's all spirit mediums and Masters and stuff. I bet it's got no relation to the case. Phoenix: (Spirit mediums!?) Burnt Letter added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (It's got to be important if it mentions spirit mediums and Masters. I'd better give it a good looking over and some serious thought...) Gumshoe: Make sure you chuck it in the trash when you're done. Littering's a crime, pal! The letter (subsequent times) Phoenix: About that letter you found... Gumshoe: Don't remind me, pal! I'm busting a gut here trying to find the murder weapon... ...and all I find is some burnt up old letter. Phoenix: Burnt up old letter? Gumshoe: Yeah. It was in that incinerator right outside the Inner Temple. Phoenix: The incinerator!? (I knew it! I knew I wasn't imagining it! There was snow on the incinerator when I first saw it. But after the incident, the snow had melted away. Which means someone used the incinerator on the night of the murder.) Gumshoe: What's up with you, pal? I've got it right here if you wanna take a look. Murder weapon Phoenix: So what do you know about the real murder weapon so far? Gumshoe: Well it wasn't the Shichishito that was found impaled in the victim's body. Mr. Edgeworth proved that in court today. Phoenix: ...Yes, that's true. Gumshoe: In which case, it must've been another blade. Phoenix: And that's what you're running around like a headless chicken looking for now, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. And man, is it tiring work! But let me tell you something, pal... I'm no chicken. We've got the feather of forensics in our cap these days. We're using the department's secret weapon on this! Phoenix: Secret weapon...? Secret weapon (appears after \"Murder weapon\") Phoenix: What's this secret weapon of yours? Gumshoe: You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK? Phoenix: Alright. Gumshoe: The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far? Phoenix: No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.) Gumshoe: So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector! Phoenix: (Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...) Gumshoe: Well? You wanna give scientific investigation a go? Phoenix: Huh? M-Me? Gumshoe: I've been using this thing for hours now. It gets pretty boring after a while. Why don't you give it a try? Phoenix: (I don't know... Should I help Detective Gumshoe out, or not?) Play forensics expert Leads to: \"Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\" Save it for later Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: No. I, um... I've actually gotta be someplace... Gumshoe: Oh, really? That's too bad. I'll just take a break by myself for a while, then. I'm gonna get you to do this somehow, pal! You'll see! Phoenix: (I thought you liked doing field work! Isn't that what you were just singing about!?) Leads back to Talk options Present Hanging Scroll Phoenix: Do you know anything about this scroll, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Well, I know it smells great! Yeah, this is just the kind of weather for some steaming mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh! And weenies! Mashed potatoes with gravy and weenies! Potatoes and weenies are the two greatest foods invented by man. A dream combination! Although, I can't afford to try them together yet. It's an unfulfilled dream... Phoenix: Um... I was hoping you'd have more to say about the scroll and less about the gravy... Gumshoe: Oh, sorry. Nah, I can't tell you much about that scroll, pal. Phoenix: (...Why do I bother anymore?) Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile Gumshoe: She sure was a mysterious person. Her real name, her past... It's all a complete mystery. Phoenix: (Not quite. She was Maya's mother. But Gumshoe doesn't know that yet...) Gumshoe: Just like every other case, huh? Always a mystery! Victim's Staff Gumshoe: That staff belonged to the victim. Phoenix: Yeah, and apart from the crystal missing from the top, there's nothing wrong with it. Gumshoe: Oh, I just remembered something important! This is just between us, OK? Phoenix: O-OK... What is it? Gumshoe: I've never told anyone this before... It's a secret. I... I actually wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Is that it? Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it. Phoenix: (Hmm... How did the crystal sphere get separated from the staff? And what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Larry's Sketch Gumshoe: It was like a circus today in court. All thanks to this little sketch. You want my advice? You should ignore it, pal. Phoenix: Look, I know Larry's a bit out there. But he wouldn't just draw something like this as a joke. Gumshoe: Then I guess I should start getting hyped for tomorrow's trial. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Seeing you trying to explain that thing... I wouldn't miss it for the world, pal! Phoenix: ... (Maybe he's right. Maybe I should just ignore this useless piece of graffiti.) Crystal Sphere Phoenix: This was found close to Dusky Bridge, wasn't it? Gumshoe: That's what that artist guy said, yeah. Right after the defendant flew over the burning bridge! According to his testimony, she dropped it when she landed on the other side. Phoenix: (But this crystal didn't belong to Iris.) Gumshoe: There are traces of blood on it too, you know, pal. Phoenix: (The real question is what was it doing near the foot of Dusky Bridge...?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: The girl was trapped over at the Inner Temple since the night of the murder. Phoenix: Did she say anything to you about Maya? She wouldn't tell me... Gumshoe: She's not gonna tell me something if she wouldn't even speak to you, pal. She was real upset. She wouldn't stop crying. Godot profile Gumshoe: That guy's got more mysteries than a Choose Your Own Escapade book, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Trust me. Gumshoe: I can't believe he skipped the trial like that, without even getting permission. He'd have been fired for sure if he worked for a normal company. Phoenix: Do you know where he is now? Gumshoe: Nah. But I bet he's walking around somewhere with a mug of coffee in one hand. Phoenix: (Hmm, I should've figured... It looks like Gumshoe doesn't know about Godot's physical condition...) Godot: Of course, being extradited from Hell is a tedious affair. The meticulous regeneration and adjustment of all your internal organs is... Well... Let's just say modern medicine allows us all to live to a ripe old age. Even someone like me. Phoenix: (He had a good reason for missing the trial. So why didn't he tell anyone about it?) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Hey, you wanna hear something, pal? Come on, I know you do! Maggey says she's gonna buy me a new coat! Phoenix: Really? That's great! Gumshoe: Yeah. I think it's to say thanks for helping her out during that last case! Which means... I can finally chuck out this stinky, sweat-soaked rag! Bikini profile Gumshoe: She's a sweet old lady. She doesn't look like the lying type to me. Phoenix: But there was a problem with her testimony, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I don't think it was her fault. She was just trying to say the right thing, and it came out wrong, that's all. I know what it's like. Happens to me all the time! Iris profile Gumshoe: I dunno. I'm not so sure anymore. The clues we found today have turned this case all topsy-turvy. I can't see how Iris could've done it now. Phoenix: What clues are you talking about? Gumshoe: I dunno if I should be telling you, pal. But I guess I can let you in on it. The fact that the Inner Temple Garden was the crime scene. And... that bloody writing. However you look at it, Maya Fey's the only person who... ... Hey! Quit giving me that evil stare, would you? You look just like Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: It wasn't Maya! There is no way it could've been her! Gumshoe: I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Franziska von Karma profile Gumshoe: Hey, speaking of Ms. von Karma, what's she up to...? Phoenix: She's keeping an eye on Iris at the Inner Temple. Gumshoe: Oh, really!? Phew! I can relax at last; now that you've lost her. Phoenix: She has a real thing for hitting you with that whip of hers, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah, but I'm kinda getting used to it... which scares me a lot. Oh! So this one time, she forgot her whip at home or something... Phoenix: And...? Tell me you were able to have a violence-free day. Gumshoe: Nah. She slapped me instead. I prefer the whip. Getting slapped all day makes you look like such a loser. Phoenix: (And being whipped doesn't?) Miles Edgeworth profile Gumshoe: I haven't seen Mr. Edgeworth for about a year. Talk about a long time! Phoenix: Do you know why he moved overseas? Gumshoe: I don't know. Probably to look cool. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: There's a lot of weight attached to doing research overseas, you know. Once I've done my stint in Paris, you'll have to call me Monsieur Gumchaussure. Phoenix: ... (People really don't get Edgeworth, do they?) Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: I've seen this lady someplace before. ............ Isn't she that jaw-droppingly large strawberry desert woman? Oh, yeah! She's Pearl Fey's mother, right? Phoenix: That's right. Gumshoe: She was involved in that incident in Kurain Village last year, wasn't she? ... Hey! She was the one who did it! Phoenix: (Why doesn't he think his whole thought through BEFORE opening his mouth!?) Gumshoe: Yeah, that was one ugly case, huh, pal? Phoenix: (\"Was\"? I don't know... The more we look at this case, the more I feel like that one never ended...) Gumshoe: She's locked up safe in solitary confinement at the detention center, though... At least we can rule her out of this case! Anything else Phoenix: What about this, Detective Gumshoe? Any thoughts? Gumshoe: Yeah... Well... It's pretty chilly today, huh? My brain doesn't work properly in the cold. Phoenix: Perhaps we'll just have to wait until Summer when it's warmer? Gumshoe: Oh, no. My brain doesn't work properly in the heat. I'm kinda weak in the head. Phoenix: (There are some things you're better off not advertising, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: Come on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you. Phoenix: Alright, then... I guess I'll give it a go... Gumshoe: Like I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it! Phoenix: Oh, bother. Gumshoe: So, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right? Phoenix: Sure. That's what we're trying to find out. Gumshoe: Right. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic. (Changed from [Once you've hit something metallic, the CHECK gauge will flash.] in the original release) And when that happens, press [the A Button / Enter] to give the area a good, hard stare. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the area a good, hard stare.] in the original release) This thing picks up metallic objects that are hidden from sight, too... Take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Metal detector Top right corner Phoenix: (Is there something up on the eaves?) Gumshoe: I can't tell from here, pal. ...Meh, just forget about it. Phoenix: But it's right under Elise Deauxnim's window! And it's the perfect spot for hiding something long and thin like a sword! Gumshoe: ... I'll go take a look. Ah, it was nothing, thank goodness. Someone just dropped a spoon. Phoenix: Why are you so happy about that...? Gumshoe: Well, imagine if the murder weapon had turned up there... It'd make me look pretty dumb, huh? Phoenix: (...At least he recognizes that much.) Skis or ski poles Phoenix: It's just a pair of skis. Nothing useful for our case here. Gumshoe: I'm actually pretty good on skis you know, pal. I just love to fly down the slopes with my coat fluttering in the wind! Phoenix: Really? I had no idea. How good are you, then? Gumshoe: Well... I'm better on skis than I am on skates. But not as good as when I'm on a snowboard. Phoenix: (That's a pretty detailed answer.) Gumshoe: Oh! But you know what I'm best at? Making mashed potatoes and gravy. Phoenix: ... (The guy's losing it. Must be the altitude. We'd better get back to the investigation...) Sled Phoenix: That's odd. This sled's made of plastic... Gumshoe: It says, \"Bikini #1\" on the side... Phoenix: (Maybe there's something under it...) Hey, what's this? A-A badge...? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaaaa! I've been hunting high and low for that! Phoenix: I-It's yours, Detective? Gumshoe: That thing's priceless to a guy like me, pal. A cop can't be a cop without his badge! I'm sure glad I put that dime in there now. Phoenix: How did you manage to drop your badge here, of all places!? Gumshoe: I know! I bet it happened this morning. I was playing around with the sled and... Phoenix: Stop right there. I don't need to hear any more. (Step)ladder Gumshoe: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Gumshoe: What's the difference? Looks like a normal ladder to me, pal. Phoenix: (Surely everyone knows the difference... I mean, they're pretty ordinary objects...) Gumshoe: I've met plenty of guys like you, always picking on the smallest details. The vegetable store guy near my place does it all the time. He even corrects me when I ask for a head of lettuce. \"That's a cabbage,\" he says. I'm telling you, they're the exact same thing! Phoenix: No they're not! They're completely different! Gumshoe: You have to plant both of them firmly in the ground before they can grow, don't you? Listen. You gotta take a step back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Otherwise you could miss a really important clue. That's advice from a pro, pal! Phoenix: (...The last person I need advice from is this guy in front of me.) Snow on left side of sled Phoenix: This must be an old pan handle or something. Gumshoe: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Huh, what? Gumshoe: That was my nickname in junior high. Phoenix: What, \"pan handle\"? Gumshoe: I didn't have much money back then, pal. I used to bum stuff off the other kids sometimes, so they called me \"Panhandler\". Phoenix: ... \"Panhandler\", huh? I can see that. Gumshoe: Thinking back, it's actually kind of a nice memory now. Snow below (step)ladder Phoenix: This looks like... a wallet? Gumshoe: Ah-haaaa! That's where it's been! Phoenix: Is it yours, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm always dropping it, so I put a bell on it. Phoenix: But you still dropped it anyway... Gumshoe: Yeah, but now I found it again, pal. Phoenix: ...Your wallet is completely empty. Gumshoe: Well, I drop it all the time, so I don't put money in it anymore. Phoenix: ... Then how come the metal detector picked it up...? Gumshoe: Must be because of the bell, I guess. Snow below Ami Fey statue Phoenix: Hey, I found a dollar coin. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Money!? If you find money, you have to turn it in to the police. Or a detective. If the owner doesn't come forward within six months, you get to keep 10 percent! The other ninety percent goes to m... I mean, to the Police Department. Phoenix: D-Don't get so close to me, Detective. Give me some space, will you!? Here's the coin. Happy? Gumshoe: ... I definitely made the right decision becoming a detective. Phoenix: (Yikes... Talk about a serious case of denial...) Snow left of stepping stones Phoenix: What's this...? A pen? Gumshoe: Hey! I've been looking all over for that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? It's yours? Gumshoe: Yeah. My old man gave it to me when I qualified as a detective. He told me it'd be good for sticking in suspects' faces. Phoenix: That makes you detectives sound really nasty. Gumshoe: It's my dream to stick it in your face one day, Wright! Phoenix: (Then don't go losing it!) Ami Fey statue Gumshoe: That Shichishito next to the golden statue wasn't the real murder weapon, pal. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd check it again anyway. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! That reminds me! Do you know about that sword? It's supposed to represent the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one. Phoenix: Yes. I heard something about that. Gumshoe: You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life I'd be leading had I not joined the Homicide Division. Phoenix: You think about that kind of stuff, Detective? Gumshoe: Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger... Phoenix: (...There's something to be said about the humor value of Gumshoe as the Blue Badger.) Snow near front lantern's grate Phoenix: (Looks like there's something round buried in the ground here...) Gumshoe: Don't touch that, pal! Phoenix: Huh? What is it? Gumshoe: It's a trap! People set them out to catch us detectives. They're real nasty. Phoenix: A trap... for detectives? You mean like those fierce traps with sharp teeth that are supposed to snag your leg? Gumshoe: Yeah! Those! I got my finger caught in one of those once. Phoenix: Y-Your finger? Gumshoe: There was this bit of cheese, and it looked so tasty. I reached out, and then... bam! Phoenix: (...I'm not sure I know how to respond to a story as stupidly pitiful as that.) Staff Phoenix: This is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, isn't it? Gumshoe: Scientifically speaking, they're usually made of wood. Phoenix: But the detector is reacting to it. Gumshoe: Yeah, but however you look at it, the thing's made of wood, alright? I don't bother investigating anything unless it looks like it might be metallic. Phoenix: (Isn't the whole point of a metal detector to find metal where you can't see it?) Gumshoe: It's weird that this thing is causing a racket... Phoenix: Here, let me take a look at it. Gumshoe: Hey! Hands off! Examining evidence is a job for the... *crack* Phoenix: Ack! The top is coming off! Gumshoe: Look what you've done! You've damaged a really important piece of evidence. Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaah! Gumshoe: Th-That's a... Phoenix: A... A sword... Gumshoe: Inside the staff... Phoenix: Is this... Could it be... Gumshoe: ...The murder weapon!? Talk Murder weapon (after using metal detector on staff) Leads to: \"I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.\" Phoenix: I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff. Gumshoe: They call this kind of thing a sword-cane, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot! Phoenix: (...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword? Gumshoe: No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now. Phoenix: (Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it. Gumshoe: ... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh? Phoenix: No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder! Gumshoe: ... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal! Phoenix: (It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!) Gumshoe: OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! \u266aEvery case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...\u266a Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait up, Detective! Gumshoe: Huh? What is it, pal? I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know. Phoenix: You're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while? Gumshoe: Huh? What are you talking about, pal!? Phoenix: Please! Just until we find Maya... Gumshoe: Maya? What's this got to do with her? Phoenix: I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gumshoe: Oh? How so? Phoenix: Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel. Gumshoe: Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd-- Phoenix: Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern. Gumshoe: You're... looking kinda viridian there... Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished. Phoenix: ...I understand. Gumshoe: This is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal. Phoenix: Thank you, Detective. Gumshoe: ... Don't worry... She'll be fine. Phoenix: Gumshoe... Gumshoe: You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal? Phoenix: Sure... Thanks... Victim's Staff received from Detective Gumshoe for safe-keeping. Phoenix: (I can't help but wonder, though... What was Elise Deauxnim doing with a staff like this in the first place...?) Present Victim's Staff Gumshoe: I still can't believe it, pal! I'd never have guessed there was a sword in that thing. Sure, there isn't any blood left on it, but... ...there's a good chance this is the murder weapon, pal! Phoenix: But this is Ms. Deauxnim's staff, right? That would mean she was killed with her own weapon. Gumshoe: ... I guess so. Phoenix: And there's something else that's bothering me, too. Gumshoe: Oh? What's that, pal? Phoenix: Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her? Gumshoe: ... That's a good question. And there's gotta be a good answer to it, I guess. Good luck finding it, pal! Phoenix: (...I'm beginning to see why he receives the salary he does.) Garden Talk Dahlia Hawthorne (appears after presenting\u00a0??? profile) Edgeworth: It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died. Phoenix: You're talking about Terry Fawles, right? Edgeworth: ...! Y-You know about that case...!? Phoenix: You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago. Edgeworth: Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking. Phoenix: Her sister? Edgeworth: Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife. Phoenix: Oh... (And this is when she entered my life... The woman who tried to kill me.) So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out? Edgeworth: ... Does it really matter? (Changed from [There is no need.] in the original release) Like I said, Dahlia isn't connected with this case. Phoenix: Why are you so sure about that? Edgeworth: It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is dead. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak. Dahlia's death (appears after \"Dahlia Hawthorne\") Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) It seems you're not aware of one other connection yet, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: And what is that? Phoenix: It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's mother. Edgeworth: What's their mother got to do with any of this? Phoenix: She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Edgeworth: ... Did you say, \"Kurain Channeling Technique\"...? Phoenix: D-Do you know something about it? Edgeworth: Oh, yes. I know it's connected with that fraudulent spirit medium! Phoenix: (Fraudulent...?) Edgeworth: I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the \"Master\" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent! Phoenix: ...Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the DL-6 Incident case file and you'll know! Phoenix: (Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the victim in that case.) Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real... Dahlia's death (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by, \"Dahlia Hawthorne is dead\", Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: ... Wright... I must confess that in reading her file... (Changed from [I only just discovered this, Wright, but...] in the original release) I came to know of the murder case you were involved in during your college years. (Changed from [I never knew about the murder case you were involved in during your college years.] in the original release) Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... ...thanks to the persistence of Mia Fey. Dahlia: ... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Phoenix: (At the time... Dahlia... It's like she was possessed by a demon or something...) Edgeworth: It's been almost five years since that guilty verdict was handed down... (Changed from [It's been six years since that guilty verdict was handed down...] in the original release) ...and her sentence was finally carried out. She was executed... last month. Phoenix: E-Executed? Edgeworth: I'm sure that's a bit of a shock for you, Wright. And for more reasons than one. But do you understand now? She can't possibly be connected with this case. She's dead, and once someone is dead, there is no way to revive them. Phoenix: ... (There's no way to revive the dead...? Hmm... I wonder...) Present ??? profile Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth... Did you know that Iris had a twin sister...? Edgeworth: WHAT!? A-A twin...? You can't be serious! Phoenix: Sister Bikini told me. But... The problem is, she didn't know the name of this twin. Edgeworth: There was nothing about Iris having a sister in the files I checked. Phoenix: Well, Iris was taken in by the temple when she was really young. Apparently her sister was raised by her father. A jeweler, I think. Edgeworth: A jeweler!? ... Wright, I... I might just know who this twin sister of hers is. Phoenix: I had a feeling you'd say that. Let me guess... Her name is Dahlia Hawthorne, right? Edgeworth: ... Yes, exactly. Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about her, Edgeworth... Please. Training Hall Talk The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Iris: I... I was in my room in the Main Hall that night. As soon as I heard that I'd been spotted at the Inner Temple, I knew. I knew it was my sister. Dahlia, the other half of me who... passed away last month. Phoenix: (Just as I suspected. The \"Iris\" that Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder... It was Dahlia Hawthorne!) Why didn't you tell me this before!? Iris: B-Because... Because my sister always does the right thing. Phoenix: Excuse me? Iris: And because I mustn't get in the way of what she's trying to do. I already betrayed her once before! I can't do it again! Phoenix: You betrayed her? What do you mean? Iris: That's why I... I have to accept I may be found guilty. It's the only way. Phoenix: (What is she talking about!?) Betrayal (Changed from [The traitor] in the original release) (appears after \"The night of the crime\") Iris: You know about it, don't you, Mr. Wright? About the fake kidnapping that took place here on Eagle Mountain 11 years ago? Phoenix: ...! Iris: That was the start of it all. It's what started her down that twisted path. (Changed from [That was the start of it all. It twisted her entire destiny.] in the original release) She started to commit crime after crime, and in the end, she... she lost her life. I-It's all because I betrayed her! Phoenix: How did you betray her, Iris? Iris: It was no coincidence that Eagle Mountain is where the exchange was to take place. After all, I... I helped plan the whole thing. Phoenix: What!? Iris: But I got scared, so I ran away. Phoenix: What are you talking about!? Why would you help her!? Stealing 2 million dollars... from your own father! That's awful! Iris: But I promised. I promised that I'd help. And... She didn't do it for the money. Phoenix: Huh? Iris: It was revenge. On our father. Phoenix: R-Revenge? Revenge (appears after \"Betrayal\") Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.) Iris: But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a terrible mistake... It was during the investigation of the DL-6 Incident. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there. Phoenix: And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple? Iris: Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see. Phoenix: Oh... Iris: And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally. Phoenix: (I think I'm finally beginning to see how the pieces fit together...) von Karma: ...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan. Phoenix: ...That's what it looks like. Phoenix: Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me. Iris: What is it...? Phoenix: During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with a certain college student in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...? Iris: ... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts. Phoenix: ... ...I see. Thank you for your help. Iris: You're welcome... von Karma: Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate! Iris: Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise. Phoenix: Thank you. (I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant secret left to unlock... Pearls's Psyche-Lock...) [sic] Revenge (subsequent times) Phoenix: What do you mean by revenge...? Iris: He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell... Phoenix: (Her mother? She must be talking about Morgan Fey...) Iris: Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain. Phoenix: (That would be Misty Fey... Maya's mother.)

That's why I want to believe what you're telling me, too. But I can't. Because this person saw you somewhere else on the night of the murder!

I believe you're innocent.\" Phoenix: I'm talking about Sister Bikini, of course. Iris: Sister Bikini... Phoenix: Her testimony in court today was very clear. Bikini: That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder! Iris: That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright. 1 LOCK BROKEN Iris: The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late. Phoenix: What time was that? Iris: Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you. Iris: Huh? Phoenix: Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this! Present Iris's Hood or Iris's Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright...

Leads back to: \"Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!\" Phoenix: You yourself testified to the contrary, don't you remember? You said you rang the lights out bell at 10 o'clock that night. Iris: Ah! Phoenix: Plus, only moments before you rang that bell... ...you were seen at the Main Hall by the most reliable witness I have. Iris: Who's that? Phoenix: Me. Iris: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: We even spoke a little that evening. That's when you gave me this. Surely you haven't forgotten? Iris: ... N-No... That's right. I remember... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And that brings us to another puzzling fact, Iris. At 10 o'clock on the night of the murder... ...you were seen in two different places at the same time! Iris: ... Phoenix: It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris. So far, I've managed to prove two things. First, on the night of the incident, you were at the Inner Temple. And second, at the exact same time, you were ringing the bell at Hazakura Temple! There's only one possible explanation for this apparent impossibility! You were at Hazakura Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once. That being the case, you were probably really at... Iris: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? What is it? Iris: That's what I wanted to ask you. What was that \"probably\" you just came out with? Phoenix: I, umm... Well... The problem is, you spoke to witnesses at both the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. It's kind of hard to disprove either sighting, but... Iris: That's no position for a lawyer to find himself in, is it? Phoenix: N-No... (She got me there!) Iris: It seems to me like there just isn't a solution to this puzzle. It's probably best if you just forget the whole thing, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ... I'm sorry, Iris, but I can't do that. Leads back to: \"So far, I've managed to prove two things.\" You were at the Inner Temple. Phoenix: There is only one of you, Iris. You couldn't possibly have been in two places at once.

Leads to: \"On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time.\" Phoenix: On the night of the incident, you were seen in two different places at the same time. Which means, there must have been two of you. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris. Iris: B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible! Phoenix: Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise. Iris: *gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me! Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Iris: ... Err, Mr. Wright... When you said there was \"another me\"... ...I was kind of expecting someone who looked like me. You know? Phoenix: I... I guess so... Iris: In that case, are you saying that I look like this person? Phoenix: Well, I can't say with 100% certainty, but... Iris: Can you show me something you are 100% certain about then...? Phoenix: (I really need to get to the bottom of this. Iris is determined to hide something from me. I can't drag it out of her unless I can show her some irrefutable evidence.) Iris: I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I don't mean to be uncooperative, but... Leads back to: \"You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me?\" Phoenix: I have a firm grasp of the situation now, Iris. You have a sister, don't you? A twin sister, perhaps? Iris: Ah! Phoenix: That's right. Dahlia Hawthorne. A woman I know only too well. Iris: ... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer... Phoenix: Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...? Iris: ... Phoenix: I'm sorry. Iris: Thank you. Phoenix: There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This \"second you\" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, Dahlia Hawthorne! Iris: B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that? Phoenix: Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Iris: ...! Phoenix: That night... ...someone channeled Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me! Iris: ...

After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy. Phoenix: The gravy? Pearl: I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter. Phoenix: I see. And then? Pearl: Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area. Phoenix: The guest area? Pearl: Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over. Phoenix: Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall? Pearl: Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ... Phoenix: Pearls, did you fall asleep? Pearl: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it! Butz: Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens. Phoenix: Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple? Pearl: Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and... Phoenix: (And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?)

Phoenix: Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry. Lost powers (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit.\" I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring. Phoenix: So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit? Pearl: No... I tried, but I couldn't do it! Phoenix: You couldn't do it...? Pearl: I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened. I tried and I tried and I tried... Yesterday, this morning, the whole time! But I just couldn't do it...! Butz: D-Don't let it get you down, Pearl. It'll all work out. If you want, I'll come flying through the sky for you! Whooosh! Just like that! Phoenix: (So she never managed to channel the spirit...) Is that why you think your spiritual powers are gone? Pearl: Yes. I... I don't know what to do... Phoenix: Isn't there any other explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit? Pearl: ... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though... Phoenix: Could you please tell me what it is anyway? Pearl: It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit. Phoenix: Someone else? What do you mean? Pearl: Well there's only one of each spirit, right...? Butz: Yup, it's like dating a girl, Nick. You can't see a hot chick if she's already taken! Phoenix: (Then that would mean on the night of the murder... ...someone else channeled her spirit before Pearls could. Someone else channeled the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne!) Pearl: I'm a failure. I couldn't even grant my mother's final wish... Phoenix: Her \"final wish\"...? Pearl: Yes.

Phoenix: I-I guess so, yeah... Pearl: There was a picture with her letter, too. Phoenix: A picture? Pearl: Of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Usually, a picture is enough to channel someone's spirit, but this time... Butz: ...Pretty weird, huh? Phoenix: (Like Larry knows anything about this stuff!)

Your face has turned a really strange color. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You shouldn't work so hard, you know. You need to take a break once in a while. Phoenix: (...Being chided by a 9 year old. How embarrassing... But there's really only one thing Pearls could have been worried about that night. She must have been worried about \"her\". There's no one else it could be.) Pearl: I'll go get some sheets to make up a bed for you. Phoenix: No, no, it's OK! I'll die of pneumonia if I nap in a drafty little shack like this!

Leads back to: \"So Pearls never went to Ms. Deauxnim's room...\" Phoenix: It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was Maya, wasn't it? Pearl: Ah!

Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho! Phoenix: Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you? Pearl: ... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that... Pearl: Unngh... Phoenix: About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple? Pearl: Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock. Phoenix: Until after 10? How did you know what time it was? Pearl: Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out. Phoenix: (She heard the lights out bell...?) The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing. Pearl: I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible. Phoenix: (She was trying to hear the bell...?) Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell? Pearl: Huh!? Oh! I... Phoenix: I think I know why.

Wh-Why would I d-do something like...?

Pearl: H-How do you know that!? Phoenix: Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...? Elise: Perhaps we can read some books together. Pearl: R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading. Elise: Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me? Pearl: Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this? Elise: It says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word. Phoenix: Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read \"gravely\" and \"roast\". But what she didn't teach you... ...is what they meant! Pearl: \"Gravely\" sounded like \"gravy\" to me, and the only \"roast\" I could think of was the food... Phoenix: And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the Master in gravy from that night's pot roast. Pearl: ... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea...

Phoenix: W-Why do you say that? Godot: Because Maya Fey isn't coming back. Phoenix: What? You don't know what you're talking about! How can you say something like that? Godot: It was your job to protect her, Trite. Just like it was your job to protect Mia Fey... Two sisters, caught up in the worst circumstances. Phoenix: I... I realize that, but... Godot: And you were the only one who was by their sides. You were the only one who could have saved them. Phoenix: But I didn't know anything about what was going on! Godot: Ha...! What did I just say, Trite? Being oblivious is a heinous crime in itself. Phoenix: ...! Godot: Tomorrow... We'll settle everything in court tomorrow. ...Once and for all. Pearl: M-Mr. Nick... Is... Is what that man just said true? Phoenix: It'll be alright, Pearls. I'm sure Maya's alive. You'll see for yourself tomorrow! Pearl: I... Yeah! That's right! I know I can trust you, Mr. Nick! Morgan: ...My dear Pearl... ...You've done so well, my child. My Pearl... ...It's better that you don't know what you've done... (Changed from [...It's better that you don't know...] in the original release) ...I knew this day would come for you... ...The blood of the main family is no more... ...Now, finally... After all this time... the Master's seat is yours... (Changed from [...Now you... You are to take the place at the head of the Fey clan...] in the original release) ...My last, great wish... It seems I was just in time... To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Nothing to examine during metal detecting session Phoenix: Hmm... It doesn't look like there's anything here. Gumshoe: Hey, pal! All you gotta do is watch the detector and let IT tell YOU what's where, OK! (Changed from [Hey, pal! You've gotta watch the CHECK gauge and wait for it to flash, OK!?] in the original release) Phoenix: (Alright, already... I'm not exactly a wiz at machinery, you know...)\n-- The Killer --Maya: ...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you lost consciousness when you were in the garden. Is that right? Maya: Yes. I think... I think it happened when the v-victim was stabbed. Phoenix: So then the person that carried you into the Inner Temple...? Judge: It could only have been the killer...! Godot: ... Maya: That's what I think, too. Phoenix: (So the killer carried Maya into the Inner Temple...)Maya: By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... ...... I don't know. Phoenix: (It looks like she doesn't have enough confidence. I think I need to gather some more information before I ask her again...)Press (after pressing third and fourth statements) Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something. Phoenix: You did? Maya: Yes... I felt like the killer was hiding the evidence for me... for my sake... Judge: Wh-What? Hiding it for you...!? Maya: Everyone knew that I was the only one at the Inner Temple that night. If Sister Bikini had come back and looked at the garden... Phoenix: ...She may have thought that you had done it... Judge: ...No, she definitely would have thought so. And you're saying that's why the killer... ...cleaned up the crime scene to make it look like nothing had happened...? Maya: Yes. I'm sure of it. Judge: Well, that's certainly an important piece of information! I want you to add that to your testimony! Maya: Yes, Your Honor... Adds statement \"I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.\"Press (after pressing third and fourth statements; subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: Naturally the killer must have done it, right? Maya: Yes, I think so... Phoenix: But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide. Maya: ...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something. Phoenix: You did?Maya: I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: They did it for your sake...? Maya: Well... If the body and the blood hadn't been removed... ...I would've immediately been the prime suspect, right? Judge: Yes, I suppose that's true. Phoenix: (Yeah, and if that happened, the body would have caused some other problems, too. If her real identity had come out right then, it would have been terrible. \"Master of Kurain Killed by Own Daughter!\" I don't think Maya would've been able to handle it...) Judge: But still... It's rather difficult to fathom the killer's motives. What reason is there to go through that much trouble to protect you...? Maya: ...Present Stone Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard.\"Maya: The torches were lit... And the body was gone.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The torches were lit? Maya: Yes. That's how I noticed that the whole scene had changed. Phoenix: (I'm going to say it was the killer who lit the torches... I mean, who else could it be?) Judge: The killer probably lit them since it'd be impossible to do any cover-up work in the dark. However, if that's true, there's one thing that still bothers me. Why did the killer go to the effort of moving the body? Phoenix: (That's true... It's hard to see how that would be of any advantage to the killer. The only one who would gain anything from that would be... ...the only person that was at the Inner Temple, Maya.) Maya: ... Judge: Very well... Let me hear some more about the condition of the crime scene.Maya: And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're saying the killer cleaned up the snow? (It did look really odd... The snow was removed in an unnatural-looking rectangular shape around the lantern...) Maya: There were a lot of shovels around the Inner Temple. But they're all really heavy. Way too heavy for me to use. Judge: ...An odd fellow indeed, this killer. Why on earth would anyone want to take snow away? Phoenix: Well there's one thing I can think of... Didn't you say that a lot of the victim's blood sprayed onto the snow? Maya: Y-Yeah... The area I collapsed in ended up being splattered. Phoenix: In other words... ...the killer's purpose was to hide the bloody snow. I think that's the most reasonable explanation. Judge: Hmm, perhaps... However, there's something that's bothering me. If the killer just wanted to hide the snow with blood on it... ...there was no need to remove that amount. Phoenix: (That's true... He could have scooped up just the snow that was stained with blood.) Judge: It looks like there are some mysteries behind this issue. Maya: ...But, I think this will help explain them!Maya: Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you're saying that you never saw the killer, right? Maya: Y-Yes. Phoenix: But earlier you very clearly stated that... ...you saw a man behind your attacker. Maya: ... Nick... I'm sorry...Phoenix: (The killer certainly went through a lot of trouble... Moving the body by pendulum, manipulating the crime scene... But for what purpose...? Why do all that? Maybe Maya knows more than she's letting on...)Phoenix: The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard. Then at the garden, the real scene of the crime... ...the snow that we suspect was covered in blood was scooped up and removed. It's reasonable to believe all this was done in an attempt to hide the true crime scene. However... There's still one matter that still seems somewhat odd.Godot: Oh? And what would that be?Phoenix: You must have figured it out by now, Mr. Godot... It's the message written in blood on the lantern.Godot: ...!Phoenix: It was written very clearly on the white stone lantern. \"Maya\"...Maya: Ah...Phoenix: If the killer was so motivated to protect Maya from suspicion... ...then why didn't they wipe the writing off the lantern? (Changed from [...then why didn't he wipe the writing off the lantern?] in the original release)Judge: Aaaaaaah! You're right! Order! Order! Order! B-But, Mr. Wright! Isn't it a fact that the killer was trying to cover up the crime scene...?Phoenix: Indeed. But it doesn't make much sense to move the body and remove the bloody snow... ...then not wipe off the most incriminating thing of all -- the bloody writing!Godot:Godot: But if that's the case... ...do you have an explanation for the killer's mysterious behavior? Why would this killer move the body and remove all that snow... ...but then leave the bloody writing on the lantern...?Phoenix: (I don't know what the killer's plan was... ...but it's a fact that the killer left the writing on the lantern. There must be a reason for it!)Judge: Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion. Why did the killer leave the message written in blood on the lantern?The killer wrote it. Phoenix: There's only one reason... And it's easier to spot than Sister Bikini in a bikini. It's because the killer is the one who wrote it! Judge: ...... Maya: ...... Godot: ...... Phoenix: ...Huh? Judge: ...Too bad, Mr. Wright. Don't you remember the testimony of that rather pathetic, vile woman? Dahlia: I think... I think I was stabbed. Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on Maya. Phoenix: ... Oh yeah... She did say that, didn't she...? Godot: Ha...! You and Dahlia... I'm not sure which one of you is more pathetic! Phoenix: Ugggghhh! Phoenix: (I've got to recall everything I've seen and heard up to this point! The answer is there somewhere!) Leads back to: \"Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion.\"To pin the crime on Maya. Phoenix: There's only one reason! One as obvious as Jean Armstrong in a thong on the Riviera! ...The killer was trying to pin the crime on Maya! Judge: ...... Maya: ...... Godot: ...... Phoenix: ...Huh? Maya: Umm, Nick. I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this, but... If the killer had meant to put the blame on me... ...then why didn't the killer leave the crime scene as it was? Phoenix: Oh... Judge: Once again, you've been pointing that finger where it doesn't belong! Phoenix: Ugggghhh! Phoenix: (I've got to recall everything I've seen and heard up to this point! The answer is there somewhere!) Leads back to: \"Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion.\"The killer didn't notice it. Leads to: \"...Prosecutor Godot. Earlier in this trial, you gave me some good advice.\"Phoenix: ...Prosecutor Godot. Earlier in this trial, you gave me some good advice. \"Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth.\"Godot: Maybe you're not as dumb as I thought.Phoenix: The real killer wanted to disguise the fact that a crime occurred there. If that's the case... They wouldn't have left the bloody writing on the stone lantern on purpose! Therefore, it must mean that they didn't notice it...Maya: B-But... That doesn't make any sense! The torches were all lit and everything... There's no way any normal person would miss something as glaring as that!Phoenix: You're right... There is no way any \"normal\" person would.Judge: What...? What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: There's only one person involved in this incident... ...who could have missed seeing the bloody writing altogether.Judge: And who would that be!? Who is the person that could have failed to notice the bloody writing!?Present Godot profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Godot...\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: ...I think I'll leave some bloody writing when I die, too. I'll write... \"Wright Left\". Phoenix: H-Huh? Judge: You have no idea what you're talking about, do you? Phoenix: (Is he telling me I need to leave the courtroom...?) Godot: Hey, Trite... You can play after the trial is over! Phoenix: (I'm sure I'm on the right track! I've just got to think more carefully about all that's happened up to this point!) Leads back to: \"There's only one person involved in this incident...\"Phoenix: Mr. Godot... This is what you said yesterday...Godot: My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.Judge: You can't see everything!? Is that correct, Mr. Godot!?Godot: ...Phoenix: This lantern was submitted as evidence today. I would like the court to think back to the moment it was first presented.Judge: Th-This lantern... There's something written on it! Wh-Why... It's written in blood!Godot: Hmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!Phoenix: ...Mr. Godot. Just admit it. There are certain colors you can't see... Correct?Godot: ...Phoenix: You can't see red on a white background, can you? ...That's right. We went through this once before. During the poisoning case at Tr\u00e9s Bien...Godot: This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. And somehow spilled coffee on.Judge: There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot: Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge: Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot: That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix: You could see the coffee on the white apron... ...But you couldn't see the ketchup. Because it was red.Godot: ... Ha...! It's strange... In a black and white photo, those letters would have appeared black to me... I wonder... Why am I the only one that can't see them...?Judge: S-So then... Mr. Godot! Are you admitting it!? Are you admitting that you can't see the red writing on the lantern!? (Changed from [Are you admitting that you couldn't see the red writing on the lantern!?] in the original release)Godot: ...Hey, gramps. Didn't you know? That's the reason why I don't drink red tea!Phoenix: (I wasn't sure about it until now, but... I just can't believe it... Prosecutor Godot is the murderer! But... There's no going back now. I've finally figured out the truth...!) ...Mr. Godot. The defense at this time formally accuses you. You are the murderer of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, also known as Ms. Misty Fey!Judge: It's hard to believe this may be true. However... ...once again Mr. Wright has brought up a disquieting fact about you!Godot: Ha...! Just make sure you don't fill out the indictment in red ink, gramps. Come on... How does a little graffiti make me into the killer?Phoenix: ...!Godot: Besides, it's not like it's my name that's written there.Phoenix:Phoenix: I'm certain that the killer wasn't able to see the color red!Godot: This is rich. Do go on, Trite.Phoenix: The answer is right there at the crime scene. In the snow...Judge: The snow? How so?Phoenix: Well, for example, why did the killer move all that snow...? Your Honor, you said it yourself. If they wanted to hide the bloody snow, why not take out just that area?Judge: Yes, why didn't he take just that area...? Ah! C-Could it be...!? (Changed from [Yes, why didn't they take just that area...? Ah! C-Could it be...!?] in the original release)Phoenix: Yes. The killer couldn't see the red blood that had seeped into the snow. And so, he had to remove all of the snow! He couldn't be sure of where the blood had landed, so he removed the whole area!Godot:Godot: Isn't it more likely that the killer couldn't see the blood because it was dark?Phoenix: ...Not a chance. The torches were all lit. He would have been able to see just fine. (Changed from [The torches were all lit. They would have been able to see fine.] in the original release)Judge: ......It seems... ...that once again, this trial has taken an unexpected turn, to say the least. Can you explain this, Mr. Godot!????:Maya: W-Wait! Wait just a minute! (Changed from [W-Wait! Just wait a minute!] in the original release)Phoenix: Maya!Judge: Wh-What is it, witness?Maya: M-Mr. Godot... isn't the killer...! After all, he didn't even come to the Inner Temple... ...until 2 days after the murder took place! He didn't show up until after that old bridge got fixed up!Godot:Godot: Maya...Maya: ...!Godot: You can't testify to something like that.Maya: Why...? What do you mean!? I may not look it, but I'm-- Eeeeeeeek!!Godot: After the murder happened... you didn't even exist.Judge: She didn't...? I'm afraid I don't follow...Godot: Are you senile, old man? We established this just a little while ago. After the murder, this witness was unconscious for a long time. Because she was channeling Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge: Oh... That's right...Maya: P-Please, Your Honor! Let me add to my testimony! ...Nick! Please listen to me...!Phoenix: ...... (Maya... Do you plan to cover for Godot no matter what the cost...? If that's the case, then I've got no choice.) ...Your Honor! Let's hear her testimony. If it means we're going to hear the whole truth, I say we should not silence her.Godot: Ha...! Nicely done, Trite.Judge: Very well, let's hear the witness's testimony. Please tell us what happened at the Inner Temple after the murder.Maya: Yes, sir. After I woke up, I began channeling and my spirit \"left me\", as it were. But that little girl was there at the Inner Temple, too!Witness Testimony-- After the Incident --Maya: Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night! The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone. The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room. That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time! He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!Judge: Who is this \"Pearly\"...?Maya: That's my little cousin! Pearl Fey.Judge: Hmm... So when did you hear about this?Maya: Oh, just a while ago... When I was in the medical office.Judge: I'm terribly sorry... But what you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.Maya: Whaaaat!? Come on! Pearly would never tell a lie! She's a way more honest person than I'll ever be!Phoenix: (Real smart, Maya. You always know the best things to say when you're under oath...)Godot: Ha...! The prosecution has no objection. We believe the witness.Judge: M-Mr. Godot!Godot: Let's just move on to the cross-examination... If the defense has no objections...Judge: Th-This is highly unusual, but... Well, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: ... Let's get this cross-examination started.Godot: ...Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- After the Incident --Maya: Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So where did do you think Pearls slept that night? Maya: In the spare prep room next to the Training Hall, I guess. There's a rule that you can't enter the Training Hall during an acolyte's training. Judge: But even so, why did she go to the Inner Temple in the first place? Phoenix: It seems that Pearls became very worried about Maya. Maya: She knew that the spiritual training I was about to undergo was very intense. Phoenix: (Pearls was supposed to channel Dahlia Hawthorne... But she couldn't do it. That's why she headed to the Inner Temple. However, Dahlia Hawthorne was already there... ...possessing the body of Elise Deauxnim.)Maya: The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She searched the entire Inner Temple side, end to end...? Maya: Well, you see... Pearly gets pretty scared when she's alone. And there weren't that many places to look... She says that she even went back and forth several times. Phoenix: The Inner Temple side has two structures: the Training Hall and a spare prep room... Maya: And there's also a storage shack, I think... That's about it. Phoenix: (There was a storage shack, too?) ...Pearls was looking for other people, right? Phoenix: Would she have really examined a storage shack all that carefully...? Maya: ... Well, if it was me, that would be the first place I would investigate! Judge: Hmm... So that means it's possible that someone may have been hiding in the storage shack.Maya: The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Pearls didn't hear the sound of them working on the bridge? Maya: What do you mean? Phoenix: I was just wondering why she would stay in the prep room. If it was me, I'd at least go out and wait at the foot of the bridge. Maya: ...Oh. Well, Pearly said she was sleeping at the time. She said she was so scared during the night... ...that she couldn't sleep well and woke up a bunch of times. Judge: Poor little girl... All alone like that... Godot: Well, we know that she had at least one friend in the Sacred Cavern. ...Dahlia Hawthorne, who was busy battling with the trick lock... Phoenix: (She couldn't let anyone see her... So she wouldn't have shown herself to Pearls.) Godot: What happened after the bridge was finally fixed...?Maya: That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So it was your first time on the Inner Temple side, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hmm? That's funny. Am I imagining things, or did the defense ask me a question? Judge: ...Mr. Wright, please save your questions for the witness. Phoenix: \"What you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.\" Those are your words. ...Your Honor. Judge: ... Touch\u00e9, Mr. Wright. Oh well... What do you have to say, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hot nights and even hotter coffee... That's what I always say. If it hadn't have been for this case, I never would have visited there. A freezing cold temple in the mountains... I think I'll pass! Phoenix: (So he had never visited Hazakura Temple or the Inner Temple, huh...?) Godot: ...Ha! You want to say something, Trite? Phoenix: (In any case, I have to find a crack in Godot's armor! While I cross-examine Maya, that is...) Judge: Very well, please go on with your testimony. After fixing the bridge, the policemen came over to the Inner Temple side, right? Maya: Yes! Then Mr. Godot...Press (after selecting \"Godot's investigation\" upon pressing fifth statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: So it was your first time on the Inner Temple side, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hmm? That's funny. Am I imagining things, or did the defense ask me a question? Judge: ...Mr. Wright, please save your questions for the witness. Phoenix: \"What you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.\" Those are your words. ...Your Honor. Judge: ... Touch\u00e9, Mr. Wright. Oh well... What do you have to say, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hot nights and even hotter coffee... That's what I always say. If it hadn't have been for this case, I never would have visited there. A freezing cold temple in the mountains... I think I'll pass! Phoenix: (So he had never visited Hazakura Temple or the Inner Temple, huh...?) Godot: ...Ha! You want to say something, Trite? Phoenix: (It's just like I thought. Godot is lying! If his first visit to the Inner Temple really was after the incident.. He shouldn't know about that piece of evidence!) Judge: Very well, please go on with your testimony. After fixing the bridge, the policemen came over to the Inner Temple side, right? Maya: Yes! Then Mr. Godot...Present Hanging Scroll (after selecting \"Godot's investigation\" upon pressing fifth statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Mr. Godot.\"Maya: He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: H-He cheered her up...? Maya: That's what Pearly said... She said he was a very nice older gentleman. Thank you for looking after my cousin, Mr. Godot! Judge: And here I was thinking you were nothing more than a coffee-addict. Godot: Ha...! Cut it out... ...You're making me blush. Phoenix: (This guy is really beginning to get on my nerves... In more ways than one...) Godot: The truth is there aren't that many places to look on the Inner Temple side. The policemen were all busy going over the garden with fine-toothed combs. So I decided to carry out an investigation in my own way... Godot-style! Judge: I'm the same way. I like to hand down verdicts in my own way, Judge-style! Phoenix: (Hmm, maybe I should ask some questions, Phoenix-Style...) Forget it Judge: How about it, Mr. Wright? Do you have anything to add? Phoenix: No. I give up... This whole Phoenix-style thing, I mean. Judge: It seems... ...this phrase has become overused, so I'm putting an end to it... Judge-style. Phoenix: (Then let it go already!) Leads back to cross-examination Cheering Pearls up Phoenix: So you cheered Pearls up? Godot: When I found that little girl... ...the first thing she asked about was her cousin, Maya Fey. Maya: Really...? Godot: The bridge had burned down and she was huddled up in that tiny shack with no heat... Even though she must have had a truly terrifying night out there... ...she asked about you before she said a thing about herself. Maya: P-Pearly... Godot: I noticed that you weren't anywhere on the Inner Temple side. But... I couldn't find it in me to tell her that. So I gave her my last cup. With milk and sugar... To hide the bitterness of the harsh truth. Judge: Wh-What a sweet story... *sniffle* Phoenix: (He had a thermos of coffee? Why doesn't that surprise me?) Leads back to cross-examination Godot's investigation Phoenix: You said that you conducted an investigation of your own. Did you find anything? Godot: It looks like my investigation went about as well as yours, Trite. After all, I did miss the bloody writing on the lantern. Phoenix: (Well, I didn't miss it, so speak for yourself, Goggles!) Godot: The only odd thing I discovered was the beauty in the Training Hall. Phoenix: Beauty...? Godot: ...Misty Fey, naturally. Clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes. Phoenix: (Western tastes...? Could he find a stranger way to describe gravy...?) Judge: So from there you headed for the prep room? Phoenix: ...... (Wait a sec... What did Godot say just now? I think I just found his proverbial weak spot!) Leads back to cross-examinationPhoenix: (There's only one thing of any importance here... Where was Godot when the murder was taking place? He must have already been at the Inner Temple when it happened. Otherwise, he couldn't have killed Elise Deauxnim!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the provided materials.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the testimonies given by Maya. The testimonies are:\n\nTestimony 0: Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!\nTestimony 1: The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone.\nTestimony 2: The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room.\nTestimony 3: That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!\nTestimony 4: He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!\n\nNow, the evidence list includes several items. Let's look through them for contradictions. \n\nOne key piece of evidence is the Burnt Letter (Evidence 18), which is Morgan Fey's letter instructing Pearl to channel Dahlia Hawthorne. But maybe that's not directly related to the testimonies here.\n\nAnother critical evidence is the Crystal Sphere (16), found near Dusky Bridge with blood. But how does that relate to the testimonies?\n\nWait, looking at Testimony 3: \"That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!\" But there's evidence that Godot couldn't have arrived after the bridge was fixed because he was involved in the crime before that. Wait, but in the cross-examination, there's a point where Godot's first visit to the Inner Temple is questioned. The Hanging Scroll (Evidence 4) has Misty Fey's image covered in gravy, and Godot mentions the \"hue and aroma of Western tastes\" (referring to the gravy). This suggests he knew about the scroll's state before the bridge was fixed, implying he was there earlier. But according to Testimony 3, Godot arrived after the bridge was fixed. \n\nWait, the Hanging Scroll's description says that Godot described it as 'clad in stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes', which refers to the gravy. If Godot arrived for the first time after the bridge was fixed (Testimony 3), he wouldn't have known about the gravy-stained scroll unless he was there before, during the crime. Therefore, the testimony that Godot arrived for the first time after the bridge was fixed contradicts the evidence that he knew about the scroll's condition, which was altered during the crime. But the specific evidence here would be the Hanging Scroll (4) contradicting Testimony 3.\n\nWait, but looking at the provided evidences, Evidence 4 (Hanging Scroll) mentions that Godot described it with the gravy. If Godot arrived for the first time after the bridge was fixed (Testimony 3), how did he know about the gravy on the scroll unless he was there earlier? So the Hanging Scroll (4) contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair is evidence 4 (Hanging Scroll) and testimony 3."

Bonny: *sigh* It's so much WORK pretending to be cute and sweet. Apollo: (Isn't that Bonny?) Retinz: Hey, bunny! Wait for me! Apollo: (And the Ratings Rajah?) What did we have to hide for, Athena? Athena: Because I heard something funny. There was something off in their voices... Apollo: (Oh, right. Athena's super-sensitive hearing...) Bonny: Those lawyers are poking around, trying to stir up trouble. Should I be worried? Retinz: Relax! I didn't say anything to the police, and I won't say anything to them, either. Bonny: You better not! Or you're gonna get it! POW! Right in the kisser! Apollo: What the...? Is it just me or does Bonny seem kinda different from before? Athena: Apollo, shhh! Bonny: I'm sick and tired of this whole investigation! All I want is Trucy's head on a platter! Retinz: Heh heh. Leave everything to me, babe. Don't forget the power of mass media! TV can accomplish anything! I'll make sure Trucy gets much worse than a guilty verdict! Bonny: Hmph. I can't wait to see that girl crying and begging for mercy. Retinz: You really hate Trucy, don't you, bunny? Bonny: I hate her. I LOATHE her! I can't stand that Trucy Wright! Just because she's a little good at magic, she thinks she's all that! So this is exactly what that sniveling brat deserves! Apollo: (Hey! What the heck...?!) Bonny: If you mess this up, you're gonna really be sorry. You hear me? I'll crush you flat. Like a cockroach under my foot! Retinz: Oh, you KYOOT widdle thing! You're so adooorwable when you're thwowing a fit! OW! OW! My foot! C-Can't you take a joke? Bonny: C'mon! Grab my things! We're leaving! Retinz: D'awwwwwww. Lead the hippity-hopping way, my little bun-bun! Athena: ............ Apollo: ............ Athena: Wh-What was that absolutely revolting scene all about? Apollo: I guess the entertainment industry attracts all kind of eccentrics... But that conversation... It set off every red flag in the book. Athena: You said it! I smell \"plot\" with a capital \"P.U.\"! Apollo: Hmm... Retinz claims he was at the TV station at the time of the incident... ...and we saw Bonny onstage ourselves. Athena: Hey, Apollo, I have an idea. Why don't we pay Take-2 TV a visit? We can check up on the Rating [sic] Rajah's alibi while we're there. Apollo: Sounds like a plan. Stage Examine Backstage \"Understage\" sign Apollo: The stairs to the Abyss... This is how we get to the understage passage. Detention Center Present Stage Lift #2 Trucy: This is one of the stage lifts I moved in the understage passage during the show. Apollo: I can't believe you were able to move something this heavy all by yourself. Trucy: Well, I couldn't disappoint the audience, now could I! Athena: That's some real determination! You're a true pro, Trucy! Trucy: Oh, it was nothing, really. My granddaddy once finished an entire show after throwing out his back on stage! Apollo: Really? Now THAT'S magic! April 27Take-2 TV - Studio Athena: Yikes! Look at this place! Apollo: There's so much going on at once, it's making my head spin. Athena: Take a look at that screen! And listen to those hosts! \"Magical Murder! Live audience witnesses shocking skewering! Seventeen-Year-Old Magician, Trucy Wright! (Changed from [17-Year-Old Magician, Trucy Wright!] in the original release) See exclusive, unedited footage of the heinous crime -- complete and uncut!\" We can't let them broadcast that! Trucy will get tried in the court of public opinion! Apollo: Well, I doubt we can stop them from airing it... ...but we can prove her innocence in a real court of law! No matter what garbage they report on TV, we can set the record straight at the trial! Examine Slot machine or roulette wheel Apollo: A slot machine and roulette wheel, huh. They really went all in with the gambling theme. Athena: It looks like that slot machine really works! I've always wanted to give gambling a try! Apollo: It's not worth it. Besides, you're not even old enough to gamble in most states yet. Athena: That's all right. I get to experience it enough in court... ...guessing whether you'll win or lose the case on any given day. Apollo: Thanks for the vote of confidence. Athena: Don't worry, Apollo. I only bet on winners and I haven't lost yet! Screen Apollo: Look at that logo above the screen. \"Scandal Gamble Gambit!\" Is that the title of this show? Athena: Yup. Haven't you ever seen it? They present scandalous rumors about celebrities... ...and then people bet on whether the rumors are true or not. Apollo: Ugh... o it's just another tasteless TV show. Today's scandal is... \"Tragedy on stage! Did Trucy Wright cause an accident, or did she commit murder?!\" It looks like \"murder\" is in the lead. Apollo: Well, I say neither. Athena: Then we'll just have to create a third option tomorrow -- in court! Workstation Apollo: This must be a video production workstation of some sort. Athena: Hmm... That coffee cup looks awfully familiar. Staff: Yeah, that's where Mr. Retinz always sits. He's very hands-on, you know. You'll always find him on the set of his projects. Apollo: But he was here at the station during the magic show, right? Staff: Yeah, well, he had two shows going at once this morning. He had his regular program to oversee here, so he couldn't be at the Penrose. Athena: So you can vouch for him -- that he was here at the station during the magic show? Staff: What, like an alibi? Sure can. He was definitely here. Still, after a while he couldn't stand being away from the Penrose, it seems. As soon as his part was over here, he took a taxi to the theater... ...but he apparently didn't get there until after that thing had already occurred. Apollo: (Sounds like he has a rock solid alibi...) Sitting staff member Athena: I wonder what that guy sitting down there is doing. Apollo: Hmm... It looks like he's reading that script he's holding. Staff: WHAAAT?! Are you serious?! Those two are gonna break up?! What?! And the series is going on hiatus 'cause the cartoonist is sick?! No way! Athena: .........I think he's reading a comic book he's hiding in his script. Apollo: If you're gonna goof off on set, that's a pretty bold way to do it... Cameraman Apollo: We're looking into the incident that happened at the magic show this morning... Staff: Oh, that? Yeah, I was the cameraman for that. Apollo: Can you tell us anything about what you saw? Staff: ...Bonny was supes adorbs! Heh heh... Apollo: Um... that's not exactly what I... Staff: I couldn't get enough of her! I filmed her the whole time! Got some primo footage, if I do say so myself! Heh heh! Apollo: (I'd better quit before he decides to share what he intends to do with said footage...) Staff member next to roulette wheel Apollo: Pardon me. I know you're busy right now... Staff: What are you guys? Street? Apollo: (\"Street\"? Does that mean \"people off the street\" or something?) We're Trucy Wright's lawyers. Staff: Oh, okay. Lawyers. Got it. Well, whaddaya want? Apollo: (He must be REALLY busy. He hasn't even looked this way.) We're investigating the incident that occurred at the magic show this morning... ...and we heard that Roger Retinz was in charge of that program. Staff: Yeah, that's right. The guy hates magic, but the show was all his idea. Just between you and me, I think it was Bonny that egged him on. Apollo: Egged him on? How so? Staff: I saw the two of them together -- you know, walking along arm in arm. I bet she sweet-talked him into doing the program because she wanted the work. She hasn't been selling very well on her own, apparently. Apollo: I see... Staff: Oh, hey, if you're looking into the incident, I guess you'd want the show footage, right? It's on the disc in my back pocket. If you want it, go ahead and fish it out. Apollo: Wow. Thank you very much. (He turned out to be surprisingly helpful.) Show Footage disc retrieved from the staff member's back pocket. Staff member next to roulette wheel (subsequent times) Staff: Huh? You want something else? Apollo: No, uh, we're good. Thanks for your help earlier. Athena: That's a pretty big back pocket you have to be able to fit a whole disc in there. Staff: Yeah, I can fit all kinds of things in there! It's pretty handy for when I have to be out on location. Apollo: So what other kinds of things do you put in there? Staff: ........... Apollo: Sir? Staff: Um, maybe I'd better not tell you... Apollo: Huh? (Now I really want to know...!) Apollo: Well, I guess we got just about everything we can out of this place. It looks like Retinz's alibi is pretty airtight. (But if that's true... then who could've killed Mr. Reus?) After examining workstation and staff member next to roulette wheel: Apollo: Well, I guess we got just about everything we can out of this place. It looks like Retinz's alibi is pretty airtight. (But if that's true... then who could've killed Mr. Reus?) After examining clipboard in Penrose Theater - Dressing Room and examining workstation and staff member next to roulette wheel in Take-2 TV - Studio: Athena: Looks like we're pretty much done here. Should we go back to the office? We can get a snack and talk over our plan of attack. Apollo: Sounds good to me. April 27Wright Anything Agency Apollo: Wh-What in the world...? What's going on here?! Athena: All these stickers say \"REPOSSESSED\"... Apollo: Who did this? Who's responsible for this?! ???: Whoa, now! This is a restricted area, champ! No trespassing! Apollo: \"Trespassing\"?! But this is our office! You're the one who's trespassing! Retinz: Enough with the lip, boy. Don't tell me you forgot about your debt? Athena: Wh-What are you talking about?! Retinz: I'm just abiding by the contract. If the agency can't pay me, I have every right to seize its property, am I right? Apollo: (Just like that?! We haven't even had a chance to take this to trial!) Retinz: Heh heh. If you're gonna be mad, shouldn't Trucy be the one you're mad at? I told you. It serves you right for getting involved with those Gramaryes! Apollo: (Why, you dirty, rotten--!) Examine Anywhere Apollo: These stupid stickers are all over the place! Retinz: Well, would you look at that? There's something I forgot to put a sticker on! Apollo: Hey! Don't put one on me! Talk Office seizure Apollo: What are you going to do with all of our stuff?! Retinz: Sell it, of course. Every last bit of it. That's why I'm seizing everything. And I'll take this little office of yours, too. Athena: You think you can just waltz in here and do whatever you want?! Retinz: Indeed I do! Unless you Wright Whatever Warehouse jokers got three million ready? Athena: Nnrgh... Retinz: That a no, then? Because I gotta recoup my money somehow. After all, the entire program went south because of Trucy. It's called \"liability for compensation.\" And this infantile agency is the liable party! Apollo: Why, you black-hearted... Athena: Hey, Apollo. What about the crooked clipboard? Apollo: It's no good. We don't have any proof that Retinz was behind it. Athena: Darn... Retinz: Heh heh. You're gonna have to do better than that, folks! Looks like the famed Mr. Wright left behind nothing but incompetent newbs to run things. Apollo: (No way... He was counting on Mr. Wright to be away for this plan of his...? What a two-bit thug! We'll show him!) Retinz: Ha ha! There's the sugar! That expression! It's priceless! So, how does it feel to lose the precious office your boss left you in charge of? Retinz [on cue card]: SAY SOMETHING DUMB!! Apollo: Grrrrrrr... Retinz: Now, not to rub it in or anything... ...but I think you should know where you stand right now. Apollo: (Oh, man. What now?!) Where we stand (appears after \"Office seizure\") Leads to: \"Here. Have a gander.\" Present Clipboard Retinz: Huh? What's this? You want me to look at something? Athena: Don't show him that now, Apollo. He'll just try to take it from you. Apollo: Yeah, good point. (Better play our cards closer to our chests.) Retinz: What do you want, a handout? Fine, fine. Here. Now go away, kids -- ya bother me. Athena: Ooh, Apollo! The humiliation! He's treating us like beggars! Apollo: If it bothers you so much, why do you have your palm stretched out? Anything else Retinz: What, you want me to repo that, too? I'll take anything you wanna give me as collateral. Apollo: Er, no. It's not for you. (I'd better be careful not to show him any important evidence...) Retinz: Here. Have a gander. TV: The trial of young, up-and-coming magician Trucy Wright is scheduled for tomorrow. We're here, just outside the office of the suspect, hoping for an exclusive peak inside. Apollo: What?! Is this LIVE?! Athena: Ahh! Apollo, look! There's a sea of reporters outside! TV: Oh! A questionable-looking pair are peeking out the window at this very moment! Our viewers at home can see for themselves their vicious, brutal expressions... Athena: Yellow journalism at its finest... Retinz: And that's the way it is. The majority of the public already thinks Trucy is guilty. They saw the whole thing happen with their own eyes during the show's live broadcast. Everybody in the country is against you! Apollo: N-No way... Retinz: No office... No allies... Are you sure you still want to represent that girl? Apollo: O-Of course we do! We believe in her innocence! Retinz: Heh heh. Go ahead, think what you want -- it's a free country! Just know that you'll be the biggest losers in the end. In the meantime, feel free to keep on flopping around like the dying fish you are. Now then, you gotta be outta here by tomorrow. Take in this cozy little office tonight while you still can! Heh heh. Hang loose, baby! Apollo: I... I can't believe we let Mr. Wright's office get placed under seizure! Of all the--! Athena: This is just ridiculous! *CRASH!* Athena: Eeeeek! Widget: Look out! Gallery: Clear out! We don't want murderers here! Athena: HEY! If it's a fight you want, I'll take you on! C'MON! Gallery: YIKES! Let's get outta here before we get killed, too! Athena: *huff, huff, huff, huff* I can't believe this is happening...! Apollo: (We have to do something to protect ourselves... and fast...)\u00a0! ............It's Mr. Wright! Phone: ......*beep* Phoenix: A-A-Apollo!!! I got your messages! How is she?! Is Trucy okay?! S-She's not crying, is she?! Does she have a lawyer?! Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright!!! It's all a giant mess! Poor Trucy...! And the office...! Our office...! Phoenix: A-Apollo...? Okay, okay. We'd better both take a deep breath... Phoenix: Wow... I see... And he's saying you have to be out by tomorrow? Apollo: I'm so sorry, Mr. Wright... I wish there was something I could've done... Phoenix: This... is quite the mess, isn't it? Even if I left right now, I wouldn't be there in time for the trial tomorrow. I'm sorry, Apollo, but I need you to handle this for me. Apollo: O-Of course! We can handle the defense, but the office... Phoenix: It's too soon to give up on that! Apollo: What do you mean? Phoenix: The contract only addresses Trucy's liability if she causes the show to be canceled. So you just have to prove in court tomorrow that it wasn't Trucy's fault. Apollo: ...Hey, you're right! Phoenix: So everything depends on your winning that trial tomorrow. Trucy's fate... and the fate of our office. It's all riding on your shoulders, Apollo. Apollo: ...I-I know... (I-I'll be... fine... right?) Phoenix: ............Apollo! Apollo: ! Phoenix: I've been watching you grow over these past two years. That's why I can say, with absolute confidence... that you'll be fine. Apollo: R-Really? Phoenix: I've seen you earn victory after victory in some pretty dicey situations... ...and guide Athena -- helping her along her way, too. That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo. Apollo: Th-Thank you, Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Good luck tomorrow! Apollo: ...Thank you! I'm... I'm fine! Everything will be fine! Phoenix: You can call me anytime if you feel you need to, but... Apollo: ...But I'll be fine on my own, right? Yes, I think so, too. I can do this! Phoenix: That's the spirit. Give it your best out there, Apollo! Phone: ......*beep* Apollo: ............ Athena: What is it, Apollo? What are you smiling about? Apollo: Who, me? I-It's nothing... (Mr. Wright believes in me. I-I can't let him down!) We have to win this trial, Athena! Athena: I couldn't agree more! And I'll do everything in my power to help! Apollo: (Our opponent tomorrow... \"Prosecutor Sahdmadhi,\" huh? Why now of all times...? Still, I don't care who it is! I can't afford to let my guard down for anyone!) Anime cutsceme Nahyuta: O restless wandering soul of the dead... Ema: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Sorry to disturb you, but... I figured I should tell you... the lead attorney's been decided. It's... Apollo Justice. Nahyuta: Apollo... Justice. To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during fingerprinting session Apollo: Doesn't look like there are any prints here. Fingerprint already examined Apollo: I already checked this print. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: (Nothing particularly interesting here.)\nThe Magical Turnabout Image Gallery TranscriptPart 1 Part 2April 28District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3Apollo: I'm fine... I'm fine... I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine...Trucy: Is Apollo okay? He's been muttering to himself all morning...Athena: He's been like that since yesterday. Guess the pressure of today's trial is getting to him.Trucy: Poor Polly... He's really tearing himself up over all of this.Athena: Get it together, Apollo!Apollo: Yikes! Athena! Wh-When did you get here?Athena: Try to relax a little bit, will you? You're getting yourself way too worked up.Apollo: Y-Yeah... But I'm all right. I'm fine!Athena: You know, I did a little digging on this Nahyuta Sahdmadhi guy... He's apparently not your run-of-the-mill prosecutor.Apollo: ...Oh, yeah? What did you find out?Athena: Well, they say he wields an incredible power... ...to accurately read a trial's karma and its ultimate fate.Apollo: What is THAT supposed to mean?Athena: I don't have all the details, but apparently... ...he can foresee how the arguments will go, and even lead his opposition. So the defense basically ends up going in whatever direction he has in his head.Apollo: ...Man, this isn't going to be a cake walk, if that's true...Athena: Ema DID say she'd talk to him for us, though. Here's hoping that went well.Apollo: (In any case, it sounds like he's going to keep us on our toes.)That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo.Apollo: (Mr. Wright is putting his faith in me. I can't let him down now!) I'm fine... I'm fine. I'm fine!Trucy: There he goes again. It's almost like he's chanting a prayer.Apollo: I'm fine... I'm fine... I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine!Athena: If you say so, Apollo...Guard: The trial will start momentarily. Is the defense ready?Apollo: Yes! WE'RE FINE! (Trucy's fate and the fate of the agency rest on this trial... This is it, Justice! If ever there was a time to shine, it's now!)April 28, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge: Court is now in session for the trial of Trucy Wright.Apollo: The defense is ready, Your Honor.Nahyuta: ............Judge: And the prosecution?Nahyuta: ............Judge: Um, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi...?Nahyuta: ...A thousand pardons. It was rude of me to keep you waiting. I was praying for the victim.Judge: Oh! Praying... Yes. Yes, I see. You're a Khura'inist monk, correct, Prosecutor?Nahyuta: ...Yes, that is correct. I am but a lowly monk from the Kingdom of Khura'in. I beg in advance for the forgiveness and kind patience of everyone here in this court. I am unfamiliar with the proceedings of this country, and may make many blunders.Athena: Hmm... He seems like such a gentle-mannered soul, doesn't he?Apollo: (I wonder if Ema had a chance to talk with him about Trucy...)Judge: Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your opening statement, if you would.Nahyuta: ...Certainly. In the name of the Holy Mother... ...I vow to guide the victim's soul to a land of eternal peace known as the Twilight Realm. Now, let the last rites of the victim begin.Apollo: (Nahyuta Sahdmadhi... He's really been making a name for himself apparently, but... ...that nickname -- \"Last Rites Prosecutor\"... I wonder how that will come into play today.)Nahyuta: The incident took place in the middle of a spectacular magic show. The accused performed a magic trick in which she thrust a sword into a coffin... ...a coffin from which the body of the victim then spilled out -- dead from a fatal stabbing. The victim's name was Manov Mistree, otherwise known as \"The Great Mr. Reus.\" His blood was found on the sword that was used during the magic trick.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge: So his death was just an unfortunate accident?Nahyuta: It is only natural for one to assume as such, Your Honor... ...however, it was no mere accident, but rather... a homicide. The prosecution's position is thus: that this was a murder made to look like an accident.Judge: I see. And you believe this crime was committed by the defendant?Nahyuta: ...After a thorough consideration of all possible scenarios... ...I, unfortunately, had no other choice but to conclude as much.Apollo: ! (So that's how it's going to be, huh...)Athena: I guess Ema couldn't convince him after all...Judge: ...Very well. And now, let us hear from the defense.Apollo: Naturally, we maintain that the defendant is innocent, Your Honor.Nahyuta: ...If the defense wouldn't mind... ...could you please explain your reasoning?Apollo: My reasoning...? Um, well... I would have to say that my main reason is because... I believe in the defendant.Nahyuta: ...I see. So you find it difficult to come up with anything more concrete than that, do you? What a fine demonstration of the fact that you are indeed a lawyer of putrid mind.Apollo: ...\"P-Putrid mind\"...?Judge: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Apollo: E-Excuse me, but I don--Nahyuta:Apollo: !Nahyuta:Judge: ...If you don't mind my asking, Prosecutor, what was that you were just chanting?Nahyuta: A sutra of the Holy Mother that guides those of tainted soul toward enlightenment. It is a Khura'inist incantation to awaken the foolish from their fruitless slumber. Fitting for a lawyer who indulges in such fancy as the innocence of the accused.Judge: I-I see... So basically, you're asking the defense to \"get real\"?Nahyuta: Allow me these few words, defense. It is my duty as a monk to punish sinners, and to guide victims' souls to the Twilight Realm. Should you show repentance and admit to the accused's guilt now, no harm will come to you. But... should you interfere with my sacred last rites for the victim... ...then I shall cast you down into the pit of hell, along with Trucy Wright!Apollo: ............N-Now wait just one minute here! \"Putrid\"?! \"Pit of hell\"?! Is that any way to address someone in a court of law?!Judge: Hmm... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... That may be the way you conduct trials in Khura'in... ...but I would appreciate it if you would refrain from such charged language here.Nahyuta: Your Honor, that was but a Khura'inist sermon for those who have strayed from the path. Harsh words are often necessary to admonish contemptible deviants who cannot see reason.Judge: O-Oh, I see... I-I didn't realize...Athena: I guess they really do hate defense attorneys in Khura'in, huh. Even still, that was way, way over the top as far as verbal abuse goes.Apollo: And the trial's only just begun...Judge: Hmm... Well, defense, I suppose the way a prosecutor does things varies by country. Why don't we look at this as cross-cultural exchange and try to be open-minded about it?Apollo: What?!Judge: Bailiff, please bring in the first witness.Ema: MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCHApollo: (Uh-oh. I thought she'd \"said goodbye\" to the Snackoos...)Ema: MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCHJudge: ............Detective Skye! The courtroom is no place for gorging yourself!Ema: ......What's wrong with having a little snack? Girl's gotta eat, right?!Athena: She, uh, seems a little stressed out.Nahyuta: Detective Skye, your testimony, please.Ema: Y-Yeah, about that... I just want to state for the record that... I believe Trucy Wright is innocent!Judge: I-I'm sorry?!Nahyuta: ...Detective Skye, this path you seek to follow is misguided. Giving the wrongdoer false hope will only deepen her despair in the end.Ema: But I...!Nahyuta: Let it go, and move on. Acts which go against your duty will earn you divine punishment from the Holy Mother.Ema: ! ............ MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH CHEW CHEW CHEW... ...Fine. I don't know about the \"divine\" part, but I get the \"punishment\" bit loud and clear...Athena: I guess Ema got assigned tons of paperwork or something for sticking up for Trucy...Apollo: She and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi don't seem to get along very well, do they?Nahyuta: Shall we continue? The prosecution contends that the accused had a clear motive. The evidence, if you would, Detective Skye.Ema: All right... Please take a look at this poster. It's a Troupe Gramarye poster from thirteen years ago.Apollo: Hm? Is it just me or is it a little different from the one in Ms. Wright's dressing room?Ema: This is a revised version of that poster.Apollo: This one says \"CANCELED\" under Mr. Reus.Ema: That's right. Mr. Reus left the troupe after the first version of the poster was printed. Take a look at Mr. Reus's right forearm, near his elbow. See the big scar there? He apparently got that when he made a mistake while practicing a magic trick.Apollo: (Ouch. That's quite a scar...)Ema: Because of the accident, Magnifi Gramarye concluded Mr. Reus was too unskilled. Just before the show was to open, Magnifi announced Mr. Reus wouldn't be appearing. But in defiance of Magnifi's decision, Mr. Reus tried to go on stage anyway. This, in turn, caused Magnifi to oust Mr. Reus from the troupe on the spot.Judge: He kicked Mr. Reus out? That seems rather extreme. Did he really have to go that far?Nahyuta: When it came to magic, Troupe Gramarye was so passionate... ...or should I say \"extreme,\" about it that it caused problems for them from time to time.Judge: Hmm... Yes, they even caused this court a mountain of trouble with their extreme antics.Nahyuta: And now, the troupe's successor has committed a murder. It seems the troupe's rare talent was inherited by the right person after all. A putrid talent for criminality.Apollo: ........................Judge: ............Y-You sound rather extreme yourself, Prosecutor.Nahyuta: Criminals with impure souls do not deserve sympathy, Your Honor.Ema: Ahem! As I was saying... After his expulsion, Mr. Reus apparently went on to hold a grudge against the troupe.Nahyuta: He would tell those close to him, \"I will get my revenge on Troupe Gramarye someday!\"Judge: Revenge, hmm? That certainly sounds antagonistic.Thirteen-Year-Old Poster updated in the Court Record.Nahyuta: And then, his chance for revenge finally came. If you would be so kind, Detective Skye?Ema: ...I guess I don't have a choice, do I?Witness Testimony-- The Defendant's Motive --Ema: The victim planned to get his revenge on Troupe Gramarye during Trucy's magic show. Mr. Reus was going to first steal the Gramarye notebook from the defendant. He then intended to reveal the secrets behind their magic tricks during the show. That was the victim's plan for revenge. And while he did, in fact, steal the notebook... ...the defendant murdered him before he had a chance to reveal the secrets.Nahyuta: By the time the accused had discovered the notebook's theft, it was too late. Her only option was to kill Mr. Reus, and make it look like an accident.Apollo:Apollo: That's nothing but conjecture!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: The victim's assistant, Bonny de Famme, gave the police a statement. She testified that just before the start of the show, Mr. Reus said... \"I'm going to reveal all of Troupe Gramarye's secrets on stage today!\"Apollo: What?!Athena: Hmm... Well, that isn't exactly a great starting point for a rebuttal, is it...?Apollo: You're telling me...Nahyuta: Allow me to give you one piece of advice, defense.Apollo: Oh? And what's that?Nahyuta: Let it go, and move on.Apollo: Excuse me?Nahyuta: Helping a sinner will only sully your own soul. One possessed of an unclean soul will burn in the flames of hell... ...and then be ever burdened with that sin in their next life.Apollo: B-But I don't believe in that sort of thing... Besides, I have no intention of giving up!Nahyuta: O Holy Mother, grant me the strength to deal with this putrid lawyer. All actions have consequences, and yours will surely earn you the honor of being... ...a mere stink bug, at best, in your next life.Apollo: A stink bug?!Judge: Now then, Mr. Stink Bu-- I mean, Mr. Justice. Your cross-examination, please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Defendant's Motive --Ema: The victim planned to get his revenge on Troupe Gramarye during Trucy's magic show.Press Apollo: Apollo: Revenge after all this time? It's been thirteen years already. Why now? Ema: ...I know, right? I thought that was pretty sketchy, myself. I mean, wouldn't he have done it a long time ago, if he was gonna do it? After all-- Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Detective Skye, self-indulgent outbursts such as those will earn you divine punishment. In the form of a salary evaluation. Ema: Eep! .........MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH! Apollo: (Wait, THAT'S what \"divine punishment\" means?) Nahyuta: Let the detective have her snack. This humble servant of the Holy Mother shall explain. Over a decade ago, Troupe Gramarye was at the height of their popularity. But then their reputation declined, and they had all but faded from public memory. Until recently, that is, when Trucy Wright sought to recapture their former glory. Judge: The defendant? And at such a young age, too! How impressive! Nahyuta: ...Yes, the accused's skill at magic is undeniably impressive. If she hadn't fallen onto the path of sin, she would have had a bright future ahead of her. Judge: Hmm... It's always sad to see such promising young potential go to waste... Now, then, Detective Skye. How did Mr. Reus plan to get his revenge? And please put down the Snackoos before you continue with your testimony. Ema: MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. ...Yes, Your Honor.Ema: Mr. Reus was going to first steal the Gramarye notebook from the defendant.Press Apollo: Apollo: What evidence do you have that Mr. Reus actually stole the notebook? Ema: ...Well, you see... I... ...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH! Apollo: Um, whenever you're ready, Detective... Nahyuta: Fret not, Detective Skye. You have nothing to repent for. You should be proud of the fine forensic discovery that you made. Apollo: \"Forensic discovery\"? And what did she discover, specifically? Nahyuta: Detective Skye identified a certain set of fingerprints on the notebook. Upon further inspection, she determined that they belonged to Mr. Reus. Apollo: What?! Nahyuta: The detective found the fingerprints entirely of her own volition. For that, I must say well done, Detective Skye. Ema: Urk! ...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Apollo: (Get a little too addicted to using your precious white powder, did you, Ema?) Nahyuta: Now, Detective Skye, I would ask you to explain... ...exactly how Mr. Reus intended to use the notebook to exact his revenge. Ema: All right... Well, first, he stole the notebook...Ema: He then intended to reveal the secrets behind their magic tricks during the show.Press Apollo: Apollo: \"I'm going to reveal all of Troupe Gramarye's secrets on stage today!\" That's what Mr. Reus himself said, right? Ema: Right, but he didn't exactly specify which \"Gramarye secrets\" he was talking about. Apollo: But the prosecution thinks he was referring to the secrets behind Troupe Gramarye's magic? Nahyuta: Yes, that is the prosecution's assertion. When the accused realized that Mr. Reus was to reveal... ...her family's most closely-guarded secrets, she naturally panicked. Apollo: (So basically... ...Trucy's notebook was hiding in Mr. Reus's things because he had stolen it himself?) Judge: I see... Truly, a motive that only a magician could have. Ema: ...Yes. That's what the prosecution believes, anyway...Ema: That was the victim's plan for revenge. And while he did, in fact, steal the notebook...Press Apollo: Apollo: Do you really believe what you're saying, Detective Skye? Do you really think Ms. Wright killed Mr. Reus to stop him from getting his revenge? Ema: O-Of course I don't think that! The Trucy we know would neve--! Nahyuta: Nahyuta: ............Keep your private considerations separate from your public duty. I warned you about this very thing before the trial began, did I not, Detective Skye? Ema: ! ...Y-Yes, you did. Nahyuta: Please recite my exact words to you. Ema: \"Ema Skye, you are a detective first and foremost, not the accused's friend.\" \"Remember your duty and fulfill it faithfully.\" Nahyuta: Excellent. So you DO remember what I said to you. Your devotion to your work will be rewarded, for the Holy Mother sees all. Ema: MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH... This \"Holy Mother\" is no scientific concept I've ever heard of. Athena: Those two REALLY don't get along, do they? Apollo: Well, science and religion go together about as well as oil and water... Ema: Um, as I was saying...Ema: ...the defendant murdered him before he had a chance to reveal the secrets.Press Apollo: Apollo: I'm sorry, but what exactly is the basis for claiming it was murder? Ema: ............Beats me. Apollo: What...? The basis is \"beats me\"...? Ema: You'll have to ask Prosecutor Sahdmadhi over there, because... ...he hasn't told ME his reasoning, either. ...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Nahyuta: ...Detective Skye. Your feeding of information to the defense has not gone unnoticed by my eyes. Ema: Ulp! Nahyuta: The bad karma of acts which go against your duty will impinge upon you in your next life. But, even before that, it may impinge upon your job in the form of a transfer... Ema: Ack! P-Please don't get me kicked out of the forensics unit! Anything but that! Apollo: (Poor Ema... She's really been risking everything for us.) Well, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? What are your grounds for claiming homicide? Nahyuta: It was the luminous tape in the understage passage. I realized that it had been moved. Moved so that Mr. Reus would climb up into the downstage coffin by mistake. Apollo: What?! Nahyuta: Mr. Reus, who was waiting in the understage passage... ...was supposed to have used the upstage ladder, shown here on the left. He was to climb up into the coffin that had been set up in the backstage area. After being turned into a stuffed dragon during Act One... ...Mr. Reus was supposed to come back to life and emerge from that coffin. But the luminous tape had been moved to mark the downstage ladder... ...so the victim climbed up into the coffin on the stage itself by mistake. The very same coffin the accused thrust her sword into. Apollo: A-And you have proof that it was my client who moved the tape?! Nahyuta: But of course. ...Detective Skye? Ema: Hm? ............Oh, that's right! ...I identified the defendant's fingerprints on the luminous tape. Apollo: Y-You WHAAAT?! (He actually had proof?!) Nahyuta: Well, defense? Are you finally ready to let it all go, and move on? Apollo: A-Absolutely not! Judge: Detective, please add the information about the prints on the tape to your testimony. Adds statement \"The defendant's prints were on the tape. I guess she must've moved it during the show.\"Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: I'm sorry, but what exactly is the basis for claiming it was murder? Ema: ............Beats me. Apollo: What...? The basis is \"beats me\"...? Ema: You'll have to ask Prosecutor Sahdmadhi over there, because... ...he hasn't told ME his reasoning, either. ...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Nahyuta: ...Detective Skye. Your feeding of information to the defense has not gone unnoticed by my eyes. Ema: Ulp!

I guess she must've moved it during the show.Press Apollo: Apollo: What made you think to check the luminous tape for prints? Ema: ...W-Well... Athena: I bet it was \"detective's intuition\"! Ema: ...I dusted not just the tape, but just about everywhere for fingerprints. Apollo: Oh? Ema: I dusted pretty much every single surface in the theater. I mean, it was so nice to be able to dust for prints without anybody getting mad at me! Apollo: (It's great that you're enthusiastic, Ema, but there IS such a thing as too enthusiastic...)Present Fingerprinting Results Apollo: Leads to:  \"I'm sorry, Detective Skye, but there's a flaw in your testimony.\"Before adding statement Apollo: Let's try to draw out all that we can from Ema's testimony. Knowing her, I'm sure she'll try to help us out as much as she can. Athena: Right. As long as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi doesn't cut her off at the pass, that is...After adding statement Athena: The tape was moved... ...to guide Mr. Reus into the coffin that was downstage...? If that's true, it DOES sound like a murder rather than an accident. Apollo: It certainly doesn't help that Trucy's prints are on the tape. Athena: Ugh...

The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies given by Ema. The key ones are Testimony 3: \"That was the victim's plan for revenge. And while he did, in fact, steal the notebook...\" and Testimony 5: \"The defendant's prints were on the tape. I guess she must've moved it during the show.\"\n\nNow, looking at the evidence list, Evidence 3 is the Fingerprinting Results. It states that there are fingerprints from the victim, Bonny, and Betty de Famme on the top, but no fingerprints from Trucy. However, in Testimony 5, Ema says that Trucy's prints were on the luminous tape. But according to Evidence 3, Trucy's fingerprints aren't present. That's a contradiction. So Evidence 3 (Fingerprinting Results) contradicts Testimony 5 (about Trucy's prints on the tape). Wait, but Testimony 5 is about the tape having Trucy's prints, but the evidence says her prints aren't found. Therefore, presenting Evidence 3 against Testimony 5 would show the contradiction. But let me double-check the evidence numbers. Testimony 5 is index 5, and Evidence 3 is the Fingerprinting Results. Yes, that's correct. So the correct pair is Evidence 3 and Testimony 5. But wait, the question says to find which evidence and testimony contradict. So if Ema's Testimony 5 claims Trucy's prints were on the tape, but Evidence 3 says there's no fingerprint evidence for Trucy, that's the contradiction. Therefore, the answer would be {\"evidence\": 3, \"testimony\": 5}."

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let's start by going through the testimonies and the evidences.\n\nFirst, the testimonies. Testimony 3 is from Bonny: \"I-It was in the script... and I really wanted to see it... but I couldn't because of the accident.\" She's talking about the fire trick being canceled because of the incident. Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 7 is the Show Script, which mentions that the fire trick was canceled and specifically says, \"This will be dangerous. Make sure the fire bucket is ready!\" But the Fire Bucket (Evidence 4) is described as empty with dust inside, implying it wasn't prepared. \n\nWait, Bonny's testimony says that the fire trick was in the script and she wanted to see it but couldn't due to the accident. But the script (Evidence 7) actually says the fire trick was canceled because of the incident. However, the contradiction might be elsewhere. Wait, Betty's testimonies (Testimony 0 and 2) say she was preparing for the upcoming trick (the fire trick) and that it's dangerous so they had to be prepared. But the Fire Bucket (Evidence 4) is empty and dusty, which contradicts their preparation. So if Betty was preparing for the fire trick, the fire bucket should have been ready, not empty. \n\nBut Testimony 4 is Betty saying \"Shut up! You're gonna give it away! ...Anyway, I was real busy.\" And Testimony 5 is Bonny agreeing they were too busy. But the evidence that shows they weren't actually preparing could be the empty fire bucket. So if the script (Evidence 7) says to make sure the fire bucket is ready, but Evidence 4 shows it's empty, that contradicts Betty's claim of preparing for the fire trick. Therefore, Betty's Testimony 2 (\"That's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it.\") would be contradicted by the Fire Bucket (Evidence 4) being empty. \n\nBut wait, Testimony 3 from Bonny mentions the script and the accident. The script (Evidence 7) says the fire trick was canceled due to the incident. But Bonny says she wanted to see it but couldn't because of the accident. So maybe the contradiction is between Bonny's Testimony 3 and the Fire Bucket's state. If the script required the fire bucket to be ready, but it was empty, that means they didn't prepare properly, which might contradict the idea that they were preparing for the trick. However, since the trick was canceled, maybe they didn't need to prepare. Hmm. \n\nWait, the Show Script (Evidence 7) says the fire trick was canceled due to the incident. But Bonny's Testimony 3 says she couldn't see it because of the accident. That's consistent. Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check other possibilities. \n\nLooking at Testimony 5: Bonny says \"Way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus...\" But the Fingerprinting Results (Evidence 3) have Betty's prints on the coffin, which might suggest she had time to be there. But the testimony is about being too busy. However, the user wants a direct contradiction between a testimony and an evidence. \n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2 from Betty: \"That's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it.\" But if the fire bucket was empty (Evidence 4), they weren't prepared. Therefore, Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 2. So that would be Evidence 4 (Fire Bucket) contradicting Testimony 2 (Betty's claim of being prepared). \n\nBut the user asked for one pair. Let me check again. The Fire Bucket is empty, which contradicts the preparation for the dangerous trick. So Betty's testimony about preparing is contradicted by the empty fire bucket. Therefore, Evidence 4 and Testimony 2. \n\nBut wait, the user might be looking for another pair. Let's see another angle. The Show Script (Evidence 7) mentions the fire bucket should be ready, but the Fire Bucket (Evidence 4) is empty. So the script's instruction is not followed, which would support that they didn't prepare, contradicting Betty's Testimony 2. \n\nSo the pair would be Evidence 4 (Fire Bucket) and Testimony 2 (Betty's testimony about preparing). But the answer requires the testimony number. Testimony 2 is Betty's: \"That's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it.\" So the evidence is 4 and testimony is 2. But the user wants only one pair. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another contradiction. Let's check the testimonies again. Testimony 5: Bonny says \"Way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus...\" But Betty's fingerprints are on the coffin (Evidence 3), implying she had access, so maybe she had time. But the testimony is about being too busy. However, the fingerprints don't directly contradict being busy; maybe she touched it during preparation. \n\nAnother angle: Bonny's Testimony 3 mentions the script, but the Show Script (Evidence 7) says the fire trick was canceled. Wait, Bonny says \"it was in the script... but I couldn't because of the accident.\" The script's note says the fire trick was canceled due to the incident, which is the accident. So that's consistent. \n\nWait, the Show Script (Evidence 7) says the fire trick was canceled. So if Bonny is saying the fire trick was in the script, that's true, but it was canceled. So no contradiction there. \n\nAlternatively, the Fire Bucket (Evidence 4) is empty, but the script (Evidence 7) says to make sure it's ready. That's a contradiction in preparation. Therefore, Betty's Testimony 2, where she says she prepared because it's dangerous, is contradicted by the empty fire bucket (Evidence 4). That makes sense. So the correct pair is Evidence 4 and Testimony 2."

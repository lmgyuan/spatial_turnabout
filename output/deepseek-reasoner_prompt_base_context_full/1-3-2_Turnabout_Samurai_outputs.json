You have disgraced me for the last time, Steel Samurai! The pale moon in the sky cries for your blood! The moon? No, it is you who should gaze upon the moon... For it will be the last moon you ever see! See you in hell, Evil Magistrate! Whoooooooaaaaaaa! Grrrrrraaaaaaaah! The warriors' swords gleam and strike in the moonlight! One has fallen... but who? Only the moon knows! Don't miss next week's exciting episode: \"The Dark Messenger Returns!\" October 14, 5:31 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: That rocked! \"See you in Hell, Evil Magistrate!!!\" Phoenix: Whoa! Stop waving that broom around! Maya: Oh, Nick! I didn't know you were here! Phoenix: Of course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching? Maya: What!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people! Phoenix: Young...? Like, how young? Maya: Umm... 10 years old? Phoenix: Then what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!? Maya: Hey! I'm only 17! That's seven-\"teen.\" See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick. Phoenix: Hey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself. Maya: Then watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, \"Steel Samurai\" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release) Phoenix: I really worry about kids these days. Maya: Gramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office. Phoenix: I guess... Wish we had some clients! Phoenix: A month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month? Maya: It'll be okay. I'm sure some big client is just around the corner! Phoenix: Hmph. October 16, 8:14 AMPhoenix Wright's Bedroom Cellular: Brrrrring... Brrrrring... *beep* Phoenix: H-hello? This is Phoenix. Maya: N-N-Nick!!! Phoenix: Maya? What? It's still early... Maya: I-it's the Steel Samurai! The Steel Samurai got arrested! Phoenix: Huh? You mean the guy on that show? Maya: Yes! They're saying that the Steel Samurai killed a villain! Phoenix: ... Umm... Isn't that what he's supposed to do? Maya: Yeah, on TV! Phoenix: Yeah, on TV. Maya: No! I mean, he actually did it! In real life! He skewered a villain with his Samurai Spear! Phoenix: I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Maya: Just come to the office, quick! Please, Nick! Cellular: *beep* October 16, 9:22 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: (Maya's here... watching television.) TV: Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the \"Evil Magistrate.\" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The \"Samurai Spear\" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further. Phoenix: ... This has to be a joke. Maya: No, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over! Cellular: Brrrrring... Brrrrring... *beep* Maya: Yes... Wright & Co. Law Offices. ... What!? Nick! I-it's the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: W-what!? Maya: Yes... yes, of course! We'll be right there! Cellular: *beep* Maya: Let's go, Nick! Phoenix: Go? Go where? Maya: They have the Steel Samurai down in detention! Phoenix: So what!? Maya: So, I've decided this will be our first case! Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now. Houseplant Phoenix: Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique. Movie poster Phoenix: A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie. Desk Phoenix: Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional. Window Phoenix: It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room. Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: (Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.) Any ideas Maya: We don't have enough information to make a case yet. Phoenix: Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened. Maya: No! We just don't have enough information! Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: What about this? Maya: You like showing that off, don't you, Nick? Phoenix: (My poor, poor ego...) Anything else Phoenix: What about this? Maya: Sorry, but I don't see how that will help us figure this out... October 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: ... Phoenix: What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh! Maya: Umm... Is that guy really him? Phoenix: Whaddya mean \"that guy\"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him. Maya: Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice. Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!? Will: Umm... Maya: Y-yes!? Will: Something wrong...? Maya: N-no! No! Phoenix: (This is getting off to a great start.) Will: I know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you? Maya: D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no. Will: No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams. Maya: Oh... Will: I guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah! Maya: Nick! Phoenix: What? Maya: He's a good guy! I mean, he's good! Phoenix: Yeah. Maya: He didn't do it! Phoenix: ... Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers. Talk What happened Phoenix: Maybe you could start by telling us what happened. Will: Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear. Phoenix: The \"Samurai Spear\"...? Will: Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon. The Steel Samurai Phoenix: Maybe you could explain to me just what \"the Steel Samurai\" is. Maya: Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world. Phoenix: Hey! Who's \"new to this\"!? Will: No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah! Phoenix: I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?) Powers's alibi (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Now, where were you on the day of the murder? Will: Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here. Phoenix: (So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!) Will: What will the kids think? *sniff* Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Um, here. Will: I... I see. ... Phoenix: (Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.) Anything else Will: I-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem. After clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option: Phoenix: I think I should probably check out the scene of the murder... Will: Right... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map. Maya: Wow! Nick! Let's go! Phoenix: (I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.) Wright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: Sitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there! Phoenix: (Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.) October 16Global StudiosMain Gate Maya: Wow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!? Oldbag: Hey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me! Maya: O-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers. Oldbag: Oh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT. Maya: G-gawkers? Oldbag: Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in... Maya: Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\" Phoenix: I dunno! It's possible. Oldbag: Hey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today! Examine Computer Phoenix: The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Oldbag: Hey! No touching! Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras. Main gate Phoenix: The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate. Studio map Phoenix: An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios. Studio van Phoenix: Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment. Talk The studios Phoenix: So, what do you do here at the studios? Oldbag: At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days... Maya: No! You were a star!? Oldbag: Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie. Maya: Wo... wow. Oldbag: This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was... Phoenix: Hammer...? Oldbag: The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with... Will Powers Phoenix: Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers? Oldbag: He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his \"big chance.\" No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer... Maya: We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty! Oldbag: Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job. Mr. Hammer (appears after \"The studios\") Phoenix: What kind of person was Jack Hammer? Oldbag: What \"kind of person\"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series! Phoenix: (Should I have heard of that...?) Oldbag: But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry. Reason for suspicion (appears after \"Will Powers\") Phoenix: Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer? Oldbag: I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place! Phoenix: And... that person was Mr. Powers? Oldbag: Yes. I saw him! Phoenix: But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room. Oldbag: Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it. Present Anything Oldbag: What's that? You giving that to me? Phoenix: (Absolutely not!) After clearing all Talk options: Oldbag: Isn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along. Phoenix: Um, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request. Oldbag: Hmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in. Maya: This lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously. Detention Center Will: Hello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they? Maya: N-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick? Phoenix: Right, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect. Will: *sniff* Talk Your alibi Phoenix: Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you? Will: W-what? No! I'd never do that! Phoenix: Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch. Will: Yes. Like a baby. Phoenix: But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime! Will: W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise! Phoenix: Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get. Will: I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me? Phoenix: (What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.) The security lady Phoenix: Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio... Will: Oh, the security lady? Maya: She's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"! Will: Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you. Maya: Grr! She's got some nerve! Phoenix: Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation? Will: Of c-course. Powers's Request added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I just hope this will get me past that security lady.) The security lady (subsequent times) Phoenix: Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio... Will: Oh, the security lady? Maya: She's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"! Will: Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you. Maya: Grr! She's got some nerve! Present Powers's Letter Phoenix: Thank you for the letter of request. Will: Show that to the security lady and she should let you in. Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Powers's Letter Phoenix: Hey, look what I have! Maya: Hey! The Steel Samurai said we'd need that to get into the studio. Phoenix: You mean Will Powers said we'd need it...? Maya: Yes, the Steel Samurai. Phoenix: *sigh* Studio - Main Gate Present Powers's Letter Leads to: \"Ma'am, have a look at this.\" Phoenix: Ma'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers. Oldbag: Hmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl. Gave Powers's Request to the security lady. Oldbag: To think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Anyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. \"No one allowed inside, pal\" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself. Maya: Hey, hey, Nick. Phoenix: Huh? Maya: There were maps in the security guard station. Phoenix: Hey! Not bad! Oldbag: Those are 50 cents a piece, thank you! Maya: Well, time to go, Nick. Oldbag: 50 cents! Guidemap of Global Studios added to the Court Record. October 16Studio One Entrance Gumshoe: Hey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day! Maya: Aah! It's that confused detective! Gumshoe: Hey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window! Phoenix: Umm... so? Maya: Hey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work! Gumshoe: !!! ... ... ... Maya: Um, Detective? Phoenix: I think you hurt his feelings. Maya: Oh no! I... I'm sorry! Phoenix: Well, I think his feelings are easily hurt. Gumshoe: You're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart! Maya: Hey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case! Gumshoe: Yeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here? Maya: Um, well... We're on this case too, pal! Gumshoe: Huh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait! Maya: I'd say he's a character alright... Examine Bench Phoenix: I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here. Gumshoe: Hey, good idea, pal! Maya: Detective! Aren't you on the case? Gumshoe: W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal! Left path Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though. Statue with broken head Phoenix: The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two] Maya: What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted. Gumshoe: Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too. Security camera Phoenix: Hey, there's a camera here. Gumshoe: That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where! Phoenix: There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number. Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. Maya: Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked! Phoenix: Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out. Welcome sign Maya: There's a big welcome sign above the path. Gumshoe: Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission. Maya: Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here? Phoenix: Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all. Gumshoe: Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!? Talk The investigation Phoenix: So, how is your investigation going, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal. Maya: Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions? Phoenix: Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got? Gumshoe: What I got? Phoenix: The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please... Gumshoe: Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. The investigation (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, how is your investigation going, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court! Phoenix: (Oh well, it was worth a try.) Reason for arrest Phoenix: Why was Mr. Powers arrested? Gumshoe: Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate. Maya: Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence! Phoenix: Thanks for cheering me up... The security lady Phoenix: About the security lady... Gumshoe: Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer! Phoenix: Huh? A-are we talking about the same person? Gumshoe: When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee! Maya: Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority. Gumshoe: She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence! Maya: Whaat!? Decisive evidence (appears after \"The security lady\") Phoenix: What kind of evidence!? Gumshoe: Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime! Maya: What! Who took that!? Gumshoe: See the camera up on that gate, pal? Maya: The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign? Gumshoe: Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them! Maya: Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished! Phoenix: (Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.) Gumshoe: ... Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that! Phoenix: I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired... Maya: Maybe it should just be a big \"L\" for \"Lawyer\"? Phoenix: Hmm... I'm not so sure about that. Anything else Phoenix: Um, Detective. Any ideas about this? Gumshoe: Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal? After clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options: Gumshoe: What's wrong, pal? You seem down. Phoenix: Don't look so happy when you say that. Gumshoe: Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh! Maya: Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions... Gumshoe: Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah! Phoenix: (I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.) Maya: Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out! Studio - Main Gate Maya: Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts! Phoenix: Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them... Oldbag: Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet? Phoenix: (Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...) Talk Photographic proof Phoenix: Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am? Oldbag: Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see. Reason for suspicion Oldbag: This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is! Phoenix: Maybe... it was you? Oldbag: Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny. Phoenix: (She thinks I was joking.) Mr. Hammer Phoenix: Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor? Oldbag: Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio! Phoenix: (\"Was\"? Past tense?) Maya: Oh yes! He was great as the \"Bearded Samurai\"! Oldbag: That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the \"Evil Magistrate\"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him? Automatic camera (appears after \"Photographic proof\") Phoenix: About the security camera... Oldbag: Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do. October 16Wright & Co. Law Offices Maya: What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!? Phoenix: Don't look at me! How should I know? Talk What to do Phoenix: What do you think? Maya: That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here. Phoenix: Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot. Photographic proof Phoenix: Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it. Maya: I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick? Phoenix: Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone? Maya: On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio. October 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: ... Maya: Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning. Phoenix: Hmm... right. Gumshoe: Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers! Phoenix: I have to ask him about that photograph! Maya: Oh well. Let's try again later. Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera. October 16Global StudiosEmployee Area Maya: Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around! Examine Bicycle Phoenix: Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point? Maya: It makes it a lot easier to go up hills! Phoenix: Don't people cycle to get exercise!? Drain grate Phoenix: The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet. Maya: Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate! Phoenix: Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest. Maya: Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid! Grate Phoenix: The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on. Lunch table Phoenix: The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak. Maya: Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot. Phoenix: You just had a burger! Maya: Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks. Phoenix: (What!?) Stage backdrop Phoenix: There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably \"Neo Olde Tokyo Castle.\" Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Maya: Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...? Phoenix: What do you mean \"find\"!? Maya: You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear! Phoenix: We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!) Dressing room sign Phoenix: There's a sign on the dressing room door. \"Mr. Will Powers\"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this. Dressing room window Phoenix: A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside. Storage room door Phoenix: That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment. Maya: Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry! Phoenix: Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio? Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least! Maya: W-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this! Phoenix: (Ladies first...) October 16Global StudiosDressing Room Phoenix: (Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.) Maya: No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they? Phoenix: Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!) Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's a vast array of cosmetics here. Maya: Ooh! This is the wig he used in \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"! Nick! Try this on! Phoenix: No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!? Maya: I, um, kinda like samurai movies. Phoenix: (\"Kinda\"...?) Costume rack Phoenix: There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes. Maya: It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes... Phoenix: (I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.) Couch Phoenix: Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday... Mirror Phoenix: They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it. Bag Maya: Hmm? This must be Powers's bag. Phoenix: Hey, don't open that. Maya: Look! Phoenix: An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says \"Studio One.\" Maya: Let's take it, Nick! Phoenix: Borrow it. You mean borrow. Cardkey added to the Court Record. Bag (subsequent times) Maya: I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...? Phoenix: Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.) Table Phoenix: There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies... Maya: Nick... I'm hungry! Phoenix: You just had a burger! Maya: Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets! Phoenix: (How many stomachs does this girl have!?) Window Phoenix: It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside. Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Cardkey Maya: Oh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out! Studio - Main Gate Present Cardkey Phoenix: Could you tell me about this, ma'am? Oldbag: Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over! Phoenix: W-wait! No, that's mine! Oldbag: Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died. Phoenix: W... well you'll just have to wait! Outside Studio One Examine Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. Maya: Let's go in and check it out, Nick! Phoenix: I wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work... *beep* Phoenix: It opened! Maya: Alright! We're in! Phoenix: (She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.) Present Cardkey Maya: Hey, Detective! Take a look at this! Gumshoe: Whazzat? Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it! Maya: Aww... I just wanted to show it off. After examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance: October 16Studio One Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: ... Phoenix: You're real quiet all of a sudden. Maya: Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real! Phoenix: Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me... Examine Director's chair Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone! Phoenix: ... Maya: Ready, Nick? Action! Phoenix: (This girl is more troubled than I thought...) Film camera Leads to: \"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\" Reflecting screen Maya: What's this? Phoenix: That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming. Maya: Huh. Phoenix: What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment? Maya: Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: (I think she's being serious...!) Stage backdrop Phoenix: Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show. Maya: Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama! Phoenix: Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there? Maya: Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo! Phoenix: Oh. Right. (Step)ladder Maya: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Maya: So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick! Phoenix: R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!) Tape outline Phoenix: They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it... Maya: Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton! Phoenix: Yeah! So don't touch it! Maya: Whoa! It's heavier than I thought... ???: Hey! You! No touching that! Phoenix: Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know... Maya: \"Y'know\"!? No I don't know! Phoenix: Umm... who are you? Penny: Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera. Maya: We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers. Penny: Oh, you're WP's people. Maya: \"WP\"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it. Penny: I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent. Maya: Don't worry, leave it to us! Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder? Penny: Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see. Maya: Only one assistant!? Penny: Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences. Maya: Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release) Penny: In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else. Phoenix: The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right? Penny: Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that. Will Powers Phoenix: Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room? Penny: No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!? Phoenix: W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, any thoughts about this? Penny: Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph... Phoenix: Hmm... Penny: Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy. Phoenix: Not really. Penny: Actually, there's been something bothering me. Maya: Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead! Penny: Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here... Phoenix: You \"sensed\"? Penny: Yes, several times. Phoenix: Some other studio employees, maybe? Penny: No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside. Phoenix: R-really!? Maya: But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them? Phoenix: Yeah, you're right. Penny: I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that. Maya: No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot! Talk Sensing someone Phoenix: So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio? Penny: Yes... I think. Phoenix: (\"I think\" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.) Maya: Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them! October 16Global StudiosMain Gate Oldbag: What? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost! Talk Assistant's claim Leads to: \"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\" Oldbag: What? I saw that suspicious look on your face! Phoenix: I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times? Oldbag: Sure as can be! Maya: But we have a witness who thinks there was \"someone from outside\" here that day. Oldbag: What!? Maya: Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time? Oldbag: ... Maya: Ma'am? Oldbag: Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!? Maya: Eek! Oldbag: Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!? Maya: Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One. Oldbag: Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr! Phoenix: She left... Maya: Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders! Examine Computer Phoenix: The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Maya: Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer! Phoenix: Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?) Try it Phoenix: Okay. Let's give it a try. Maya: You know how to work these things, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.) [Please enter the number of the security camera.] ST1-703 Phoenix: There! Entered! Maya: ... ... Nothing happened. Phoenix: Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong. Maya: *sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again? Leads back to examination ST1-307 Leads to: \"There! Entered!\" ST1-370 Phoenix: There! Entered! Maya: ... ... Nothing happened. Phoenix: Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong. Maya: *sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again? Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: (Hmm... I'd better not fool around with this, or that security lady will get me. Maybe next time.) Maya: What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring! Leads back to examination Phoenix: There! Entered! ... Maya: Hey! It printed out the data for that day! Phoenix: Let's see what we got... ... Huh? Maya: How is this a picture of Will Powers? Phoenix: Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him. Maya: I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back. Phoenix: Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] Maya: What does that mean? Phoenix: Maybe there's more photo data from that day? Maya: Nope--that's the only one in the computer. Powers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record. Maya: Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial? Phoenix: Yeah. Maya: We'll put that security lady in her place with this! Phoenix: Right, we'll put her in her place... Maya: Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says! Phoenix: Wait. Let's not. Maya: Why not? Phoenix: It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon. Maya: Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate! Phoenix: Hey! Why do I have to be the villain. Maya: Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today? Phoenix: I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...? To be continued. Before selecting \"ST1-307\" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate: October 16Studio One Maya: No one's here. I wonder if the security lady got mad at that assistant? Phoenix: Hmm. That's definitely a possibility. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\nTurnabout Samurai TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge: Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth: The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge: Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth: Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth: Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe: Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix: (Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it Leads to: \"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again Phoenix: I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time? Gumshoe: I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer. Phoenix: (Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.) Leads back to: \"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"Phoenix: (I think I can probably remember that...)Judge: So the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth: Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge: Understood.Edgeworth: Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth: Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag: ... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth: Y-your name, please!Oldbag: Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth: YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix: (Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag: Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth: O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge: Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag: I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth: Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge: Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag: Yessey I was.Judge: And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag: You know your stuff, dearie!Judge: ... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix: (She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning. I, well, I had some errands to run that morning. Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station. I was at the main gate from then until 5:00! Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right? Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM. It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge: You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio? Oldbag: Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in. Phoenix: (Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.) Edgeworth: Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag: Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A \"run-through\"...? Oldbag: They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon. Phoenix: (So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...) Edgeworth: If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag: I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of \"errands\"? Oldbag: Oh, well, you know. Phoenix: Answer the question! Oldbag: Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know? Phoenix: O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station? Oldbag: Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job! Phoenix: (I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...) Oldbag: Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years. Maya: Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too! Phoenix: You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty. Maya: Not a bad idea...Oldbag: Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you see the victim then? Oldbag: Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station. Edgeworth: Tell us what happened next.Oldbag: I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second? Oldbag: O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper! Phoenix: No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday... Oldbag: I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper! Maya: \"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick. Phoenix: Why don't you raise an objection? Judge: So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag: Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How did you know that? Oldbag: Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag: Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: 2:00? You're sure? Oldbag: Sure as spit! Judge: Well, who was the man!? Oldbag: Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something. Judge: ... Oldbag: Now, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Oldbag: It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw Mr. Powers? Oldbag: That's what I said!

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidence, and testimonies from the game, specifically the Turnabout Samurai case.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the testimonies given by Oldbag. The testimonies are about her account of the day of the murder. Let me go through each one:\n\nTestimony 0: She arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nTestimony 1: Hammer and others were doing a run-through since morning.\nTestimony 2: She had errands that morning.\nTestimony 3: She got to the guard station at 1:00.\nTestimony 4: She was at the main gate from then until 5:00.\nTestimony 5: The murder happened at 2:30 PM.\nTestimony 6: A man walked by her at 2:00 PM.\nTestimony 7: That man was Powers heading to the studio.\n\nThe key here is the photo evidence, Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo. The description says it's taken at 2:00 PM, showing the Steel Samurai (Powers) dragging one leg. But earlier, in the story transcript, when Phoenix and Maya check the security camera data, they find that the photo actually shows the Steel Samurai in costume, but Oldbag assumes it's Powers. However, the time on the photo is 2:00 PM. But wait, in the testimonies, Oldbag says in Testimony 6 that the man (Powers) walked by her at 2:00 PM. But the problem arises when considering the time of death. The autopsy report (Evidence 3) states the time of death as 2:30 PM. If Powers was seen going to the studio at 2:00 PM, how does that align with the murder happening at 2:30 PM?\n\nWait, but the contradiction might be elsewhere. Let me think again. The Security Lady (Oldbag) claims she saw Powers at 2:00 PM heading to the studio (Testimony 6 and 7). However, the photo (Evidence 5) is timestamped 2:00 PM. But if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, then Powers would have had time to commit the murder. However, there's another angle. The photo shows the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. But earlier in the story, it's mentioned that Will Powers had a broken leg, which is why he was limping. However, in the script, Phoenix realizes that the photo actually shows someone else in the costume, perhaps the real killer, because Powers was supposed to be sleeping. Wait, but in the evidence, the photo is labeled as being Powers, but in reality, it might not be him. \n\nWait, but the key contradiction here is that Oldbag's testimony (Testimony 6 and 7) claims that Powers was seen at 2:00 PM heading to the studio. However, the photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai (which is Powers' character) at 2:00 PM. However, Powers had an alibi that he was sleeping. But if the photo is of someone else in the costume, then Oldbag's testimony is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the time of the photo is different. Wait, the photo's time is 2:00 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM, so that's not directly conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the real contradiction is in the time when the security lady arrived. In Testimony 0 and 3, she says she arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. However, in the story transcript, when Phoenix checks the security camera data, the camera was activated at 1:00 PM. But the photo taken is at 2:00 PM. But the security lady claims she was there from 1:00 PM onwards, but during that time, the only person she saw was Powers at 2:00 PM. However, the photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai walking at 2:00 PM. But if Powers was in his dressing room sleeping, then the person in the photo can't be him. Therefore, the contradiction is between Oldbag's testimony that she saw Powers at 2:00 PM (Testimony 7) and the photo (Evidence 5) which actually shows the Steel Samurai (who could be someone else in the costume). Thus, the evidence (photo) contradicts her testimony that it was Powers. \n\nBut looking back at the evidence list, Evidence 5 is \"Powers'(?) Photo\" with the description stating that the photo shows the Steel Samurai, but the caption says \"Steel Samurai is seen walking. He's dragging one leg.\" However, if Powers was supposed to have a broken leg (as per the story), but in reality, the person in the photo is the real killer, then Oldbag's testimony (Testimony 7) that it was Powers is contradicted by the photo showing the limping figure, which could be someone else. Alternatively, maybe the time of the photo is the issue. Wait, the photo is timestamped 2:00 PM, but the murder was at 2:30 PM. So, the photo would show the person entering, but the actual murder happened later. But how does that create a contradiction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the real contradiction is that the security lady claims she was at her post from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM (Testimony 4), but in the story, Phoenix finds that the security camera wasn't activated until 1:00 PM when she arrived. However, the photo (Evidence 5) is taken at 2:00 PM, which aligns with her testimony. But maybe another piece of evidence contradicts her claim of being there the whole time. Wait, there's another evidence: the Empty Bottle/Sleeping Pill Bottle (Evidence 7) found in the employee area with Jack Hammer's fingerprints. If Jack was drugged, maybe he was asleep, but the testimony says he was in the studio. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, the key contradiction is in the fact that Oldbag testifies that Powers was the only one who passed by between 1:00 PM and 2:30 PM. But the photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai at 2:00 PM, but if the real killer was in the costume, then the testimony is wrong. So the contradiction is between Testimony 7 (It was Powers) and Evidence 5 (the photo which actually shows someone else). However, the evidence is presented as \"Powers'(?) Photo\", indicating uncertainty. So the photo's caption says it's Powers, but in reality, it's not. Therefore, presenting Evidence 5 (the photo) during cross-examination of Testimony 7 would show that the person in the photo is not Powers but someone else in the costume, thus contradicting Oldbag's testimony.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair is Evidence 5 (the photo) contradicting Testimony 7 (claiming it was Powers). However, looking back at the user's evidence list:\n\nEvidence 5\nName: Powers'(?) Photo\nDescription: ... [caption] Steel Samurai is seen walking. He's dragging one leg.\n\nTestimony 7\nTestimony: It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!\n\nThe photo shows the Steel Samurai, but the fact that he's dragging one leg might indicate that it's not Powers, but someone else (like the real killer who had an injury). Therefore, the testimony that it was Powers is contradicted by the photo's detail of the leg drag, implying it's someone else. Hence, the evidence is 5 and testimony is 7."

Law Offices Maya: That rocked! \"See you in Hell, Evil Magistrate!!!\" Phoenix: Whoa! Stop waving that broom around! Maya: Oh, Nick! I didn't know you were here! Phoenix: Of course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching? Maya: What!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people! Phoenix: Young...? Like, how young? Maya: Umm... 10 years old? Phoenix: Then what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!? Maya: Hey! I'm only 17! That's seven-\"teen.\" See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick. Phoenix: Hey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself. Maya: Then watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, \"Steel Samurai\" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release) Phoenix: I really worry about kids these days. Maya: Gramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office. Phoenix: I guess... Wish we had some clients! Phoenix: A month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month? Maya: It'll be okay. I'm sure some big client is just around the corner! Phoenix: Hmph. October 16, 8:14 AMPhoenix Wright's Bedroom Cellular: Brrrrring... Brrrrring... *beep* Phoenix: H-hello? This is Phoenix. Maya: N-N-Nick!!! Phoenix: Maya? What? It's still early... Maya: I-it's the Steel Samurai! The Steel Samurai got arrested! Phoenix: Huh? You mean the guy on that show? Maya: Yes! They're saying that the Steel Samurai killed a villain! Phoenix: ... Umm... Isn't that what he's supposed to do? Maya: Yeah, on TV! Phoenix: Yeah, on TV. Maya: No! I mean, he actually did it! In real life! He skewered a villain with his Samurai Spear! Phoenix: I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Maya: Just come to the office, quick! Please, Nick! Cellular: *beep* October 16, 9:22 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: (Maya's here... watching television.) TV: Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the \"Evil Magistrate.\" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The \"Samurai Spear\" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further. Phoenix: ... This has to be a joke. Maya: No, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over! Cellular: Brrrrring... Brrrrring... *beep* Maya: Yes... Wright & Co. Law Offices. ... What!? Nick! I-it's the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: W-what!? Maya: Yes... yes, of course! We'll be right there! Cellular: *beep* Maya: Let's go, Nick! Phoenix: Go? Go where? Maya: They have the Steel Samurai down in detention! Phoenix: So what!? Maya: So, I've decided this will be our first case! Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now. Houseplant Phoenix: Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique. Movie poster Phoenix: A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie. Desk Phoenix: Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional. Window Phoenix: It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room. Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: (Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.) Any ideas Maya: We don't have enough information to make a case yet. Phoenix: Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened. Maya: No! We just don't have enough information! Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: What about this? Maya: You like showing that off, don't you, Nick? Phoenix: (My poor, poor ego...) Anything else Phoenix: What about this? Maya: Sorry, but I don't see how that will help us figure this out... October 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: ... Phoenix: What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh! Maya: Umm... Is that guy really him? Phoenix: Whaddya mean \"that guy\"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him. Maya: Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice. Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!? Will: Umm... Maya: Y-yes!? Will: Something wrong...? Maya: N-no! No! Phoenix: (This is getting off to a great start.) Will: I know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you? Maya: D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no. Will: No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams. Maya: Oh... Will: I guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah! Maya: Nick! Phoenix: What? Maya: He's a good guy! I mean, he's good! Phoenix: Yeah. Maya: He didn't do it! Phoenix: ... Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers. Talk What happened Phoenix: Maybe you could start by telling us what happened. Will: Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear. Phoenix: The \"Samurai Spear\"...? Will: Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon. The Steel Samurai Phoenix: Maybe you could explain to me just what \"the Steel Samurai\" is. Maya: Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world. Phoenix: Hey! Who's \"new to this\"!? Will: No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah! Phoenix: I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?) Powers's alibi (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Now, where were you on the day of the murder? Will: Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here. Phoenix: (So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!) Will: What will the kids think? *sniff* Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Um, here. Will: I... I see. ... Phoenix: (Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.) Anything else Will: I-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem. After clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option: Phoenix: I think I should probably check out the scene of the murder... Will: Right... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map. Maya: Wow! Nick! Let's go! Phoenix: (I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.) Wright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: Sitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there! Phoenix: (Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.) October 16Global StudiosMain Gate Maya: Wow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!? Oldbag: Hey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me! Maya: O-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers. Oldbag: Oh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT. Maya: G-gawkers? Oldbag: Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in... Maya: Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\" Phoenix: I dunno! It's possible. Oldbag: Hey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today! Examine Computer Phoenix: The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Oldbag: Hey! No touching! Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras. Main gate Phoenix: The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate. Studio map Phoenix: An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios. Studio van Phoenix: Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment. Talk The studios Phoenix: So, what do you do here at the studios? Oldbag: At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days... Maya: No! You were a star!? Oldbag: Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie. Maya: Wo... wow. Oldbag: This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was... Phoenix: Hammer...? Oldbag: The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with... Will Powers Phoenix: Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers? Oldbag: He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his \"big chance.\" No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer... Maya: We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty! Oldbag: Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job. Mr. Hammer (appears after \"The studios\") Phoenix: What kind of person was Jack Hammer? Oldbag: What \"kind of person\"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series! Phoenix: (Should I have heard of that...?) Oldbag: But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry. Reason for suspicion (appears after \"Will Powers\") Phoenix: Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer? Oldbag: I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place! Phoenix: And... that person was Mr. Powers? Oldbag: Yes. I saw him! Phoenix: But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room. Oldbag: Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it. Present Anything Oldbag: What's that? You giving that to me? Phoenix: (Absolutely not!) After clearing all Talk options: Oldbag: Isn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along. Phoenix: Um, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request. Oldbag: Hmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in. Maya: This lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously. Detention Center Will: Hello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they? Maya: N-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick? Phoenix: Right, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect. Will: *sniff* Talk Your alibi Phoenix: Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you? Will: W-what? No! I'd never do that! Phoenix: Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch. Will: Yes. Like a baby. Phoenix: But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime! Will: W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise! Phoenix: Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get. Will: I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me? Phoenix: (What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.) The security lady Phoenix: Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio... Will: Oh, the security lady? Maya: She's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"! Will: Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you. Maya: Grr! She's got some nerve! Phoenix: Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation? Will: Of c-course. Powers's Request added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I just hope this will get me past that security lady.) The security lady (subsequent times) Phoenix: Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio... Will: Oh, the security lady? Maya: She's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"! Will: Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you. Maya: Grr! She's got some nerve! Present Powers's Letter Phoenix: Thank you for the letter of request. Will: Show that to the security lady and she should let you in. Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Powers's Letter Phoenix: Hey, look what I have! Maya: Hey! The Steel Samurai said we'd need that to get into the studio. Phoenix: You mean Will Powers said we'd need it...? Maya: Yes, the Steel Samurai. Phoenix: *sigh* Studio - Main Gate Present Powers's Letter Leads to: \"Ma'am, have a look at this.\" Phoenix: Ma'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers. Oldbag: Hmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl. Gave Powers's Request to the security lady. Oldbag: To think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Anyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. \"No one allowed inside, pal\" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself. Maya: Hey, hey, Nick. Phoenix: Huh? Maya: There were maps in the security guard station. Phoenix: Hey! Not bad! Oldbag: Those are 50 cents a piece, thank you! Maya: Well, time to go, Nick. Oldbag: 50 cents! Guidemap of Global Studios added to the Court Record. October 16Studio One Entrance Gumshoe: Hey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day! Maya: Aah! It's that confused detective! Gumshoe: Hey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window! Phoenix: Umm... so? Maya: Hey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work! Gumshoe: !!! ... ... ... Maya: Um, Detective? Phoenix: I think you hurt his feelings. Maya: Oh no! I... I'm sorry! Phoenix: Well, I think his feelings are easily hurt. Gumshoe: You're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart! Maya: Hey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case! Gumshoe: Yeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here? Maya: Um, well... We're on this case too, pal! Gumshoe: Huh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait! Maya: I'd say he's a character alright... Examine Bench Phoenix: I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here. Gumshoe: Hey, good idea, pal! Maya: Detective! Aren't you on the case? Gumshoe: W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal! Left path Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though. Statue with broken head Phoenix: The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two] Maya: What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted. Gumshoe: Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too. Security camera Phoenix: Hey, there's a camera here. Gumshoe: That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where! Phoenix: There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number. Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. Maya: Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked! Phoenix: Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out. Welcome sign Maya: There's a big welcome sign above the path. Gumshoe: Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission. Maya: Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here? Phoenix: Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all. Gumshoe: Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!? Talk The investigation Phoenix: So, how is your investigation going, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal. Maya: Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions? Phoenix: Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got? Gumshoe: What I got? Phoenix: The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please... Gumshoe: Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. The investigation (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, how is your investigation going, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court! Phoenix: (Oh well, it was worth a try.) Reason for arrest Phoenix: Why was Mr. Powers arrested? Gumshoe: Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate. Maya: Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence! Phoenix: Thanks for cheering me up... The security lady Phoenix: About the security lady... Gumshoe: Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer! Phoenix: Huh? A-are we talking about the same person? Gumshoe: When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee! Maya: Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority. Gumshoe: She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence! Maya: Whaat!? Decisive evidence (appears after \"The security lady\") Phoenix: What kind of evidence!? Gumshoe: Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime! Maya: What! Who took that!? Gumshoe: See the camera up on that gate, pal? Maya: The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign? Gumshoe: Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them! Maya: Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished! Phoenix: (Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.) Gumshoe: ... Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that! Phoenix: I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired... Maya: Maybe it should just be a big \"L\" for \"Lawyer\"? Phoenix: Hmm... I'm not so sure about that. Anything else Phoenix: Um, Detective. Any ideas about this? Gumshoe: Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal? After clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options: Gumshoe: What's wrong, pal? You seem down. Phoenix: Don't look so happy when you say that. Gumshoe: Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh! Maya: Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions... Gumshoe: Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah! Phoenix: (I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.) Maya: Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out! Studio - Main Gate Maya: Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts! Phoenix: Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them... Oldbag: Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet? Phoenix: (Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...) Talk Photographic proof Phoenix: Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am? Oldbag: Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see. Reason for suspicion Oldbag: This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is! Phoenix: Maybe... it was you? Oldbag: Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny. Phoenix: (She thinks I was joking.) Mr. Hammer Phoenix: Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor? Oldbag: Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio! Phoenix: (\"Was\"? Past tense?) Maya: Oh yes! He was great as the \"Bearded Samurai\"! Oldbag: That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the \"Evil Magistrate\"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him? Automatic camera (appears after \"Photographic proof\") Phoenix: About the security camera... Oldbag: Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do. October 16Wright & Co. Law Offices Maya: What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!? Phoenix: Don't look at me! How should I know? Talk What to do Phoenix: What do you think? Maya: That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here. Phoenix: Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot. Photographic proof Phoenix: Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it. Maya: I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick? Phoenix: Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone? Maya: On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio. October 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: ... Maya: Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning. Phoenix: Hmm... right. Gumshoe: Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers! Phoenix: I have to ask him about that photograph! Maya: Oh well. Let's try again later. Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera. October 16Global StudiosEmployee Area Maya: Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around! Examine Bicycle Phoenix: Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point? Maya: It makes it a lot easier to go up hills! Phoenix: Don't people cycle to get exercise!? Drain grate Phoenix: The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet. Maya: Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate! Phoenix: Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest. Maya: Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid! Grate Phoenix: The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on. Lunch table Phoenix: The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak. Maya: Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot. Phoenix: You just had a burger! Maya: Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks. Phoenix: (What!?) Stage backdrop Phoenix: There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably \"Neo Olde Tokyo Castle.\" Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Maya: Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...? Phoenix: What do you mean \"find\"!? Maya: You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear! Phoenix: We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!) Dressing room sign Phoenix: There's a sign on the dressing room door. \"Mr. Will Powers\"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this. Dressing room window Phoenix: A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside. Storage room door Phoenix: That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment. Maya: Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry! Phoenix: Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio? Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least! Maya: W-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this! Phoenix: (Ladies first...) October 16Global StudiosDressing Room Phoenix: (Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.) Maya: No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they? Phoenix: Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!) Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's a vast array of cosmetics here. Maya: Ooh! This is the wig he used in \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"! Nick! Try this on! Phoenix: No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!? Maya: I, um, kinda like samurai movies. Phoenix: (\"Kinda\"...?) Costume rack Phoenix: There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes. Maya: It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes... Phoenix: (I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.) Couch Phoenix: Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday... Mirror Phoenix: They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it. Bag Maya: Hmm? This must be Powers's bag. Phoenix: Hey, don't open that. Maya: Look! Phoenix: An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says \"Studio One.\" Maya: Let's take it, Nick! Phoenix: Borrow it. You mean borrow. Cardkey added to the Court Record. Bag (subsequent times) Maya: I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...? Phoenix: Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.) Table Phoenix: There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies... Maya: Nick... I'm hungry! Phoenix: You just had a burger! Maya: Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets! Phoenix: (How many stomachs does this girl have!?) Window Phoenix: It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside. Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Cardkey Maya: Oh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out! Studio - Main Gate Present Cardkey Phoenix: Could you tell me about this, ma'am? Oldbag: Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over! Phoenix: W-wait! No, that's mine! Oldbag: Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died. Phoenix: W... well you'll just have to wait! Outside Studio One Examine Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. Maya: Let's go in and check it out, Nick! Phoenix: I wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work... *beep* Phoenix: It opened! Maya: Alright! We're in! Phoenix: (She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.) Present Cardkey Maya: Hey, Detective! Take a look at this! Gumshoe: Whazzat? Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it! Maya: Aww... I just wanted to show it off. After examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance: October 16Studio One Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: ... Phoenix: You're real quiet all of a sudden. Maya: Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real! Phoenix: Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me... Examine Director's chair Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone! Phoenix: ... Maya: Ready, Nick? Action! Phoenix: (This girl is more troubled than I thought...) Film camera Leads to: \"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\" Reflecting screen Maya: What's this? Phoenix: That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming. Maya: Huh. Phoenix: What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment? Maya: Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: (I think she's being serious...!) Stage backdrop Phoenix: Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show. Maya: Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama! Phoenix: Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there? Maya: Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo! Phoenix: Oh. Right. (Step)ladder Maya: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Maya: So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick! Phoenix: R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!) Tape outline Phoenix: They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it... Maya: Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton! Phoenix: Yeah! So don't touch it! Maya: Whoa! It's heavier than I thought... ???: Hey! You! No touching that! Phoenix: Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know... Maya: \"Y'know\"!? No I don't know! Phoenix: Umm... who are you? Penny: Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera. Maya: We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers. Penny: Oh, you're WP's people. Maya: \"WP\"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it. Penny: I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent. Maya: Don't worry, leave it to us! Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder? Penny: Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see. Maya: Only one assistant!? Penny: Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences. Maya: Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release) Penny: In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else. Phoenix: The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right? Penny: Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that. Will Powers Phoenix: Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room? Penny: No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!? Phoenix: W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, any thoughts about this? Penny: Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph... Phoenix: Hmm... Penny: Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy. Phoenix: Not really. Penny: Actually, there's been something bothering me. Maya: Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead! Penny: Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here... Phoenix: You \"sensed\"? Penny: Yes, several times. Phoenix: Some other studio employees, maybe? Penny: No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside. Phoenix: R-really!? Maya: But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them? Phoenix: Yeah, you're right. Penny: I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that. Maya: No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot! Talk Sensing someone Phoenix: So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio? Penny: Yes... I think. Phoenix: (\"I think\" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.) Maya: Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them! October 16Global StudiosMain Gate Oldbag: What? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost! Talk Assistant's claim Leads to: \"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\" Oldbag: What? I saw that suspicious look on your face! Phoenix: I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times? Oldbag: Sure as can be! Maya: But we have a witness who thinks there was \"someone from outside\" here that day. Oldbag: What!? Maya: Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time? Oldbag: ... Maya: Ma'am? Oldbag: Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!? Maya: Eek! Oldbag: Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!? Maya: Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One. Oldbag: Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr! Phoenix: She left... Maya: Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders! Examine Computer Phoenix: The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Maya: Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer! Phoenix: Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?) Try it Phoenix: Okay. Let's give it a try. Maya: You know how to work these things, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.) [Please enter the number of the security camera.] ST1-703 Phoenix: There! Entered! Maya: ... ... Nothing happened. Phoenix: Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong. Maya: *sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again? Leads back to examination ST1-307 Leads to: \"There! Entered!\" ST1-370 Phoenix: There! Entered! Maya: ... ... Nothing happened. Phoenix: Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong. Maya: *sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again? Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: (Hmm... I'd better not fool around with this, or that security lady will get me. Maybe next time.) Maya: What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring! Leads back to examination Phoenix: There! Entered! ... Maya: Hey! It printed out the data for that day! Phoenix: Let's see what we got... ... Huh? Maya: How is this a picture of Will Powers? Phoenix: Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him. Maya: I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back. Phoenix: Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] Maya: What does that mean? Phoenix: Maybe there's more photo data from that day? Maya: Nope--that's the only one in the computer. Powers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record. Maya: Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial? Phoenix: Yeah. Maya: We'll put that security lady in her place with this! Phoenix: Right, we'll put her in her place... Maya: Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says! Phoenix: Wait. Let's not. Maya: Why not? Phoenix: It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon. Maya: Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate! Phoenix: Hey! Why do I have to be the villain. Maya: Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today? Phoenix: I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...? To be continued. Before selecting \"ST1-307\" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate: October 16Studio One Maya: No one's here. I wonder if the security lady got mad at that assistant? Phoenix: Hmm. That's definitely a possibility. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\nTurnabout Samurai TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge: Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth: The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge: Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth: Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth: Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe: Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix: (Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it Leads to: \"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again Phoenix: I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time? Gumshoe: I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer. Phoenix: (Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.) Leads back to: \"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"Phoenix: (I think I can probably remember that...)Judge: So the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth: Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge: Understood.Edgeworth: Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth: Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag: ... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth: Y-your name, please!Oldbag: Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth: YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix: (Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag: Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth: O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge: Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag: I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth: Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge: Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag: Yessey I was.Judge: And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag: You know your stuff, dearie!Judge: ... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix: (She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning. I, well, I had some errands to run that morning. Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station. I was at the main gate from then until 5:00! Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right? Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM. It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge: You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio? Oldbag: Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in. Phoenix: (Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.) Edgeworth: Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag: Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A \"run-through\"...? Oldbag: They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon. Phoenix: (So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...) Edgeworth: If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag: I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of \"errands\"? Oldbag: Oh, well, you know. Phoenix: Answer the question! Oldbag: Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know? Phoenix: O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station? Oldbag: Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job! Phoenix: (I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...) Oldbag: Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years. Maya: Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too! Phoenix: You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty. Maya: Not a bad idea...Oldbag: Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you see the victim then? Oldbag: Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station. Edgeworth: Tell us what happened next.Oldbag: I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second? Oldbag: O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper! Phoenix: No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday... Oldbag: I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper! Maya: \"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick. Phoenix: Why don't you raise an objection? Judge: So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag: Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How did you know that? Oldbag: Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag: Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: 2:00? You're sure? Oldbag: Sure as spit! Judge: Well, who was the man!? Oldbag: Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something. Judge: ... Oldbag: Now, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Oldbag: It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw Mr. Powers? Oldbag: That's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny? Maya: Nick, this is your chance! Phoenix: Yeah, time to pull out the secret weapon... Oldbag: I'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Maya: Nick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix: Windbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya: Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag: I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... Oldbag: Whippersnapper! Phoenix: (Hey, I haven't said anything yet!) Oldbag: I'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry... Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness! Phoenix: (I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag: That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who was present at the run-through? Oldbag: Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me. Judge: And what exactly were you doing? Oldbag: Observing! Just... observing. Phoenix: What about the assistant? Oldbag: Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such. Phoenix: (So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag: I saw Powers trip and fall!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Trip and fall\"...? Oldbag: Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course. Judge: You... helped make it better? Oldbag: I kissed it where it hurt. Judge: L-let's just skip over that part, shall we? Phoenix: Where was the assistant then? Oldbag: Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Edgeworth: You may continue your testimony.Oldbag: He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He broke a prop? Oldbag: Sure did! His own Samurai Spear. Phoenix: (His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?) Oldbag: Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it. Phoenix: (This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.) Samurai Spear updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: He broke a prop? Oldbag: Sure did! His own Samurai Spear. Phoenix: (His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?) Oldbag: Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it. Phoenix: (This strikes me as a significant detail...)Oldbag: Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained? Oldbag: Not so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch. Phoenix: (Thus the nap...) Oldbag: Anyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked. Phoenix: (Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag: You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...) Judge: Hmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot. Oldbag: See! And you didn't trust me!

    "cot": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given Turnabout Samurai case. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the testimonies and evidences provided. The testimonies in question are from Oldbag, the security lady. The relevant testimony here is Testimony 3: \"If they had, I would have seen them!\" She's claiming that if anyone else went to the studio, she would have noticed.\n\nLooking at the evidence, one key piece is Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo. The photo shows the Steel Samurai walking towards the studio at 2:00 PM, dragging one leg. Oldbag uses this to argue it was Powers. However, another piece of evidence is the security camera data. The photo's timestamp is 2:00 PM, but there's also the possibility that someone else could have entered without her noticing, especially considering the broken drain grate (Evidence 7) or other entries. \n\nWait, but the user provided a list of evidence. Let me check again. The specific contradiction here would be that Oldbag claims she saw no one else, but there's evidence suggesting someone else could have entered. Wait, but in the testimonies provided, Testimony 3 is her assertion that she would have seen anyone else. The key evidence contradicting this is the security camera photo (Evidence 5), but also maybe the drain grate. However, the drain grate is Evidence 7, but in the given list, Evidence 7 is the Empty Bottle/Sleeping Pill Bottle. Hmm. Wait, the list here shows Evidence 5 as Powers'(?) Photo, which is the photo of the Steel Samurai. \n\nThe contradiction here is that Oldbag claims she would have seen anyone else, but the photo actually shows someone (presumed to be Powers) entering the studio. However, the actual contradiction comes from the fact that the photo shows the Steel Samurai, but there's another way into the studio, such as through the drain. The Security Camera's photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai entering, but if someone else was in the costume, then Oldbag's testimony that she saw no one else is contradicted because she did see someone (the Steel Samurai), but it might not have been Powers. Wait, but the Samurai's costume is the same, so she assumes it's Powers. However, the actual contradiction might be that the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) was broken and repaired with duct tape. The photo shows the Steel Samurai dragging his leg, which Oldbag attributes to Powers' injury. But if the real killer was someone else in the costume, they might not have the injury, but the photo shows the leg drag. However, the duct tape on the spear (Evidence 6) indicates that the spear was broken and fixed, which could imply that the real spear was the murder weapon, but maybe the original broken one was used as a prop. \n\nWait, the key contradiction here is that Oldbag testifies that if anyone else had gone to the studio, she would have seen them. But the drain grate (Evidence 3?) was removed, allowing someone else to enter without passing the main gate. Wait, looking at the evidences, Evidence 2 is the Guidemap. Evidence 3 is Jack's Autopsy Report. Evidence 4 is the Cardkey. Evidence 5 is the Photo. Evidence 6 is the Samurai Spear. Evidence 7 is the Empty Bottle. Then, the drain grate is mentioned in the story as being removed, but in the evidence list, perhaps it's not listed. Wait, the user's evidence list includes:\n\nEvidence 0: Attorney's Badge\nEvidence 1: Powers's Letter\nEvidence 2: Guidemap\nEvidence 3: Jack's Autopsy Report\nEvidence 4: Cardkey\nEvidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo\nEvidence 6: Samurai Spear\n... etc.\n\nThe drain grate and other elements like the bike or the broken statue head are part of the story but not listed as evidence here. The key contradiction would be between Oldbag's testimony that no one else entered (Testimony 3: \"If they had, I would have seen them!\") and the fact that the drain grate was removed, allowing someone else to enter without passing the security gate. However, in the given evidence list, the drain grate is not listed. Wait, the evidence list includes Evidence 7: Empty Bottle \u2192 Sleeping Pill Bottle, which is found in the employee area. The drain grate is part of the environment in the story but perhaps not part of the evidence presented here. \n\nWait, in the story, Phoenix and Maya examine the drain grate and note that it's been removed. However, in the evidence list provided by the user, there's no mention of the drain grate. Therefore, perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere. \n\nAnother angle: The photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai entering at 2:00 PM, but Oldbag claims she saw Powers. However, the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) was broken and repaired with duct tape, which Oldbag herself fixed. If the spear was broken and then used in the murder, the duct tape repair would be present. However, in the crime scene, the spear used was the repaired one. But this might not directly contradict her testimony. \n\nWait, the key contradiction is that Oldbag says she would have seen anyone else, but the presence of the photo (Evidence 5) shows that the Steel Samurai entered at 2:00 PM, but if Powers was asleep, then someone else was in the costume. But how does that contradict her testimony? She did see the Steel Samurai (Powers, in her view) enter, but if it was someone else, then her testimony that no one else entered is incorrect. However, her testimony is that the only person she saw entering was Powers. The contradiction could be that the photo shows the Steel Samurai, but the actual person in the costume could have been someone else. However, she assumes it's Powers because of the leg drag, which Powers had due to his injury. But if someone else imitated the leg drag, that's possible. However, the evidence that contradicts her is that the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) was broken and repaired with duct tape, implying that the original spear was broken and thus the murder weapon was the same one. But this might not directly contradict her testimony. \n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is in her statement that she saw Powers (because the person was dragging their leg) but the autopsy report (Evidence 3) states the time of death as 2:30 PM, and the photo was taken at 2:00 PM. If the person in the photo is the killer, they would have had to be there before the murder. But Oldbag's testimony is that the only person she saw was Powers, hence the contradiction. Wait, but the problem is between the evidence and the testimony. The testimony in question is Testimony 3: \"If they had, I would have seen them!\" which is her assertion that no one else could have entered. But if there's evidence that someone else did enter, that would contradict her. \n\nIn the story, the drain grate was removed, allowing someone to enter through the drain. However, the drain grate is not part of the evidence here. The user's evidence list includes Evidence 2: Guidemap, which shows the layout, but that's not directly contradictory. \n\nLooking back, the user's question is about which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The options are the given evidences and testimonies. \n\nTestimony 3 is Oldbag's claim that she would have seen anyone else. The contradiction would be if there's evidence that someone else entered without her seeing. However, the photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai entering, which she attributes to Powers. If someone else was in the costume, then her testimony is incorrect. But how does the evidence contradict that? \n\nAlternatively, the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) was broken and repaired, which Oldbag herself fixed. The spear used in the murder was the same one, which was in Powers' possession. But if Powers was asleep, then the spear should have been in his dressing room, implying someone else took it. However, the evidence here is the spear itself, which is the murder weapon. \n\nWait, the key contradiction here is between Oldbag's testimony that she would have seen anyone else (Testimony 3) and the existence of the security camera photo (Evidence 5). The photo shows someone entering, which Oldbag believes is Powers, but if that person was someone else in the costume, then her testimony is contradicted because she claims no one else went there. However, she did see someone (the Steel Samurai), but she assumes it's Powers. Therefore, the contradiction is not between her testimony and the photo, but perhaps between the photo and the fact that Powers was asleep. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again. \n\nThe user's answer needs to be in the form of {\"evidence\": X, \"testimony\": Y}. The possible pairs are from the given list. \n\nTestimony 3: Oldbag says if anyone else went, she would have seen them. \n\nThe evidence that contradicts this would be something proving someone else entered without her knowledge. The drain grate is part of the story but not listed as evidence. The key evidence here is the Powers'(?) Photo (Evidence 5), which shows the Steel Samurai entering, but if the real killer was someone else in the costume, then Oldbag's testimony is contradicted because she didn't realize it wasn't Powers. However, she does claim that the person in the photo is Powers because of the leg drag, which is due to his injury. \n\nWait, but the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) was repaired with duct tape. Oldbag testified that she fixed the spear when Powers broke it during the run-through. The murder weapon is the same spear. If Powers was the one who used it, that makes sense. But if someone else used it, then the contradiction would be that the spear was in Powers' possession, so how did someone else get it? \n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is that Oldbag claims she saw Powers entering the studio (Testimony 1 and 3), but the Cardkey (Evidence 4) found in Powers' dressing room suggests he was there, implying he couldn't have left. Wait, the cardkey is for Studio One, and if he was asleep in his dressing room, then the cardkey would still be there. But the photo shows someone using the cardkey to enter Studio One, which would require the cardkey. If the real killer took the cardkey from Powers' room, then Powers couldn't have entered Studio One without it. Therefore, the presence of the Cardkey (Evidence 4) in the dressing room contradicts Oldbag's testimony that Powers entered the studio (as he wouldn't have the cardkey to enter). \n\nWait, but in the story, Phoenix takes the cardkey from Powers' dressing room. If the cardkey was there, then Powers couldn't have used it to enter Studio One, which requires the cardkey. Therefore, the person in the photo must have had a different cardkey, implying it wasn't Powers. Therefore, the contradiction is between the Cardkey (Evidence 4) being in Powers' room and Oldbag's testimony that he entered Studio One (which requires the cardkey). \n\nBut looking at the testimony: Testimony 3 is \"If they had, I would have seen them!\" which is about others entering. The Cardkey evidence would relate to Testimony 1 (\"The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\") but the user's question is about Testimony 3. \n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Oldbag claims she would have seen anyone else) and the fact that the drain grate was removed, allowing someone else to enter. But the drain grate is not listed as evidence here. \n\nAlternatively, the photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai entering, but the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) being repaired with duct tape indicates that the spear was broken and fixed. If the spear was broken and then used in the murder, the repair job by Oldbag would be part of the evidence. But how does this contradict her testimony? \n\nWait, Oldbag's testimony that she saw Powers entering is based on the leg drag in the photo. But if the real killer was someone else imitating the injury, then her testimony is wrong. But there's no evidence here that directly shows someone else could have had the injury. \n\nHmm. The correct contradiction here is likely between Oldbag's Testimony 3 (\"If they had, I would have seen them!\") and the fact that the security camera photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai entering, but the actual person in the costume could have been someone else. However, since the photo is the only evidence of someone entering, and Oldbag's claim is that no one else entered, the contradiction would be that the photo shows someone entering, which she attributes to Powers, but the real killer could be another person. However, this is more of a logical inconsistency rather than a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony. \n\nAlternatively, the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) being repaired with duct tape shows that it was broken and fixed by Oldbag. The murder weapon is the same spear, implying that the killer had access to the repaired spear. If Powers was asleep, then the spear would be in his possession, so the contradiction is that the spear was used by someone else, hence someone else entered. But how does that directly contradict Oldbag's testimony? \n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating this. The most straightforward contradiction is between Oldbag's Testimony 3 (\"If they had, I would have seen them!\") and Evidence 5 (the photo). The photo shows the Steel Samurai entering, but if it wasn't Powers, then someone else entered without her realizing it, contradicting her testimony. However, she did see the Steel Samurai, so she thinks it's Powers. The actual contradiction is that the photo's timestamp is 2:00 PM, but Powers claims he was asleep. Therefore, the photo is not of Powers, meaning someone else entered, which Oldbag didn't account for. But how does that tie into the evidence? \n\nWait, the key point is that the photo shows the Steel Samurai entering at 2:00 PM, but Powers has an alibi (sleeping). The evidence (Cardkey in his room) supports his alibi. Therefore, the photo must be of someone else in the costume. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony that no one else entered is contradicted because someone else did enter (as the Steel Samurai), but she mistook them for Powers. Hence, the contradiction is between her Testimony 3 (claiming she would have seen anyone else) and the photo showing that someone else did enter, but she mistook them for Powers. However, since she did see the person (the Steel Samurai), but thought it was Powers, the actual contradiction is that the person in the photo wasn't Powers, hence someone else entered, which her testimony denies. \n\nTherefore, the correct pair is Evidence 5 (Powers'(?) Photo) contradicting Testimony 3 (Oldbag's assertion she would have seen anyone else). But the photo is the evidence that she uses to claim it was Powers. The contradiction is that the photo actually shows someone else, but she assumes it's Powers. However, without additional evidence, how does the photo contradict her testimony? \n\nAlternatively, the drain grate being open (though not in evidence) allows someone else to enter, but since it's not listed, perhaps the correct answer is the Cardkey (Evidence 4). If the cardkey was in Powers' room, then he couldn't have entered Studio One, which requires the cardkey. Therefore, the person in the photo (Evidence 5) must have used a different cardkey, implying someone else. But the evidence is the Cardkey (4), and the testimony is Oldbag's Testimony 3. Therefore, the contradiction is that the Cardkey being in Powers' room proves he couldn't have entered Studio One, so someone else must have, which Oldbag claims she would have seen (but didn't). \n\nBut how does the Cardkey (4) directly contradict her testimony? Because if the killer needed the cardkey to enter Studio One, and the cardkey was found in Powers' room, then Powers couldn't have entered, implying the killer was someone else who had their own cardkey. Therefore, Oldbag's Testimony 3 (\"If they had, I would have seen them!\") is contradicted by the fact that someone else (with their own cardkey) entered without her seeing, which is possible if they used another entrance (like the drain). But since the drain isn't evidence here, the contradiction would be between the Cardkey (4) and Testimony 3. \n\nWait, but the Cardkey (4) is for Studio One, and if Powers' cardkey was in his room, then he couldn't have entered Studio One, meaning the person in the photo (5) used another cardkey, thus implying someone else entered. Therefore, Oldbag's claim that no one else entered is contradicted by the existence of another cardkey user. But since the cardkey is evidence 4, and testimony 3, the answer would be {\"evidence\":4, \"testimony\":3}.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the photo (5) shows the Steel Samurai entering, but if Powers couldn't have (because his cardkey was in his room), then the photo is of someone else, contradicting Oldbag's testimony that she saw no one else. \n\nBut the cardkey (4) is evidence that Powers couldn't have entered, so the person in the photo (5) must be someone else. Therefore, the contradiction is between the Cardkey (4) and Testimony 3 (Oldbag's claim that she would have seen anyone else). Because the killer had to have a cardkey to enter, but Powers' cardkey was in his room, meaning the killer was someone else with a cardkey, which Oldbag should have seen but didn't. Therefore, the evidence is the Cardkey (4) and testimony is Testimony 3. \n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between the photo (5) and testimony 1 (The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!). But the question asks for testimony 3. \n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 5. The photo shows someone entering, which Oldbag claims is Powers, but if the real killer was someone else, then her testimony is wrong. However, without additional evidence, how is this proven? \n\nWait, in the game, the critical contradiction is that the photo shows the Steel Samurai dragging his leg, which Oldbag attributes to Powers' injury. However, the real injury was on the right leg, but the photo shows the left leg being dragged. This is revealed during the trial. Therefore, the photo (Evidence 5) contradicts Oldbag's testimony that it was Powers because the leg dragged is the wrong one. However, in the given evidence list, the photo's description only mentions dragging a leg, not which one. But in the game, this is the key point. \n\nAssuming the user expects this answer, then the evidence is 5 and testimony is 3. However, based on the given information, the photo's description doesn't specify which leg. But in the game's context, this is the actual contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be {\"evidence\":5, \"testimony\":3}."

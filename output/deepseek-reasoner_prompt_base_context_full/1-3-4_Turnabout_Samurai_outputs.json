    "prompt": "You are provided with a list of characters, evidences and testimonies.\nStory:\n... Powers! Judge: Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of! Edgeworth: ... I understand, Your Honor. Judge: This ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned! October 18, 1:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Will: Th-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me. Maya: Aww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff* Phoenix: We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination! Maya: So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag? Phoenix: What do you think, Mr. Powers? Will: I don't think it was her, really. Maya: Neither do I, Nick. Phoenix: Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers. Maya: Poor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her. Phoenix: Well, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios. Maya: Right! We'll be back to visit you soon... Will: Th-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff* To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. Phoenix: (W-what!? I see plenty of room! It\u2019s still wide open... no?) Judge: This court find the defendant, Mr. Will Powers... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Samurai Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 October 18Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Whew, what a day. Maya: This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance? Phoenix: I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial. Maya: The director and producer...? Phoenix: Yeah, them. Maya: Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios! Talk What to do Phoenix: What do you think we should do? Maya: W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer. Phoenix: Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here. Maya: That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto! Any ideas Maya: Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet. Phoenix: That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened. Maya: There's not enough information! Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, see this? Maya: You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick? Cardkey Maya: Hey, you still have that! Great! Phoenix: Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell... Maya: Poor old WP... Powers's(?) Photo Maya: You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers? Phoenix: Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag. Maya: So Mr. Powers is... lying? Phoenix: He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...) Samurai Spear Maya: I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick! Phoenix: Me!? Why me!? Anything else Maya: Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out. October 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room Will: Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier. Phoenix: Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth. Maya: You can say that again! Phoenix: Let's not. Maya: So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction? Will: Hmm... S-sorry, but no. Maya: Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small. Phoenix: We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow. Will: Y-yes... *sniff* Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Do, er, \"fanboys\" sneak into the studios often? Will: No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them. Maya: But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around? Will: The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess. The director Phoenix: Was the director present at the morning run-through? Will: Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move. Maya: Why didn't you tell us that before!? Will: W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet... Maya: That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big! Will: I... I see. *sniff* Phoenix: (Whose side is she on!?) Maya: You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!? Will: N-no, I sure hope not. Present Cardkey Phoenix: We found this cardkey in your dressing room. Will: Oh, that's mine, yes. Maya: Can people outside the studios get these cards? Will: I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is. Maya: Huh... Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Regarding this photograph... Will: Y-yes...? Phoenix: This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right? Will: R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest. Phoenix: But who else could have worn it!? Maya: Your costume was in your dressing room? Will: Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep. Phoenix: (But who!?) Samurai Spear Phoenix: Regarding the murder weapon... Will: Yes? Phoenix: Is it heavy, that spear? Will: It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively. Phoenix: Hmm... Maya: And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through? Will: Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though. Maya: With duct tape. We heard. Anything else Will: E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff* October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain Gate Maya: No one's here. Phoenix: Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her... Maya: H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them! Examine Computer Phoenix: The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day. Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. Main gate Phoenix: The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there. October 18Studio One Entrance Maya: Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today. Phoenix: You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial. Maya: So, Nick... Remember that \"Studio Two\" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right? Phoenix: Yeah, I think that's what they said. Maya: Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out! Examine Bench Phoenix: I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit. Maya: This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever. Phoenix: H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired! Maya: Nick, when you start having to say \"I'm still young,\" you know it's all over. Phoenix: (But... but I AM still young!) Left path Phoenix: In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem. Maya: This monkey head is real heavy! Phoenix: Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell. Maya: Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they. Phoenix: Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said. Statue with broken head Phoenix: The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before! Maya: Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant? Phoenix: I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing. Maya: Probably so. Security camera Phoenix: That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today. Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. Welcome sign Maya: It says \"Welcome.\" Phoenix: They let people in here when they're not filming, right? Maya: Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say? Phoenix: Sure, if that security lady lets us in. October 18Studio One Maya: I... don't really want to be in here. Phoenix: Yeah... It is a murder scene. Maya: I want to go someplace else. Nick? Phoenix: (*sigh*...) Examine Film camera Maya: Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton! Phoenix: Yeah! So don't touch it! Maya: Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star! Phoenix: S-stop that! Reflecting screen Phoenix: That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. Maya: Huh. Phoenix: What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment? Maya: Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: (I think she's being serious...!) Stage backdrop Phoenix: Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show. Maya: Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama! Phoenix: Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there? Maya: Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo! October 18Studio Two Entrance Maya: This... is Studio Two? Phoenix: I thought so... Maya: It doesn't really look much like a \"studio,\" does it? Phoenix: No, that it does not. Maya: Hey... There's a trailer over there. Phoenix: It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer. Maya: Are we sure this is a studio? Examine Incinerator Phoenix: An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much. Lunch table Phoenix: Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates. Maya: Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too. Phoenix: What is it with steaks around here? Maya: Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place... Phoenix: What? Maya: I... don't know. It just feels \"odd.\" Number \"2\" sign Phoenix: There's a big \"2\" painted here. Maya: Probably because this is Studio Two? Phoenix: Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio. Studio van Phoenix: A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine. Maya: Well, let's go for a drive! Phoenix: Sure... if I had a license. Maya: Nick! You don't have a driver's license!? Phoenix: But, look, I have this! Maya: Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick? Flower garden Phoenix: There're some flowers here. Maya: Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these. Phoenix: Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous. Storage materials Phoenix: These look like materials for making a movie set. Maya: They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard. Trailer Phoenix: On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set. Trailer door Maya: Nick! Let's go inside! Phoenix: You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked. Maya: Aww... shucks. October 18Global StudiosEmployee Area Maya: Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey! Penny: Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys! Phoenix: Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it. Penny: Is it true they caught the security lady!? Phoenix: Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh! Penny: Actually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain... Phoenix: You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...) Penny: I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right? Maya: Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right? Penny: R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them. Maya: Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about! Penny: You're right! I won't! Phoenix: (Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...) Penny: Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag. Maya: Right! See you later, then! Penny: Good luck with your investigation. Examine Taped cardboard barrier Maya: So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain? Phoenix: So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry. Maya: Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in. Phoenix: Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...? Maya: I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you? Phoenix: What, you want to rip the grate off? Maya: Really, Nick? We can!? Phoenix: (Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...) Rip it open Phoenix: Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken. Maya: Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes. Phoenix: (Sometimes...?) Maya: Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy. Phoenix: The things we do... Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who. Maya: Yeah... I guess so. Phoenix: (Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...) Leads back to examination Drain grate (after selecting \"Rip it open\" upon examining taped cardboard barrier) Phoenix: The drain grate is off. And I know who did it. Maya: Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that? Phoenix: (Must be nice to live so free of guilt.) Lunch table Phoenix: The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak. Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Maya: Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal? Phoenix: H-hey! We're not thieves! Maya: But we did take that cardkey... Phoenix: W-we borrowed that! There's a difference. Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least! Maya: W-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this! Phoenix: Be my guest. Maya: Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out. October 18Global StudiosDressing Room Maya: This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder. Phoenix: That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping. Maya: But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then? Phoenix: Huh... (She's got a point!) Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show... Maya: \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey,\" Nick! Get with the picture! Phoenix: Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!? Maya: I, um, kinda like samurai movies. Phoenix: (\"Kinda\"...?) Costume rack Phoenix: There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes. Couch Phoenix: Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said. Bag Maya: Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked. Phoenix: Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!) Table Phoenix: There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies... Maya: Wait... Nick! Phoenix: W-what now? Maya: These snacks... they've passed the expiration date! Phoenix: ... Then don't eat them. Maya: *grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!) Window Phoenix: It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside. Studio - Main Gate (after selecting \"Rip it open\" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area) Penny: Oh... hello. Maya: Ho hoh! You look a little out of place. Penny: It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an \"alternative guard fashion\" thing. Examine Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras. Penny: Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew. Talk The studios Phoenix: So, how are the studios doing? Penny: There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me \"disturbing evidence.\" I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder! Phoenix: You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area? Penny: Yeah. Can you believe it? The fanboy Maya: Do kids sneak in here a lot? Penny: Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though... The director, et al. Phoenix: I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder... Penny: Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet. Maya: So they were trying to protect the director? Penny: More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer! Phoenix: (The producer, huh?) Present Cardkey Penny: Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys? Phoenix: Well, I'm sort of borrowing it. Penny: I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here. Phoenix: (I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful. Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Could you take a look at this? Penny: That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway? Phoenix: (Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind. Samurai Spear Phoenix: Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon... Penny: You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around. Phoenix: (So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?) Anything else Penny: Umm... Not really sure what that is. Sorry. Dressing Room (after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option in Global Studios - Main Gate) ???: WTF? Who are j00 d00dz!? LMAO! Maya: H-huh!? W-we... Wait, you first! Who are you!? You look pretty suspicious to me! ???: Whatever, l4m3rs! Manella: How can j00 not know the great Sal Manella!? I make teh L33T SH0WZ! The Steel Samurai? Mine! RTFC! (Read The Film Credits!) Maya: R-really!? You're THE Sal Manella!? I'm so sorry! I, just, you looked so... Sorry! Manella: No no, quite alright. Really. It's fine. ROFL! ... Maya: W-what is it? Manella: You know, on closer inspection... Mmm... Yeah... Hot! Hot! Hot! *slobber* Hey, do j00 do a lot of \"cosplay,\" coz that costume r0x0rz!... *drool* Maya: Rocksores!? Wh-wh-what... Hey! You're drooling! Manella: Huh? Mmph! LOL! Buffer overrun! *pant* You've triggered my CR34T1V3 P0W3RZ! Yes... yes, it's coming to me! \"Pink Princess\"! The sequel to the Steel Samurai... \"Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo!\" ROFL... LMAO! Phoenix: P-\"Pink Princess\"...? Maya: Why's it gotta be \"Little\" Olde Tokyo!? Why can't it have a cool name, like \"Neo Olde Tokyo\"!? Phoenix: Maya, we really need to talk about \"cool\"... Examine Table Phoenix: There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Maya: H-hey! Nick! Phoenix: W-what now? Maya: Th-the snacks! There was twice this much here before! Manella: Ah. I, uh, I ate them. They were past their expiration date anyway. ROFL! Maya: ... Phoenix: (She's biting her lip and staring at me with tears welling in her eyes...) Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder? Manella: Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh? Phoenix: That's right. Manella: It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch!\u00a0:( Phoenix: A t-bone steak, was it? Manella: Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food... Maya: Nick... what does \"Sucksores\" mean? Phoenix: No idea... Manella: Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network. Phoenix: (Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...) The producer (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: About the producer who was at the meeting with you... Manella: Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right? Manella: Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time. The bigwigs (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: Who exactly are these \"bigwigs\" people keep mentioning? Manella: Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats* Phoenix: Were all of them with you the entire time? Manella: Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl* Phoenix: (Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.) Present Powers's(?) Photo Manella: ... T-this is WP, right? Phoenix: How do you know? Manella: Well, look, he's obviously dragging his foot. Phoenix: (Oh, right. The director would know about the injury; he was there.) Anything else Manella: I try not to pay much attention to things that don't interest me. LOL. Maya: W-why are you staring at me like that...? October 18Studio Two Entrance Phoenix: (This place is deserted...) *crash!* Maya: Eek! N-N-Nick! W-w-what was that noise!? It sounded like it came from inside the trailer... Phoenix: Someone must be inside... Maya: H-Hello? ... Phoenix: No answer. Maya: Pretty suspicious, if you ask me, Nick! Let's go in! Phoenix: I'm not sure we should be barging in... ...Huh. It's locked. Maya: What? Don't we have a key? Phoenix: No. But there's probably one in the guard station at the main gate. Maya: Then what are we waiting for? Let's borrow it! Phoenix: (If they'll let us...) Examine Trailer door Phoenix: The trailer door. It's locked. The key is probably in the security guard station. I doubt they'd let us borrow it. Studio - Main Gate (after visiting Studio Two Entrance and visiting Global Studios - Dressing Room after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option in Global Studios - Main Gate) Oldbag: Ah hah! You again! Maya: Eeeek! Oldbag: How rude, acting like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: You... certainly got back to your post quickly. Oldbag: Oh the police took me away, they did. They pulled out a spare Steel Samurai costume! Told me to \"put it on.\" Can you imagine? How could I, a sweet little old lady, wear a giant suit like that? Phoenix: Mr. Powers is pretty tall... Oldbag: As soon as they saw there was no way I could wear it, they let me go. Phoenix: (I guess that would rule out her being the murderer.) Oldbag: Anyway! Know this, whippersnapper! This old lady NEVER forgets a slight or insult! And you won't get any information out of me! My lips are sealed! Maya: You sure are talking a lot for someone with sealed lips. Oldbag: Starting now! One, two, three, mmmph! Phoenix: (This lady's too much...) Examine Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras. Oldbag: Hey! No touching! Phoenix: (Guess I'd better investigate there later...) Talk The Fanboy Phoenix: Umm, about that kid you said you saw... Oldbag: If I see him again, I'm taking him down! Maya: N-Nick! Look at her eyes! She's serious! The director, et al. Phoenix: About the dirctor, the one who was here on the day of the murder... Oldbag: If I see him again, I'm taking him down! Maya: Nick! I think she's losing it! Present Anything Phoenix: (I have a feeling she's not going to respond well to anything I show her now.) Employee Area (after visiting Studio Two Entrance and visiting Global Studios - Dressing Room after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option at Global Studios - Main Gate, then revisiting Global Studios - Main Gate) Maya: Hey! H-hey! Wait! Phoenix: (I'll bet he came in right through that drain...) Maya: Hey, um, kiddy-o! What's yer name, sport? ???: I'm not a kid, so don't talk to me like that! Maya: H-huh!? But you... You are a kid! What a rude little brat. That's no way to talk to an adult! ???: I don't see no adults here! Hippie fashion chick! Maya: H-hippie fashion...? Nick... I think I'm being mocked. Phoenix: (You got to hand it to Maya, she's pretty sharp. And pretty mad...) Cody: I'm Cody! Cody Hackins. Call me \"kiddy-o\" again and I'll cut you down where you stand, evildoer! Examine Drain grate Phoenix: The drain where the fanboy came in. He didn't waste any time coming in, either. Talk about cause and effect. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: So, you're a fan of the Steel Samurai? Cody: How dare you utter that name, evildoer! Maya: What do you mean? We're on the Steel Samurai's side! Cody: H-hah! Hah hah! You can't fool me! Maya: Okay... then what's the last line said by the innkeeper in Episode 8? Cody: Hah! Easy! \"Like some fries with that?\" Maya: Hmph... not bad, kiddy-o. Cody: Watch it! Phoenix: (What are they doing!?) What happened Leads to: \"Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day?\" Present Anything Cody: Evildoers! Phoenix: Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day? Cody: ... Maya: You were here, weren't you? Cody: ... Phoenix: Did you see anything...? Cody: He... he... Phoenix: ? Cody: He... always... The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Yeah, I saw 'em! I saw everything! Maya: What!? Cody: But... but no way am I telling you losers! Maya: Wha--!? Wait... Cody: Lemme go! Maya: ... He's gone. Huh? Something fell off the table when he bumped into it on his way out. Phoenix: A... bottle? Why was this sitting there, I wonder? Empty Bottle slipped into pocket. Phoenix: Anyway, what was that kid saying? Maya: He \"saw everything\"... Studio - Main Gate Maya: Huh? Where's that old windbag? Phoenix: Odd of her to leave her post... Oldbag: (H-hey!!!) Maya: Nick! That was her! Oldbag: (S-stop! Whippersnapper!) Phoenix: Y-yeah. Sounds like she's chasing after that boy. Oldbag: Natch! Maya: Uh oh, she tripped! Phoenix: (Maya sure looks happy...) Examine Guard station Maya: Hey, hey, Nick. Now's our chance! Let's check out the guard station! Phoenix: Good idea. Maya: ... Oh! This is it, Nick! The \"Trailer Key\"! Phoenix: The key to that trailer in Studio Two! Maya: We'll be borrowing this, right, Nick? Trailer Key slipped into pocket. (Changed from [Trailer Key slipped into your pocket.] in the original release) Guard station (subsequent times) Phoenix: The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. Outside Studio Two (after examining guard station in Global Studios - Main Gate) Examine Trailer door Phoenix: I wonder if the key we borrowed from the guard station will work? ... It opened. Maya: Great! Let's go, Nick! Phoenix: (She seems eager all of a sudden...) Maya: Well, you first, Nick! Phoenix: (Ah, not THAT eager.) Trailer door (subsequent times) Phoenix: The trailer door. It's unlocked. After examining trailer door in Studio Two Entrance: October 18Studio Two Trailer ???: ... Maya: Eek! S-someone's in here! ???: Names. Maya: O-our n-names? Um, w-we're WP's lawyers, and, um... ???: I see. ... Maya: A-and who might you...? Vasquez: Dee Vasquez. The producer. Phoenix: (Dee Vasquez... She's quite beautiful.) Examine Left poster Phoenix: Another old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads? Maya: Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know. Phoenix: Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet? Middle poster Phoenix: \"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster's quite old. Maya: Wow! It's been years since I saw that show! It was one of those typical summer romance stories... but it was great! Phoenix: A typical summer romance... with a samurai on a horse? Right poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. \"'Dynamite Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" I guess Mr. Hammer used to be quite the star. Table Phoenix: This is where they had that meeting. There are documents and paper cups scattered around. Trash can Phoenix: Nothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents. Whiteboard Phoenix: It looks like they were designing a set to use for the Steel Samurai show. They've got some figures for how much the set costs... I can't believe they spend that much money on those sets! Window Phoenix: The glass is frosted. I can't see outside. This far into October, the dimming daylight makes it feel like winter's coming. Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: I was wondering if you could tell me about the day of the murder... Vasquez: ... ... Phoenix: M-Ms. Vasquez? Vasquez: Script. Phoenix: E-excuse me? Vasquez: Script. I'm looking for a script. Phoenix: A s-script? Vasquez: \"The Steel Samurai, Episode 13.\" I need it. Maya: Umm... could we ask you a bit about the day of the murder? Vasquez: I need to read it. ... Maya: ... Phoenix: ... (We're getting nowhere fast.) The Steel Samurai Maya: Um, w-we'd really like to ask you about the Steel Samurai! Vasquez: ... ... Phoenix: Ms. Vasquez? Vasquez: It's on TV. Every week. That's all I have to say about that. Maya: N-Nick! She's telling us to go watch TV!? The nerve of her! Phoenix: Hey, don't get mad at me. The director Phoenix: About the director... Sal Manella, was it? What, er, exactly is his role here...? Vasquez: Perhaps I didn't make myself clear? I'm looking for a script. I can't be bothered with anything else. ... Maya: Nick? Are all people in the entertainment business this... weird? Phoenix: It's starting to look like it. Present Anything Vasquez: I'm not interested. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: Nick, let's get out of here. Isn't there someplace else we have to check? Phoenix: Y-yeah. Vasquez: Wait. Phoenix: Y-yes? Vasquez: If you see Manella, give him this. Maya: W-why do we have to do your errands...! Vasquez: ... Maya: ... Vasquez: ... Maya: I... I don't think I like her. *sniff* Phoenix: Don't cry. She'll take it as a sign of weakness. Alright. We'll give it to him if we see him. Vasquez's Memo added to the Court Record. Dressing Room Present Vasquez's Memo Phoenix: Here. I got this from the producer... Manella: Huh? \"Bring the script for Episode 13\"? Episode 13... where did I put that one? ... I must have left it somewhere... *sweats* U-uh oh... My ass is p0wned if I don't find it... *shakes* Maya: Nick... It might be quicker to just look in all the places where he's likely to have been. Phoenix: I agree. Inside Studio One (after presenting Vasquez's Memo in Global Studios - Dressing Room) Maya: We're back at the scene of the crime. Let's find what we need and get out of here quick, Nick. Examine Director's chair Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Phoenix: (The director...!) Maya... Take a look around that chair for me, would you? Remember that script the director was talking about? Didn't he say he'd left it somewhere? Maya: Ahah! Found it, Nick! The script! Phoenix: Good work! Script placed in pocket. Director's chair (subsequent times) Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone! Phoenix: ... Maya: Ready, Nick? Action! Phoenix: (This girl is more troubled than I thought.) Dressing Room Present Script Phoenix: We found your script. Manella: W00t! THX! S-still... I dunno... That woman is to be ph34red when you bring something to her late... Say, um, j00 think j00 d00dz could take it down there for me? THX! Maya: Is that producer really that scary? Phoenix: (Well, she's certainly not NORMAL...) Trailer Talk The blocked path (appears after presenting Script) Leads to: \"On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?\" Present Script Phoenix: Here, we found it! Your script! Vasquez: Ah. Script handed to Dee Vasquez. Vasquez: ... Phoenix: ... Umm... uh... You're not going to talk to us? Vasquez: Quiet. I'm reading. Maya: ...! Just you hold on! What's the big idea!? Who do you think you are anyway!? And, and do you even know who we are!? Vasquez: ... Powers's lawyers? Maya: Umm.... right. Vasquez: Am I a suspect? Maya: N-no, it's just, well, no, but... Vasquez: ... You wanted to know about the day of the murder? Maya: Y-yes. Anything you could tell us would be a big help. Vasquez: ... You know there was a meeting here at noon? Phoenix: Yes. With the director and the people from the network... Vasquez: Correct. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave. Maya: Impossible? Why? Vasquez: The path was blocked. Phoenix: The... path? Phoenix: On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked? Vasquez: You saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct? Phoenix: M-\"Mr. Monkey\"? Vasquez: The monkey with the broken head. Phoenix: Oh, right, that... (What an original name...) Vasquez: Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One. Maya: W-what!? Vasquez: It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story. Phoenix: B-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One! Vasquez: 2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come. Outside Studio One Vasquez: ... That's \"Mr. Monkey.\" When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in \"ooks.\" One \"ook\" per hour. Ook ook ook ook. Always with the ooking. Phoenix: (It IS a monkey, after all.) Vasquez: Check its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke. Maya: ...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15. Phoenix: 2:15...? Vasquez: That's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent. Phoenix: Mr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30... Vasquez: See? Good bye. Mr. Monkey's Head data added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Mr. Monkey data added to the Court Record.] in the original release) Maya: What do we do, Nick? There isn't anyone besides WP who could have killed Hammer! It's over... We're finished! Phoenix: (It sure doesn't look good. Guess we should head back to the office and plan our strategy...) Examine Bench Phoenix: I really want to take a break, but we have work to do! Still, it's kind of sad to see so many empty benches... Kind of like if you threw a party, and nobody came. Left path Phoenix: This is the path that goes to Studio Two. The mascot's head fell right on the path on the day of the murder. The path was completely blocked between 2:00 and 4:00. Mr. Monkey Phoenix: I see. There's a clock and a speaker in the monkey's head. It would usually tell the time by \"ook\"ing. The clock is stopped at 2:15 now. October 18Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Now what... We're fresh out of clues. Everyone's alibi is water-tight. We don't even have any promising leads. Things are looking pretty grim. ???: It's a little early for giving up, don't you think? Phoenix: Huh? ???: You've got one lead... Phoenix: M-Mia! It's you! What took you so long!? Mia: Sorry, Phoenix. Maya has trouble calling me unless she's really in trouble. Phoenix: Right! Oh, wait. I guess that means we're really in trouble. Mia: I'd say so. Phoenix: What did you mean, we have one lead...? Mia: The boy, of course. Cody: Yeah, I saw 'em. I saw everything! Maya: What!? Cody: But...but no way am I telling you losers! Phoenix: I dunno. He didn't sound like he was going to help us at all. Mia: I'm sure you can find some way of bringing him over to your side. Either way, we should get back to the studios. That boy is our last hope, Phoenix. Phoenix: (Thanks, now I'm more worried than I was before...) Examine Houseplant Mia: My poor plant! It looks so... so sluggish! Have you been watering it properly, Phoenix? Phoenix: Um, well, Maya has actually... I think maybe she's giving it too much. Mia: That child! Sorry, Charley. Phoenix: (The plant's name is... Charley?) Movie poster Phoenix: A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. Oh, hey! Mia, what's the name of this movie? Mia: That movie...? Oh! I'd sure like to see that one again! It's, um... What was it, again? S-sorry, it's right on the tip of my tongue... Phoenix: (Let me guess... it's a suspense thriller?) Talk What to do Phoenix: So, what's the best thing to do from here? Mia: We need to get to the studio and talk to that boy. Any ideas Phoenix: So, do you have any ideas about who might have done this? Mia: We don't have enough information to make a case yet. Phoenix: (Where have I heard that phrase before? So THAT's where Maya got it from...) Present Anything Mia: Showing me that isn't going to do any good. You know what they say, \"Dead men don't tell tales.\" Phoenix: (You sure are talking enough!) October 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I guess Mr. Powers is in questioning... Mia: Oh well. Let's try again another day, Phoenix. October 18Global StudiosMain Gate Oldbag: Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... Phoenix: W-what's wrong? Oldbag: Huff... puff... huff... puff... whih... whippersnapper! Phoenix: (She's been chasing that boy this whole time.) Oldbag: Huff... puff... when... when I ca... catch him... I... huff Phoenix: (Sounds like she hasn't had any luck catching him.) Oldbag: Huff... puff... I...  I got a hostage now, whippersnapper! Phoenix: (A \"hostage\"...!?) Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Umm... what happened to the boy? Oldbag: I-if I see him a-again, I'll... huff! L-lay him flat! Huff... puff... Mia: My, what a violent old lady... The director, et al. Phoenix: Actually, I met with the director just now... Oldbag: Eh? Hah... my heart, it don't feel so good. Phoenix: (Is she okay!?) Oldbag: B-before I go, I'd like to v-visit the place where poor H-Hammer died... Phoenix: (Right... she was saying she wanted to visit the studio where he died.) The \"hostage\" Phoenix: What's this about a \"hostage\"? Oldbag: Huff... huff... W-when that boy was running away... ...he dropped this, a-and ran! Huff... huff... H-he'll come back... huff... huff... for this one! Phoenix: (It's kind of hard to understand her with all that huffing and puffing.) Mia: Phoenix! That \"hostage\" might be what we need! Cody might talk to us if we gave him that! Phoenix: (Good idea!) Ms. Oldbag! Might I... Oldbag: No! I'm catching that brat if it's the last thing I do! Mia: Phoenix. Do you have anything you might trade with her? Phoenix: (A trade, hmm... I wonder...?) Present Cardkey Oldbag: H-hey... that... huff... That's a card... huff... Studio One? Phoenix: Right. A cardkey to Studio One. Oldbag: Huff... puff... I... I could visit poor Hammer... I'd like to visit... huff... he died... whew. I was his... his fan. Phoenix: You don't have your own card, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: Studio One isn't my turf. Huff... huff... You'll let me borrow... borrow it, then? Phoenix: (If I give her the cardkey, then I won't be able to get into Studio One...!) Keep the cardkey Phoenix: Sorry, we have our own investigating to do there. Oldbag: Huff... huff... puff. Poo. Phoenix: (Was that last bit a breath, or a pout...?) Leads back to Court Record Lend her the cardkey Leads to: \"Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?\" Powers's(?) Photo Oldbag: I... I told you who I s-saw! Huff! Huff... it... it was Powers! Phoenix: (Well, at least she's consistent...) Trailer Key Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag? I'm borrowing this... just so you know. Oldbag: Oh... o-okay... huff. J-just be sure to... huff... give it b-back... puff. Phoenix: (She's not as demanding when she's exhausted.) Anything else Oldbag: Huff... huff... puff... ... huff... puff... haaah! ... Huff.. huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... hooo! Phoenix: (She's too busy catching her breath to tell me anything!) Mia: Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix? Phoenix: I guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag. Cardkey lent to Ms. Oldbag. Oldbag: ... Listen to me, sonny. I don't like having debts to no whippersnappers. You take this, and we're even. Deal? Phoenix: What's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card? Oldbag: That sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though. Phoenix: Thank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the \"hostage\" she was talking about.) Steel Samurai Card added to the Court Record. Oldbag: Right. I'm off. Phoenix: (There she goes, hobbling off toward the studio...) Outside Studio One Examine Welcome sign Phoenix: \"Welcome\"... I wonder if the murder will make this place famous, too. Inside Studio One Examine Director's chair Phoenix: A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella. Film camera Phoenix: A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure. Reflecting screen Phoenix: A panel for reflecting light. They call it a \"reflecting board\" or something. Stage backdrop Phoenix: A stage backdrop. This is \"Neo Fujiyama,\" according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind. (Step)ladder Phoenix: A perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground. Outside Studio Two Examine Lunch table Phoenix: Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates. Number \"2\" sign Phoenix: There's a big \"2\" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio. Studio van Phoenix: A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine. Flower garden Phoenix: Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation. Storage materials Phoenix: These look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard. Trailer door Phoenix: The door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in. Trailer Examine Left poster Phoenix: Another old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads? Mia: It's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan. Phoenix: A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia. Mia: Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up. Middle poster Phoenix: \"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years. Mia: This is one of Maya's favorite movies. Phoenix: Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one? Mia: That... would be kind of sad. October 18Global StudiosEmployee Area Phoenix: Hey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec! Mia: ... Phoenix... Was that the boy? Phoenix: Yeah. His name's \"Cody Hackins.\" Mia: I think he ran into the dressing room. Examine Bicycle Phoenix: Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point? Mia: It makes it a lot easier to go up hills! Phoenix: Where have I heard that line before...? Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Mia: This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk. Storage room door Phoenix: That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment. Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least! Mia: Look at this! \"Spaghetti in a Soda Can\"...? Phoenix: S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside? Mia: \"Best when slammed.\" I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...? Phoenix: Slamming spaghetti. Right... October 18Global StudiosDressing Room Phoenix: He's sure to be in here somewhere... Found you! Cody: ...! Phoenix: Dammit! He's getting away! Mia: Come back! ... There. He's back. Phoenix: (How did she...!?) Cody: ... Mia: Hey there. Would you mind helping us out? Please? Cody: ... I-I'm Cody. Mia: Hello, Cody. I'm Mia. Mia Fey. Nice to meet you. Cody: Yo. Phoenix: And I'm Phoenix Wright! Cody: Who asked? Mia: Phoenix, you can take it from here. Phoenix: (I'm not so sure I'm qualified...) Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show... Cody: You don't know \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"!? You're even lamer than I thought! Phoenix: (Why does everybody but me know about this show!?) Powers's bag Phoenix: Mr. Powers's bag. Mia: Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings. Phoenix: H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!) Table Phoenix: There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated. Mia: Sorry? What was that about Maya? Phoenix: O-oh, nothing. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the \"bomb.\" Cody: Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: H-hey, watch that attitude! Mia: Phoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid. Cody: Yeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid! What happened Phoenix: So, do you know anything about what happened here? Could you tell me, please? Cody: I don't know nothing! Phoenix: (Hmm... looks like a little persuasion's necessary. Maybe a bribe...?) Present Powers's(?) Photo Cody: Hey, it's the Steel Samurai. Huh? Why's he dragging his foot like that? Where'd you get this, anyway? Samurai Spear Cody: The Samurai Spear! That's totally cool. I wish I had one, too... Phoenix: (This kid and Maya would get along great.) Steel Samurai Card Phoenix: Cody... This look familiar? Cody: Hey! My UR! Phoenix: \"You are\"... huh? Cody: \"U.R.\" You know, \"ultra rare\"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: I'll give you this... IF you help me. Cody: But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: (W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?) Cody: Whatever, I don't need that card. Phoenix: Huh? Cody: I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours. Phoenix: (What!? After I went through all that trouble...) Cody: If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card! Phoenix: \"Really rare\"!? You mean there's something rarer than \"Ultra Rare\"!? Cody: Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks? Anything else Cody: What's that? Bo-ring! Man, how can one person be so lame!? If you were a superhero you'd be Lame-o-man! After clearing \"The blocked path\" Talk option in Studio Two Trailer, then revisiting Wright & Co. Law Offices, then presenting Steel Samurai Card in Global Studios - Dressing Room: October 18Studio Two Trailer Penny: Oh, hi. Phoenix: Hello. What brings you here? Penny: Oh, well, I had to arrange some stuff... Umm... Phoenix: Yes? Penny: The, um, girl with you. Doesn't she seem a little different? Like, is she even the same person as before? Phoenix: Um, nope! She's the same as always. Mia: Same as always. Penny: Okay... whatever you say... Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Have you seen that boy since then? Penny: Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad! Phoenix: Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing? Penny: She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station. Phoenix: (Some people take their jobs a little too seriously.) Mr. Hammer Phoenix: Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer? Penny: Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios. Phoenix: But... his popularity had been waning recently, right? Penny: That's true. Then again, after what happened... Phoenix: After WHAT happened? Penny: Y-you mean, you don't know about Hammer...? Phoenix: No, what? Penny: I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything. What happened (appears after \"Mr. Hammer\") Phoenix: Wait, now you have to tell me. What happened with Hammer? Penny: I-I'm sorry. I'm probably not the one who should tell you. Phoenix: (Uh oh. Why do I get the feeling something's being covered up here?) Present Steel Samurai Card Leads to: \"Do you know anything about this?\" Anything else Penny: Umm... Sorry. I'm really Not sure what that is. Phoenix: Do you know anything about this? Penny: Hey, that's a Steel Samurai trading card. I collect those, actually. I'm one card away from a complete set! Phoenix: A complete set? Penny: Yeah, a set of one of each card. Phoenix: Huh... Penny: ... Wait...Waitwaitwaitwait!!! That's it!!! That's the card I need! You don't know how long I've been looking for it! Phoenix: Uh... Penny: I don't care what kind of girl you might think I am, I need that card! P-please! I beg you! Please trade with me! Phoenix: T-trade with you? Penny: Yes, trade cards! Look, I'll even trade you an Ultra Rare Premium card! Phoenix: Trade me a... huh? Penny: Yes, it's a good deal for your Ultra Rare! Please!!! Mia: Phoenix! Can't you see she's desperate? Phoenix: (W-what's everybody getting so excited about...?) Trade Phoenix: Okay. Leads to: \"Really!? Th-thanks!!!\" Don't trade Phoenix: No... no, I can't. See, this card isn't really even mine. Penny: !!! I... I see. O-of course. Of course it wouldn't be yours. Of course you couldn't trade it with me. Of course I won't ever get that card, ever. Of course I don't even really deserve that card. Mia: Phoenix, do something! She's blacking out! Phoenix: O-o-okay, okay! I'll trade! Leads to: \"Really!? Th-thanks!!!\" Penny: Really!? Th-thanks!!! Then this is for you. URP Card added to the Court Record. Penny: Yaa-hoo! Phoenix: (And there she goes...) Mia: Doesn't doing good things like that make you feel great? Phoenix: Yeah. Yeah, it does. Dressing Room Present URP Card Leads to: \"See this card?\" Phoenix: See this card? Cody: Yeah, so... Wait! That's it!!! That's the last Ultra Rare Premium card I need! C'mon give it to me, please! You gotta give it to me! Phoenix: (Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.) R-right! Okay! How about a trade? Cody: You're on! I'll give you a \"Samurai Spear\" and throw in an \"Evil Magistrate\" to boot!! Phoenix: No no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information. Cody: Huh? You sure? Fine by me! URP Card given to Cody. (Changed from [Gave URP Card to Cody.] in the original release) Mia: Okay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: So... you like the Steel Samurai. Cody: He's so cool! Phoenix: I... I guess. Cody: You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life! Phoenix: (I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...) Cody: You like him too, don'tcha? Phoenix: Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai. Cody: So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is! His kind nature Phoenix: R-right... (C'mon, think of something!) I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy! Cody: Totally! He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten! Phoenix: Yeah... Cody: So, what else do you like about him? Phoenix: (Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...) Leads back to: \"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\" His fighting skills Leads to: \"Got to think of something...\" Will Powers's acting Phoenix: W-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers... Cody: Whoa! That's totally hard-core! Phoenix: (You're calling ME hard-core?) Cody: So, what else do you like about him? Phoenix: (Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...) Leads back to: \"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\" Phoenix: (Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes! Cody: Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album! Phoenix: What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai. Cody: I go to every live performance! Phoenix: (Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?) Cody: I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera! Mia: Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it? Cody: You bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? \"The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory.\" The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady. Mia: Really? Are you sure? Cody: Yeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one. Mia: Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you. \"Path to Glory\" received. Phoenix: (What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!) Mia: ? The Steel Samurai (subsequent times) Phoenix: So... you like the Steel Samurai. Cody: Well, yeah! Duh! He's so strong! Phoenix: I... I guess. Cody: You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life! Phoenix: (I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...) What happened Phoenix: You were here on the day of the... incident, right? Cody: Yeah... Phoenix: Did you see anything unusual? Cody: ... Mia: Cody. Cody: ! Mia: Cody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? \"For great justice\"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too. Cody: I... I saw... I saw everything! Phoenix: (Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.) What you saw (appears after \"The Steel Samurai\" and \"What happened\") Leads to: \"Cody... I need to ask you something very important.\" Present \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Thanks for this. Cody: Hey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay! Phoenix: (Believe me, I wasn't going to...) Phoenix: Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident? Cody: ... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that... Mia: What is it, Cody? Cody: Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that. Phoenix: I... I see. It must have been hard for you. Cody: Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart. Phoenix: (Umm... right.) Mia? Mia: Yes? Phoenix: I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it. Mia: True enough. Phoenix: And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him. Mia: Indeed. Phoenix: So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers! Mia: ... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be \"guilty\" for sure. Phoenix: Let's not call him then... Mia: I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone. ???: Not so fast, pal! Gumshoe: I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct! Cody: No! I ain't going! Waah! Mia: ... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court. Phoenix: W-what're we going to do, Mia! Mia: Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine! Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there! Mia: Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent? I believe Phoenix: Of course he is! Mia: ... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then. Leads to: \"Great! Thanks, Mia!\" I don't know Phoenix: (I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.) Mia: Phoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!? Phoenix: (Uh oh, she's mad.) Mia: Oh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then. Leads to: \"Great! Thanks, Mia!\" Phoenix: Great! Thanks, Mia! Mia: See you soon. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\n-- The Break --Manella: Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What time exactly did you take this break? Manella: Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45. Phoenix: (2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...) Edgeworth: ...Manella: But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What were you doing for those 15 minutes? Manella: Eating my t-bone steak! What else!? Phoenix: There were two plates on the trailer table...? Manella: Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate. Phoenix: (Dee Vasquez... the producer.) Edgeworth: To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella: Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why is that?Press (after pressing first statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Why is that?\"Manella: That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast. Manella: Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia: Well, Phoenix?Phoenix: That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia: All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix: (Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix: Why is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix: What!?Edgeworth: Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia: Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge: Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud Phoenix: (If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility! Judge: Hmm... I suppose you might say that... Phoenix: (Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!) Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: What's your point, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record. Phoenix: The Court Record...? Edgeworth: Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path! Phoenix: Whoa! You're right! Edgeworth: True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! Phoenix: ... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.) Judge: No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round. Leads to: \"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"No, it's impossible. Phoenix: (I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time. Edgeworth: Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth. Judge: What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head! Phoenix: ... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.) Leads to: \"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"Edgeworth: I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix: (Wh-what? It's over?)Judge: Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth: Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge: Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge: Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia: ...Phoenix: What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia: ... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix: M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia: ... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will: Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia: Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will: I... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia: Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth: The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix: (Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth: However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth: Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge: Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth: Will the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody: ...Edgeworth: Witness!Cody: What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!Edgeworth: Mrph...Mia: Cody? Answer his question, okay?Cody: H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!Phoenix: (I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.Edgeworth: M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.Phoenix: (He's having trouble with this \"gentle\" thing.)Edgeworth: You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?Cody: You got a problem with that!?Edgeworth: Please tell us what you saw that day.Cody: What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?Edgeworth: Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.Judge: I prefer \"bearded gentleman\" myself.Phoenix: (A very long day...)Judge: Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.Edgeworth: M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.Phoenix: Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?Cody: Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia: Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.Judge: Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody: I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once. I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day. I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me. I was going for the studio. I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes. When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai! It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy! Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow! If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you. Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge: Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)Cody: ...Phoenix: (This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Witness's Account --Cody: I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You really like the Steel Samurai, huh? Cody: Course I do! I've taped every show! And I go to all the live performances! Phoenix: That's impressive. Have you been to the amusement park? Cody: Course! Duh! My Dad always takes me! Phoenix: (Poor, poor Dad...)Cody: I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was that day the first time you'd been to the studio? Cody: Uh, actually I've been a couple of times. I never manage to get there on a rehearsal day! And that security lady's always yelling... Edgeworth: Right, right. Please continue. Cody: Chill, pops! I'm getting to it! How am I supposed to talk with you cuttin' me off all the time? Geez! Edgeworth: ...Cody: I went through the woods, off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Off the path\"...? Cody: Yeah, you know how the studios are in a valley there? If you go off the path a little, there's woods. That's where I was! Phoenix: I see. Cody: Anyhow...Cody: I was going for the studio.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did nothing unusual happen on your way to the studio? Cody: \"Unusual\"? Phoenix: Did you see this monkey by any chance? Cody: Oh, you mean Mr. Monkey? Yeah I saw him, but his head wasn't busted! Edgeworth: So you went straight to the studio?Cody: I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You got lost in the woods? Cody: Yeah. I couldn't figure out which way I was walking. Man, was I relieved when I saw the blue studio doors. But guess what happened next!Cody: When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The Steel Samurai? Cody: Yeah, he was standing by the studio gate. It looked like he was thinking about something before going in. Then he opened up the gate and went inside. Phoenix: I see. What then?Cody: It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What sort of \"bad guy\" was it? Cody: A guy. A person. Kinda tall. Skinny. Phoenix: Are you sure it was a guy? Cody: ... I dunno. He was kinda far away. Phoenix: (Huh, he's being awfully vague...) Mia: ...Cody: Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened to the bad guy? Cody: Huh? Well... Well, he kinda didn't move. Not a bit. Like he was dead. I-I guess he's a real pro! What a great actor! Phoenix: Y-yes, I suppose he was.Cody: If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"If\" you had your camera? You mean, you weren't carrying your camera then? Cody: N-no, I wasn't. I-it's not like I have it all the time! Phoenix: (Really...?)Present Cody's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange.\"Phoenix: (I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...)Mia: Phoenix.

He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though... The director, et al. Phoenix: I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder... Penny: Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet. Maya: So they were trying to protect the director? Penny: More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!

You are a kid! What a rude little brat. That's no way to talk to an adult! ???: I don't see no adults here! Hippie fashion chick! Maya: H-hippie fashion...? Nick... I think I'm being mocked. Phoenix: (You got to hand it to Maya, she's pretty sharp. And pretty mad...) Cody: I'm Cody! Cody Hackins. Call me \"kiddy-o\" again and I'll cut you down where you stand, evildoer! Examine Drain grate Phoenix: The drain where the fanboy came in. He didn't waste any time coming in, either. Talk about cause and effect. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: So, you're a fan of the Steel Samurai? Cody: How dare you utter that name, evildoer! Maya: What do you mean? We're on the Steel Samurai's side! Cody: H-hah! Hah hah! You can't fool me! Maya: Okay... then what's the last line said by the innkeeper in Episode 8? Cody: Hah! Easy! \"Like some fries with that?\" Maya: Hmph... not bad, kiddy-o. Cody: Watch it! Phoenix: (What are they doing!?) What happened Leads to: \"Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day?\" Present Anything Cody: Evildoers! Phoenix: Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day? Cody: ... Maya: You were here, weren't you? Cody: ... Phoenix: Did you see anything...? Cody: He... he... Phoenix: ? Cody: He... always... The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Yeah, I saw 'em! I saw everything! Maya: What!? Cody: But... but no way am I telling you losers! Maya: Wha--!? Wait... Cody: Lemme go! Maya: ... He's gone. Huh? Something fell off the table when he bumped into it on his way out. Phoenix: A... bottle? Why was this sitting there, I wonder? Empty Bottle slipped into pocket. Phoenix: Anyway, what was that kid saying? Maya: He \"saw everything\"... Studio - Main Gate Maya: Huh? Where's that old windbag? Phoenix: Odd of her to leave her post... Oldbag: (H-hey!!!) Maya: Nick! That was her! Oldbag: (S-stop! Whippersnapper!) Phoenix: Y-yeah. Sounds like she's chasing after that boy. Oldbag: Natch! Maya: Uh oh, she tripped! Phoenix: (Maya sure looks happy...) Examine Guard station Maya: Hey, hey, Nick. Now's our chance! Let's check out the guard station! Phoenix: Good idea. Maya: ... Oh! This is it, Nick! The \"Trailer Key\"! Phoenix: The key to that trailer in Studio Two! Maya: We'll be borrowing this, right, Nick? Trailer Key slipped into pocket. (Changed from [Trailer Key slipped into your pocket.] in the original release) Guard station (subsequent times) Phoenix: The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. Outside Studio Two (after examining guard station in Global Studios - Main Gate) Examine Trailer door Phoenix: I wonder if the key we borrowed from the guard station will work? ... It opened. Maya: Great! Let's go, Nick! Phoenix: (She seems eager all of a sudden...) Maya: Well, you first, Nick! Phoenix: (Ah, not THAT eager.) Trailer door (subsequent times) Phoenix: The trailer door. It's unlocked. After examining trailer door in Studio Two Entrance: October 18Studio Two Trailer ???: ... Maya: Eek! S-someone's in here! ???: Names. Maya: O-our n-names? Um, w-we're WP's lawyers, and, um... ???: I see. ... Maya: A-and who might you...? Vasquez: Dee Vasquez. The producer. Phoenix: (Dee Vasquez... She's quite beautiful.) Examine Left poster Phoenix: Another old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads? Maya: Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know. Phoenix: Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet? Middle poster Phoenix: \"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster's quite old. Maya: Wow! It's been years since I saw that show! It was one of those typical summer romance stories... but it was great! Phoenix: A typical summer romance... with a samurai on a horse? Right poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. \"'Dynamite Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" I guess Mr. Hammer used to be quite the star. Table Phoenix: This is where they had that meeting. There are documents and paper cups scattered around. Trash can Phoenix: Nothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents. Whiteboard Phoenix: It looks like they were designing a set to use for the Steel Samurai show. They've got some figures for how much the set costs... I can't believe they spend that much money on those sets! Window Phoenix: The glass is frosted. I can't see outside. This far into October, the dimming daylight makes it feel like winter's coming. Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: I was wondering if you could tell me about the day of the murder... Vasquez: ... ... Phoenix: M-Ms. Vasquez? Vasquez: Script. Phoenix: E-excuse me? Vasquez: Script. I'm looking for a script. Phoenix: A s-script? Vasquez: \"The Steel Samurai, Episode 13.\" I need it. Maya: Umm... could we ask you a bit about the day of the murder? Vasquez: I need to read it. ... Maya: ... Phoenix: ... (We're getting nowhere fast.) The Steel Samurai Maya: Um, w-we'd really like to ask you about the Steel Samurai! Vasquez: ... ... Phoenix: Ms. Vasquez? Vasquez: It's on TV. Every week. That's all I have to say about that. Maya: N-Nick! She's telling us to go watch TV!? The nerve of her! Phoenix: Hey, don't get mad at me. The director Phoenix: About the director... Sal Manella, was it? What, er, exactly is his role here...? Vasquez: Perhaps I didn't make myself clear? I'm looking for a script. I can't be bothered with anything else. ... Maya: Nick? Are all people in the entertainment business this... weird? Phoenix: It's starting to look like it. Present Anything Vasquez: I'm not interested. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: Nick, let's get out of here. Isn't there someplace else we have to check? Phoenix: Y-yeah. Vasquez: Wait. Phoenix: Y-yes? Vasquez: If you see Manella, give him this. Maya: W-why do we have to do your errands...! Vasquez: ... Maya: ... Vasquez: ... Maya: I... I don't think I like her. *sniff* Phoenix: Don't cry. She'll take it as a sign of weakness. Alright. We'll give it to him if we see him. Vasquez's Memo added to the Court Record. Dressing Room Present Vasquez's Memo Phoenix: Here. I got this from the producer... Manella: Huh? \"Bring the script for Episode 13\"? Episode 13... where did I put that one? ... I must have left it somewhere... *sweats* U-uh oh... My ass is p0wned if I don't find it... *shakes* Maya: Nick... It might be quicker to just look in all the places where he's likely to have been. Phoenix: I agree. Inside Studio One (after presenting Vasquez's Memo in Global Studios - Dressing Room) Maya: We're back at the scene of the crime. Let's find what we need and get out of here quick, Nick. Examine Director's chair Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Phoenix: (The director...!) Maya... Take a look around that chair for me, would you? Remember that script the director was talking about? Didn't he say he'd left it somewhere? Maya: Ahah! Found it, Nick! The script! Phoenix: Good work! Script placed in pocket. Director's chair (subsequent times) Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone! Phoenix: ... Maya: Ready, Nick? Action! Phoenix: (This girl is more troubled than I thought.) Dressing Room Present Script Phoenix: We found your script. Manella: W00t! THX! S-still... I dunno... That woman is to be ph34red when you bring something to her late... Say, um, j00 think j00 d00dz could take it down there for me? THX! Maya: Is that producer really that scary? Phoenix: (Well, she's certainly not NORMAL...) Trailer Talk The blocked path (appears after presenting Script) Leads to: \"On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?\" Present Script Phoenix: Here, we found it! Your script! Vasquez: Ah. Script handed to Dee Vasquez. Vasquez: ... Phoenix: ... Umm... uh... You're not going to talk to us? Vasquez: Quiet. I'm reading. Maya: ...! Just you hold on! What's the big idea!? Who do you think you are anyway!? And, and do you even know who we are!? Vasquez: ... Powers's lawyers? Maya: Umm.... right. Vasquez: Am I a suspect? Maya: N-no, it's just, well, no, but... Vasquez: ... You wanted to know about the day of the murder? Maya: Y-yes. Anything you could tell us would be a big help. Vasquez: ... You know there was a meeting here at noon? Phoenix: Yes. With the director and the people from the network... Vasquez: Correct. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave. Maya: Impossible? Why? Vasquez: The path was blocked. Phoenix: The... path? Phoenix: On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked? Vasquez: You saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct? Phoenix: M-\"Mr. Monkey\"? Vasquez: The monkey with the broken head. Phoenix: Oh, right, that... (What an original name...) Vasquez: Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One. Maya: W-what!? Vasquez: It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story. Phoenix: B-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One! Vasquez: 2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come. Outside Studio One Vasquez: ... That's \"Mr. Monkey.\" When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in \"ooks.\" One \"ook\" per hour. Ook ook ook ook. Always with the ooking. Phoenix: (It IS a monkey, after all.) Vasquez: Check its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke. Maya: ...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15. Phoenix: 2:15...? Vasquez: That's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent. Phoenix: Mr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30... Vasquez: See? Good bye. Mr. Monkey's Head data added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Mr. Monkey data added to the Court Record.] in the original release) Maya: What do we do, Nick? There isn't anyone besides WP who could have killed Hammer! It's over... We're finished! Phoenix: (It sure doesn't look good. Guess we should head back to the office and plan our strategy...) Examine Bench Phoenix: I really want to take a break, but we have work to do! Still, it's kind of sad to see so many empty benches... Kind of like if you threw a party, and nobody came. Left path Phoenix: This is the path that goes to Studio Two. The mascot's head fell right on the path on the day of the murder. The path was completely blocked between 2:00 and 4:00. Mr. Monkey Phoenix: I see. There's a clock and a speaker in the monkey's head. It would usually tell the time by \"ook\"ing. The clock is stopped at 2:15 now. October 18Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Now what... We're fresh out of clues. Everyone's alibi is water-tight. We don't even have any promising leads. Things are looking pretty grim. ???: It's a little early for giving up, don't you think? Phoenix: Huh? ???: You've got one lead... Phoenix: M-Mia! It's you! What took you so long!? Mia: Sorry, Phoenix. Maya has trouble calling me unless she's really in trouble. Phoenix: Right! Oh, wait. I guess that means we're really in trouble. Mia: I'd say so. Phoenix: What did you mean, we have one lead...? Mia: The boy, of course. Cody: Yeah, I saw 'em. I saw everything! Maya: What!? Cody: But...but no way am I telling you losers! Phoenix: I dunno. He didn't sound like he was going to help us at all. Mia: I'm sure you can find some way of bringing him over to your side. Either way, we should get back to the studios. That boy is our last hope, Phoenix. Phoenix: (Thanks, now I'm more worried than I was before...) Examine Houseplant Mia: My poor plant! It looks so... so sluggish! Have you been watering it properly, Phoenix? Phoenix: Um, well, Maya has actually... I think maybe she's giving it too much. Mia: That child! Sorry, Charley. Phoenix: (The plant's name is... Charley?) Movie poster Phoenix: A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. Oh, hey! Mia, what's the name of this movie? Mia: That movie...? Oh! I'd sure like to see that one again! It's, um... What was it, again? S-sorry, it's right on the tip of my tongue... Phoenix: (Let me guess... it's a suspense thriller?) Talk What to do Phoenix: So, what's the best thing to do from here? Mia: We need to get to the studio and talk to that boy. Any ideas Phoenix: So, do you have any ideas about who might have done this? Mia: We don't have enough information to make a case yet. Phoenix: (Where have I heard that phrase before? So THAT's where Maya got it from...) Present Anything Mia: Showing me that isn't going to do any good. You know what they say, \"Dead men don't tell tales.\" Phoenix: (You sure are talking enough!) October 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I guess Mr. Powers is in questioning... Mia: Oh well. Let's try again another day, Phoenix. October 18Global StudiosMain Gate Oldbag: Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... Phoenix: W-what's wrong? Oldbag: Huff... puff... huff... puff... whih... whippersnapper! Phoenix: (She's been chasing that boy this whole time.) Oldbag: Huff... puff... when... when I ca... catch him... I... huff Phoenix: (Sounds like she hasn't had any luck catching him.) Oldbag: Huff... puff... I...  I got a hostage now, whippersnapper! Phoenix: (A \"hostage\"...!?) Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Umm... what happened to the boy? Oldbag: I-if I see him a-again, I'll... huff! L-lay him flat! Huff... puff... Mia: My, what a violent old lady... The director, et al. Phoenix: Actually, I met with the director just now... Oldbag: Eh? Hah... my heart, it don't feel so good. Phoenix: (Is she okay!?) Oldbag: B-before I go, I'd like to v-visit the place where poor H-Hammer died... Phoenix: (Right... she was saying she wanted to visit the studio where he died.) The \"hostage\" Phoenix: What's this about a \"hostage\"? Oldbag: Huff... huff... W-when that boy was running away... ...he dropped this, a-and ran! Huff... huff... H-he'll come back... huff... huff... for this one! Phoenix: (It's kind of hard to understand her with all that huffing and puffing.) Mia: Phoenix! That \"hostage\" might be what we need! Cody might talk to us if we gave him that! Phoenix: (Good idea!) Ms. Oldbag! Might I... Oldbag: No! I'm catching that brat if it's the last thing I do! Mia: Phoenix. Do you have anything you might trade with her? Phoenix: (A trade, hmm... I wonder...?) Present Cardkey Oldbag: H-hey... that... huff... That's a card... huff... Studio One? Phoenix: Right. A cardkey to Studio One. Oldbag: Huff... puff... I... I could visit poor Hammer... I'd like to visit... huff... he died... whew. I was his... his fan. Phoenix: You don't have your own card, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: Studio One isn't my turf. Huff... huff... You'll let me borrow... borrow it, then? Phoenix: (If I give her the cardkey, then I won't be able to get into Studio One...!) Keep the cardkey Phoenix: Sorry, we have our own investigating to do there. Oldbag: Huff... huff... puff. Poo. Phoenix: (Was that last bit a breath, or a pout...?) Leads back to Court Record Lend her the cardkey Leads to: \"Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?\" Powers's(?) Photo Oldbag: I... I told you who I s-saw! Huff! Huff... it... it was Powers! Phoenix: (Well, at least she's consistent...) Trailer Key Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag? I'm borrowing this... just so you know. Oldbag: Oh... o-okay... huff. J-just be sure to... huff... give it b-back... puff. Phoenix: (She's not as demanding when she's exhausted.) Anything else Oldbag: Huff... huff... puff... ... huff... puff... haaah! ... Huff.. huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... hooo! Phoenix: (She's too busy catching her breath to tell me anything!) Mia: Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix? Phoenix: I guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag. Cardkey lent to Ms. Oldbag. Oldbag: ... Listen to me, sonny. I don't like having debts to no whippersnappers. You take this, and we're even. Deal? Phoenix: What's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card? Oldbag: That sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though. Phoenix: Thank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the \"hostage\" she was talking about.) Steel Samurai Card added to the Court Record. Oldbag: Right. I'm off. Phoenix: (There she goes, hobbling off toward the studio...) Outside Studio One Examine Welcome sign Phoenix: \"Welcome\"... I wonder if the murder will make this place famous, too. Inside Studio One Examine Director's chair Phoenix: A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella. Film camera Phoenix: A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure. Reflecting screen Phoenix: A panel for reflecting light. They call it a \"reflecting board\" or something. Stage backdrop Phoenix: A stage backdrop. This is \"Neo Fujiyama,\" according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind. (Step)ladder Phoenix: A perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground. Outside Studio Two Examine Lunch table Phoenix: Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates. Number \"2\" sign Phoenix: There's a big \"2\" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio. Studio van Phoenix: A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine. Flower garden Phoenix: Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation. Storage materials Phoenix: These look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard. Trailer door Phoenix: The door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in. Trailer Examine Left poster Phoenix: Another old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads? Mia: It's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan. Phoenix: A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia. Mia: Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up. Middle poster Phoenix: \"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years. Mia: This is one of Maya's favorite movies. Phoenix: Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one? Mia: That... would be kind of sad. October 18Global StudiosEmployee Area Phoenix: Hey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec! Mia: ... Phoenix... Was that the boy? Phoenix: Yeah. His name's \"Cody Hackins.\" Mia: I think he ran into the dressing room. Examine Bicycle Phoenix: Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point? Mia: It makes it a lot easier to go up hills! Phoenix: Where have I heard that line before...? Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Mia: This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk. Storage room door Phoenix: That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment. Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least! Mia: Look at this! \"Spaghetti in a Soda Can\"...? Phoenix: S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside? Mia: \"Best when slammed.\" I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...? Phoenix: Slamming spaghetti. Right... October 18Global StudiosDressing Room Phoenix: He's sure to be in here somewhere... Found you! Cody: ...! Phoenix: Dammit! He's getting away! Mia: Come back! ... There. He's back. Phoenix: (How did she...!?) Cody: ... Mia: Hey there. Would you mind helping us out? Please? Cody: ... I-I'm Cody. Mia: Hello, Cody. I'm Mia. Mia Fey. Nice to meet you. Cody: Yo. Phoenix: And I'm Phoenix Wright! Cody: Who asked? Mia: Phoenix, you can take it from here. Phoenix: (I'm not so sure I'm qualified...) Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show... Cody: You don't know \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"!? You're even lamer than I thought! Phoenix: (Why does everybody but me know about this show!?) Powers's bag Phoenix: Mr. Powers's bag. Mia: Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings. Phoenix: H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!) Table Phoenix: There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated. Mia: Sorry? What was that about Maya? Phoenix: O-oh, nothing. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the \"bomb.\" Cody: Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: H-hey, watch that attitude! Mia: Phoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid. Cody: Yeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid! What happened Phoenix: So, do you know anything about what happened here? Could you tell me, please? Cody: I don't know nothing! Phoenix: (Hmm... looks like a little persuasion's necessary. Maybe a bribe...?) Present Powers's(?) Photo Cody: Hey, it's the Steel Samurai. Huh? Why's he dragging his foot like that? Where'd you get this, anyway? Samurai Spear Cody: The Samurai Spear! That's totally cool. I wish I had one, too... Phoenix: (This kid and Maya would get along great.) Steel Samurai Card Phoenix: Cody... This look familiar? Cody: Hey! My UR! Phoenix: \"You are\"... huh? Cody: \"U.R.\" You know, \"ultra rare\"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: I'll give you this... IF you help me. Cody: But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: (W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?) Cody: Whatever, I don't need that card. Phoenix: Huh? Cody: I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours. Phoenix: (What!? After I went through all that trouble...) Cody: If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card! Phoenix: \"Really rare\"!? You mean there's something rarer than \"Ultra Rare\"!? Cody: Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks? Anything else Cody: What's that? Bo-ring! Man, how can one person be so lame!? If you were a superhero you'd be Lame-o-man! After clearing \"The blocked path\" Talk option in Studio Two Trailer, then revisiting Wright & Co. Law Offices, then presenting Steel Samurai Card in Global Studios - Dressing Room: October 18Studio Two Trailer Penny: Oh, hi. Phoenix: Hello. What brings you here? Penny: Oh, well, I had to arrange some stuff... Umm... Phoenix: Yes? Penny: The, um, girl with you. Doesn't she seem a little different? Like, is she even the same person as before? Phoenix: Um, nope! She's the same as always. Mia: Same as always. Penny: Okay... whatever you say... Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Have you seen that boy since then? Penny: Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad! Phoenix: Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing? Penny: She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station. Phoenix: (Some people take their jobs a little too seriously.) Mr. Hammer Phoenix: Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer? Penny: Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios. Phoenix: But... his popularity had been waning recently, right? Penny: That's true. Then again, after what happened... Phoenix: After WHAT happened? Penny: Y-you mean, you don't know about Hammer...? Phoenix: No, what? Penny: I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything. What happened (appears after \"Mr. Hammer\") Phoenix: Wait, now you have to tell me. What happened with Hammer? Penny: I-I'm sorry. I'm probably not the one who should tell you. Phoenix: (Uh oh. Why do I get the feeling something's being covered up here?) Present Steel Samurai Card Leads to: \"Do you know anything about this?\" Anything else Penny: Umm... Sorry. I'm really Not sure what that is. Phoenix: Do you know anything about this? Penny: Hey, that's a Steel Samurai trading card. I collect those, actually. I'm one card away from a complete set! Phoenix: A complete set? Penny: Yeah, a set of one of each card. Phoenix: Huh... Penny: ... Wait...Waitwaitwaitwait!!! That's it!!! That's the card I need! You don't know how long I've been looking for it! Phoenix: Uh... Penny: I don't care what kind of girl you might think I am, I need that card! P-please! I beg you! Please trade with me! Phoenix: T-trade with you? Penny: Yes, trade cards! Look, I'll even trade you an Ultra Rare Premium card! Phoenix: Trade me a... huh? Penny: Yes, it's a good deal for your Ultra Rare! Please!!! Mia: Phoenix! Can't you see she's desperate? Phoenix: (W-what's everybody getting so excited about...?) Trade Phoenix: Okay. Leads to: \"Really!? Th-thanks!!!\" Don't trade Phoenix: No... no, I can't. See, this card isn't really even mine. Penny: !!! I... I see. O-of course. Of course it wouldn't be yours. Of course you couldn't trade it with me. Of course I won't ever get that card, ever. Of course I don't even really deserve that card. Mia: Phoenix, do something! She's blacking out! Phoenix: O-o-okay, okay! I'll trade! Leads to: \"Really!? Th-thanks!!!\" Penny: Really!? Th-thanks!!! Then this is for you. URP Card added to the Court Record. Penny: Yaa-hoo! Phoenix: (And there she goes...) Mia: Doesn't doing good things like that make you feel great? Phoenix: Yeah. Yeah, it does. Dressing Room Present URP Card Leads to: \"See this card?\" Phoenix: See this card? Cody: Yeah, so... Wait! That's it!!! That's the last Ultra Rare Premium card I need! C'mon give it to me, please! You gotta give it to me! Phoenix: (Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.) R-right! Okay! How about a trade? Cody: You're on! I'll give you a \"Samurai Spear\" and throw in an \"Evil Magistrate\" to boot!! Phoenix: No no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information. Cody: Huh? You sure? Fine by me! URP Card given to Cody. (Changed from [Gave URP Card to Cody.] in the original release) Mia: Okay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: So... you like the Steel Samurai. Cody: He's so cool! Phoenix: I... I guess. Cody: You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life! Phoenix: (I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...) Cody: You like him too, don'tcha? Phoenix: Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai. Cody: So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is! His kind nature Phoenix: R-right... (C'mon, think of something!) I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy! Cody: Totally! He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten! Phoenix: Yeah... Cody: So, what else do you like about him? Phoenix: (Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...) Leads back to: \"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\" His fighting skills Leads to: \"Got to think of something...\" Will Powers's acting Phoenix: W-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers... Cody: Whoa! That's totally hard-core! Phoenix: (You're calling ME hard-core?) Cody: So, what else do you like about him? Phoenix: (Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...) Leads back to: \"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\" Phoenix: (Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes! Cody: Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album! Phoenix: What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai. Cody: I go to every live performance! Phoenix: (Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?) Cody: I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera! Mia: Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it? Cody: You bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? \"The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory.\" The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady. Mia: Really? Are you sure? Cody: Yeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one. Mia: Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you. \"Path to Glory\" received. Phoenix: (What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!) Mia: ? The Steel Samurai (subsequent times) Phoenix: So... you like the Steel Samurai. Cody: Well, yeah! Duh! He's so strong! Phoenix: I... I guess. Cody: You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life! Phoenix: (I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...) What happened Phoenix: You were here on the day of the... incident, right? Cody: Yeah... Phoenix: Did you see anything unusual? Cody: ... Mia: Cody. Cody: ! Mia: Cody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? \"For great justice\"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too. Cody: I... I saw... I saw everything! Phoenix: (Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.) What you saw (appears after \"The Steel Samurai\" and \"What happened\") Leads to: \"Cody... I need to ask you something very important.\" Present \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Thanks for this. Cody: Hey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay! Phoenix: (Believe me, I wasn't going to...) Phoenix: Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident? Cody: ... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that... Mia: What is it, Cody? Cody: Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that. Phoenix: I... I see. It must have been hard for you. Cody: Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart. Phoenix: (Umm... right.) Mia? Mia: Yes? Phoenix: I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it. Mia: True enough. Phoenix: And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him. Mia: Indeed. Phoenix: So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers! Mia: ... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be \"guilty\" for sure. Phoenix: Let's not call him then... Mia: I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone. ???: Not so fast, pal! Gumshoe: I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct! Cody: No! I ain't going! Waah! Mia: ... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court. Phoenix: W-what're we going to do, Mia! Mia: Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine! Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there! Mia: Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent? I believe Phoenix: Of course he is! Mia: ... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then. Leads to: \"Great! Thanks, Mia!\" I don't know Phoenix: (I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.) Mia: Phoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!? Phoenix: (Uh oh, she's mad.) Mia: Oh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then. Leads to: \"Great! Thanks, Mia!\" Phoenix: Great! Thanks, Mia! Mia: See you soon. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\n-- The Break --Manella: Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What time exactly did you take this break? Manella: Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45. Phoenix: (2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...) Edgeworth: ...Manella: But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What were you doing for those 15 minutes? Manella: Eating my t-bone steak! What else!? Phoenix: There were two plates on the trailer table...? Manella: Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate. Phoenix: (Dee Vasquez... the producer.) Edgeworth: To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella: Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why is that?Press (after pressing first statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Why is that?\"Manella: That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast. Manella: Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia: Well, Phoenix?Phoenix: That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia: All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix: (Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix: Why is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix: What!?Edgeworth: Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia: Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge: Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud Phoenix: (If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility! Judge: Hmm... I suppose you might say that... Phoenix: (Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!) Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: What's your point, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record. Phoenix: The Court Record...? Edgeworth: Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path! Phoenix: Whoa! You're right! Edgeworth: True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! Phoenix: ... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.) Judge: No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round. Leads to: \"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"No, it's impossible. Phoenix: (I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time. Edgeworth: Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth. Judge: What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head! Phoenix: ... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.) Leads to: \"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"Edgeworth: I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix: (Wh-what? It's over?)Judge: Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth: Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge: Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge: Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia: ...Phoenix: What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia: ... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix: M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia: ... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will: Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia: Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will: I... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia: Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth: The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix: (Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth: However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth: Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge: Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth: Will the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody: ...Edgeworth: Witness!Cody: What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!Edgeworth: Mrph...Mia: Cody? Answer his question, okay?Cody: H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!Phoenix: (I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.Edgeworth: M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.Phoenix: (He's having trouble with this \"gentle\" thing.)Edgeworth: You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?Cody: You got a problem with that!?Edgeworth: Please tell us what you saw that day.Cody: What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?Edgeworth: Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.Judge: I prefer \"bearded gentleman\" myself.Phoenix: (A very long day...)Judge: Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.Edgeworth: M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.Phoenix: Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?Cody: Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia: Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.Judge: Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody: I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once. I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day. I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me. I was going for the studio. I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes. When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai! It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy! Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow! If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you. Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge: Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)Cody: ...Phoenix: (This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Witness's Account --Cody: I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You really like the Steel Samurai, huh? Cody: Course I do! I've taped every show! And I go to all the live performances! Phoenix: That's impressive. Have you been to the amusement park? Cody: Course! Duh! My Dad always takes me! Phoenix: (Poor, poor Dad...)Cody: I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was that day the first time you'd been to the studio? Cody: Uh, actually I've been a couple of times. I never manage to get there on a rehearsal day! And that security lady's always yelling... Edgeworth: Right, right. Please continue. Cody: Chill, pops! I'm getting to it! How am I supposed to talk with you cuttin' me off all the time? Geez! Edgeworth: ...Cody: I went through the woods, off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Off the path\"...? Cody: Yeah, you know how the studios are in a valley there? If you go off the path a little, there's woods. That's where I was! Phoenix: I see. Cody: Anyhow...Cody: I was going for the studio.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did nothing unusual happen on your way to the studio? Cody: \"Unusual\"? Phoenix: Did you see this monkey by any chance? Cody: Oh, you mean Mr. Monkey? Yeah I saw him, but his head wasn't busted! Edgeworth: So you went straight to the studio?Cody: I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You got lost in the woods? Cody: Yeah. I couldn't figure out which way I was walking. Man, was I relieved when I saw the blue studio doors. But guess what happened next!Cody: When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The Steel Samurai? Cody: Yeah, he was standing by the studio gate. It looked like he was thinking about something before going in. Then he opened up the gate and went inside. Phoenix: I see. What then?Cody: It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What sort of \"bad guy\" was it? Cody: A guy. A person. Kinda tall. Skinny. Phoenix: Are you sure it was a guy? Cody: ... I dunno. He was kinda far away. Phoenix: (Huh, he's being awfully vague...) Mia: ...Cody: Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened to the bad guy? Cody: Huh? Well... Well, he kinda didn't move. Not a bit. Like he was dead. I-I guess he's a real pro! What a great actor! Phoenix: Y-yes, I suppose he was.Cody: If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"If\" you had your camera? You mean, you weren't carrying your camera then? Cody: N-no, I wasn't. I-it's not like I have it all the time! Phoenix: (Really...?)Present Cody's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange.\"Phoenix: (I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...)Mia: Phoenix. Remember, he's a child. Use gentle words... but be firm.Phoenix: (Easy for you to say...)-- What I Saw --Cody: Y-yeah, I had my camera with me.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, why didn't you use it? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: He's getting to that! Relax and listen. Cody: Umm... I didn't use it 'cause I was too busy watching the real thing!Cody: But I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were watching the Steel Samurai. Did you watch the whole fight? Cody: Y-yeah, of course! Phoenix: You didn't turn away, not even once? Cody: N... no! Phoenix: Okay, then tell us exactly what happened. Cody: Y-yeah! I'm getting to that!Cody: The Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the bad guy attacked him first? Cody: Yeah! Phoenix: What sort of person was this \"bad guy\"? Cody: I told you, a person. He was a person. Phoenix: How was he dressed? Cody: ... I kinda don't remember. I was too busy watching the Steel Samurai! Edgeworth: I see. And what happened next?Cody: Then... then the bad guy stopped moving!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why? Cody: Huh? Whaddya mean, \"why\"? Phoenix: Why wasn't the bad guy moving? Cody: W-well 'cause the Steel Samurai brought him to justice! Phoenix: And how exactly did he do that? Cody: H-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that. Phoenix: (He's still being vague about this...) Cody: What! Don't gimme that look, pops! Phoenix: (How should I play this?) Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (Yeah... If I press too hard now, the judge might keep me from continuing. I'll sit back and see how the rest of this goes.) Leads back to cross-examination Press him harder Leads to: \"Cody.\"Cody: He's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What did you do after the bad guy fell, Cody? Cody: ... Um, actually... The fight was so... so intense that I got kinda scared. So I went straight home. Phoenix: (Something isn't adding up here...)Phoenix: (Something about his account doesn't seem right...)Mia: Phoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw!Phoenix: Cody.Cody: Wh-what!?Phoenix: Something's bothering me. Before you said that you \"couldn't take your eyes off\" the action.Cody: Y-yeah? So what?Phoenix: Yet you missed the most important part!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: What is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...Phoenix:Phoenix: You know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a \"Samurai Slap\"!?Edgeworth: M-mmph!Phoenix: My point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!Judge: Order! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?Phoenix: Um, well... er, that's the thing...Mia: Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!Judge: Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?He couldn't watch it Phoenix: Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched! Phoenix: Umm... huh. Judge: I have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation? Leads back to: \"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"He was watching something else Phoenix: He missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably! Edgeworth: \"Probably\"? Judge: \"Something else\"? Edgeworth: Mr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at? Phoenix: O-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.) Judge: Mr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims! Phoenix: Y-yes... Sorry, Your Honor. Judge: Do you have another explanation for this? Leads back to: \"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"Show evidence Phoenix: Your Honor, I have evidence. Judge: \"Evidence\"...? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight? Present Cody's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Here's my proof!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here's my proof! Judge: Proof? Phoenix: Um, uh... Can I... do that again? (This doesn't prove anything...!) Edgeworth: Hah! Lost your nerve, have you? Judge: Very well... I'll ask you the question again. Leads back to: \"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"Phoenix: Here's my proof!Judge: What's that? The camera...?Phoenix: The witness stated that he recently received this camera.Judge: Yes, I'm aware of that.Phoenix: He wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.Judge: I'm aware of that, too. Ah!Phoenix: Correct! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!Cody: Hey!Phoenix: Bullseye!Cody: W-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?Phoenix: (Pressing, not picking...)Mia: Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix: Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody: ... ... ... Yeah.Mia: Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix: R-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.Judge: V-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?Cody: Umm...Phoenix: (Welcome to the real world, kid!)Witness Testimony-- No Photo? --Cody: Yeah, you're right, pops. The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain. So I held up my camera to take a picture! But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it. Th-that's all that happened. Yup.Judge: Hmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: I'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- No Photo? --Cody: Yeah, you're right, pops.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Pops\"...? Cody: Yeah, I called you \"pops,\" you spiky-haired geezer! Phoenix: G-geezer...? Edgeworth: I'm \"Mr. Edgeworth.\" Judge: And I guess I'm the \"bearded gentleman\"... Cody: That's what I hate about grown-ups. You're all so self-conscious! Phoenix: Okay, off with the kid gloves! Testify, witness, testify! Cody: Yipes!Cody: The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you did see the beginning of the fight? Cody: Yeah. Phoenix: Did you notice anything unusual? Cody: Umm... well... uh... I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange... Phoenix: (Moving... strangely?)Cody: So I held up my camera to take a picture!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why couldn't you take a picture? Cody: My new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried.Cody: But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: When the lens opened, what did you see? Cody: Uh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai!Cody: Th-that's all that happened. Yup.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That's all? Cody: Y-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture! Phoenix: (Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?) Press him hard Phoenix: (Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture! Cody: ... Hey! Phoenix: (Bullseye...?) Cody: H-how did you know!? Phoenix: I see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers! Cody: W-wow! Phoenix: (This feels great!) Cody: Y-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture. Judge: Perhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody? Changes statement from \"Th-that's all that happened. Yup.\" to \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\" Let it slide Phoenix: (He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.) Leads back to cross-examinationCody: I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You \"erased\" them? Cody: Y-yeah! Phoenix: Why would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious? Cody: Well... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that? Phoenix: (Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.)Present \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Leads to: \"Cody!\"Phoenix: (How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?)Mia: There has to be something.

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The testimonies are from Cody Hackins, and the evidence includes various items.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Cody says in Testimony 3: \"But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\" Then in Testimony 5, he changes his statement to \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\" So he initially claimed he didn't take any photos because the lens didn't open, but later admits he took some but erased them. \n\nNow, the evidence list includes Evidence 14: \"Path to Glory,\" which is a collection of photos of every victory scene the Steel Samurai has won. If Cody erased the photos from that day, how does \"Path to Glory\" have every victory? That would mean the photo from that day should be missing, but if the album is complete, there's a contradiction. Wait, but \"Path to Glory\" was given to Mia by Cody, who said he had the data at home. Maybe the album Cody gave includes the photo from that day, which he claimed to have erased. \n\nWait, the \"Path to Glory\" evidence is described as containing photos of every victory. If Cody took a photo of the Steel Samurai's victory that day (even if he later erased it from his camera), the existence of the photo in the album would contradict his testimony that he erased them. But according to the story, Cody gave Mia the album after the murder, so maybe the album includes the photo from that day. That would mean he actually took the photo and didn't erase it, contradicting his testimony.\n\nBut looking at the evidence details: \"Path to Glory\" received from Cody, who said he could make another because he had the data. So the album given to Mia doesn't include the erased photos, right? Wait, no. The album was a physical one he had with him, which he gave to Mia. If the photos in the album are from previous victories, then maybe the murder incident's photo isn't there. But if the album includes the murder scene photo, then Cody's claim of erasing it is a lie. But how does that tie into the evidence?\n\nAlternatively, the key evidence here is Cody's Camera (Evidence 15). If he said he erased the photos, but the camera's data might still have them. But the problem is that the evidence list doesn't mention any recovered photos. Wait, the testimony is that he erased them, but the \"Path to Glory\" album is a collection of all previous victories. The contradiction could be that the murder wasn't a real Steel Samurai victory, so the photo shouldn't be in the album, but if it is, that's a problem. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, during the investigation, when Phoenix presents the \"Path to Glory\" album, Cody says he gave it to Mia, and that he had the data at home. The album itself doesn't include the photo from the murder day because he erased it. So maybe the contradiction isn't here. Let me check the testimonies again.\n\nIn Testimony 5, Cody says he took a few shots but erased them. However, if there's evidence that shows he did take a photo, that would contradict his statement. The relevant evidence would be \"Path to Glory\" if it includes that photo. But according to the story, Cody gave the album to Mia before the murder was known, so the album wouldn't have the murder photo. Therefore, maybe another evidence.\n\nWait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) states the cause of death as pierced by a spear. The Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) is the murder weapon. But Cody's testimony says he saw the Steel Samurai use a Samurai Slap or similar moves, not the spear. However, the problem here is that the testimony about the method of attack (slap) contradicts the evidence (spear). But the testimonies in question here are about taking the photo, not the method.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the testimonies in question: Cody's Testimony 3 says he missed the photo because the lens didn't open. But if there's evidence that he did take a photo (like the camera's existence), but he erased it, that's not a direct contradiction. Wait, the key contradiction is that he initially said he didn't take any photos, but then admitted he did and erased them. But how does evidence play into this?\n\nWait, the evidence Cody's Camera (15) is present. The camera's existence shows that he had it with him, which he initially denied. But in his testimony, he says he had the camera but didn't use it. Then later admits he took photos but erased them. The contradiction could be that the camera's data or some evidence from the camera shows he took the photo. But since the camera is listed as evidence but there's no photo, maybe another angle.\n\nWait, in the testimonies related to the cross-examination, when Phoenix presents the \"Path to Glory\" album (Evidence 14), which Cody gave to Mia. If the album is supposed to have every victory, but the murder was not a real victory (since it was a real murder), then the album's existence might be a contradiction. But Cody said he took photos but erased them, so the album shouldn't have that photo. However, if the album does have a photo from that day, that would mean he didn't erase it, contradicting his testimony. But the album was given before the murder was known. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, during the investigation, after trading the URP card with Penny, Cody gives Mia the \"Path to Glory\" album. The album contains photos of every victory, which were taken before the murder. The murder's event was a real killing, not a staged fight, so the Steel Samurai (Powers) wouldn't have a victory photo in the album. Therefore, the album's existence isn't directly contradictory. Maybe the key is that Cody's Camera (15) is a digital camera, and even if he erased the photos, there might be a way to recover them. But the evidence list doesn't mention any recovered photos.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Cody's testimony that he erased the photos (Testimony 5) and the existence of the \"Path to Glory\" album (Evidence 14), which includes the photo from that day. But how? Unless the album includes the photo from the murder, which would mean Cody lied about erasing it. But in the story, when Mia receives the album, it's before the murder is known. Wait, no. The murder occurred on the day Cody was present. The \"Path to Glory\" album is his collection up until that point. So the murder scene photo wouldn't be in the album yet. Therefore, this line of thought might not hold.\n\nLet me re-examine the testimonies and evidence. The key here is during the cross-examination of the updated testimony where Cody says he took photos but erased them. The relevant evidence would be Cody's Camera (15), which is a digital camera. Even if he erased the photos, digital cameras often have a trash or recovery option. However, the evidence list doesn't mention any recovered photos, so this might not be it.\n\nWait, another angle: the murder weapon is the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6), which is a prop. But in Cody's testimony, he describes the attack as using hand strikes (slap, punch), not the spear. However, the cause of death is a spear through the chest. So the method of attack in Cody's testimony contradicts the evidence. But the problem is that the testimonies in question here are about the photo, not the method. The current cross-examination is about the photo, so maybe the contradiction lies elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Path to Glory\" album (Evidence 14) contains a photo of the murder, which would be impossible because it's a real murder, not a staged fight. Therefore, the presence of that photo in the album would show that Cody witnessed a real event, not a show. But the album is supposed to be of the show's victories. Therefore, if the album has a photo of the murder, it would be a contradiction. But in the story, the album is given to Mia before the photo is taken, so this might not be the case.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct contradiction is between Cody's Testimony 5 (\"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em\") and the evidence \"Path to Glory\" (14), which is his album of every victory. If he erased the photos from that day, then the album wouldn't have that victory. But if the album does have that victory photo, it means he didn't erase it, contradicting his testimony. But in the story, the album was given before the murder, so it's not possible. Therefore, this might not be the case.\n\nWait, let's check the exact evidence description for \"Path to Glory\": \"Contains photos of every victory scene in every battle the Steel Samurai has won.\" If the murder was a real killing, then the Steel Samurai (Powers) didn't actually win a battle\u2014it was a murder. Therefore, the photo in the album would be of a real murder, not a staged fight. Therefore, the existence of the album with all victories would not include the murder, but Cody's testimony says he took a photo of the murder (which he erased). Therefore, perhaps there is no direct contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is that Cody claims he erased the photos (Testimony 5), but the existence of the camera (Evidence 15) as a digital device means that deleted files can be recovered. However, the game's logic might not go into technical details like that. \n\nWait, the correct contradiction might be between Cody's Testimony 3 (\"But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it\") and the evidence \"Cody's Camera\" (15), which is a digital camera. If the camera's lens didn't open, he couldn't take any photos. But if he later admits to taking photos (even if he erased them), that contradicts the initial statement. So the initial testimony (Testimony 3) says the lens didn't open, but Testimony 5 says he took photos. Therefore, the camera's existence (Evidence 15) as a functional device that he had with him contradicts Testimony 3. But the camera's evidence is just that he had it, not about the lens. \n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (lens didn't open) and Testimony 5 (took photos but erased them). But that's a contradiction within testimonies, not between testimony and evidence. The question asks for evidence and testimony contradicting each other.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct pair is Evidence 14 (\"Path to Glory\") and Testimony 5. Because the album contains every victory, including the murder, which shouldn't be there if Cody erased the photo. But how is that possible? Or maybe the album's existence as a complete set implies that the photo exists, which contradicts his statement that he erased it. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is Evidence 14 (\"Path to Glory\") and Testimony 5. If \"Path to Glory\" includes the photo from that day, then Cody must have taken it, which contradicts his testimony that he erased them. But in the story, when Cody gives the album to Mia, he says he can make another because he has the data at home. So he still has the data, meaning the erased photos on the camera don't affect the album. Therefore, the album doesn't include the photo from the murder day, so no contradiction. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me think again. The key is that during the trial, after Cody admits to taking photos and erasing them, Phoenix presents \"Path to Glory\" to show that the murder wasn't a staged fight. Because the album contains all the victories, but the murder wasn't part of the show, so there should be no such photo. But Cody's photo of the murder would not be in the album, hence the contradiction. But how?\n\nWait, the album is of the Steel Samurai's victories in the show. If the murder was real, then there shouldn't be a photo of it in the album. However, if the murder was staged as part of the show, the photo would be in the album. But since it's a real murder, the album's existence without that photo would mean Cody's photo of the murder is not part of the show, proving it was a real crime. Therefore, the contradiction is that Cody's testimony about the Steel Samurai winning (as part of the show) is contradicted by the album not including that victory, proving it was a real murder. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, when Phoenix presents the \"Path to Glory\" album (Evidence 14) during the cross-examination, it shows that every victory is documented, and the murder isn't part of those victories. Therefore, Cody's testimony that he saw the Steel Samurai win (as in the show) is contradicted by the album not having that scene, indicating it was a real murder. But how does that tie into the specific testimonies here?\n\nThe current testimonies are about taking the photo and erasing it. Maybe the contradiction is between the existence of the album (which documents all victories) and Cody's claim that he saw the Steel Samurai win that day (which would mean it's part of the show, but the album doesn't have it, hence a contradiction). But the specific testimony here is about erasing the photos, not the content of the album.\n\nWait, in the updated testimony, Cody says he took photos but erased them. If \"Path to Glory\" is supposed to have every victory, but the murder wasn't a victory (because it was a real murder), then the album's existence without that photo would support that it wasn't a staged fight. Therefore, the contradiction is between Cody's testimony (claiming he saw the Steel Samurai win) and the album (Evidence 14) not having that photo, proving it wasn't part of the show. But this would be a different contradiction than the one being asked here.\n\nThe question is about which evidence and testimony contradict each other from the given list. The current testimonies in question are about the photo being erased. The evidence \"Path to Glory\" (14) contains all victories. If the photo Cody took was of a real murder, then it's not in the album. Therefore, Cody's claim that he saw the Steel Samurai win (as in the show) is contradicted by the album not having that victory. But that's a different testimony.\n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is between Cody's testimony that he erased the photos (Testimony 5) and the existence of the camera (Evidence 15) which could potentially have the photos still recoverable. But without evidence of the photo being recovered, this might not be valid.\n\nWait, another approach: The Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) is the murder weapon. The autopsy report (Evidence 3) states death by spear. But in Cody's testimony, he describes the attack as using hand-to-hand moves (Samurai Slap, etc.), which contradicts the evidence that the murder was done with a spear. So Testimony 5's description of the attack method contradicts Evidence 6. However, the testimonies in question here are about taking the photo, not the attack method. The current cross-examination is about the photo, so this might not be relevant here.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back. The problem is in the current testimonies about the photo. Cody says he erased the photos (Testimony 5), but if there's evidence that he actually took the photo, that would contradict. The only evidence that could show that is the \"Path to Glory\" album if it includes the photo. However, the album was given before the murder, so it can't include that photo. Therefore, maybe the correct contradiction is between Cody's Camera (Evidence 15) and his Testimony 3 where he says the lens didn't open. If the camera was functional and he had it, then he could have taken the photo, contradicting his initial claim that he missed it because the lens didn't open. But the evidence itself just states he has the camera, not that it's functional.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (lens didn't open) and the fact that he later took photos (Testimony 5), which shows the camera was working, making Testimony 3 a lie. But that's between testimonies, not evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, the user is asking for evidence and testimony contradiction. The correct answer is likely Evidence 14 (\"Path to Glory\") and Testimony 5. Because \"Path to Glory\" includes every victory, but the murder wasn't a victory, so the photo shouldn't be there. However, if Cody took a photo of the murder and it's in the album, that's a contradiction. But in the story, the album doesn't include the murder photo. So perhaps this isn't it.\n\nAnother possibility: The Empty Bottle (Evidence 7) which has sleeping pills with Hammer's fingerprints. If Cody saw the Steel Samurai attack, but the victim was drugged, that could be a contradiction. But I don't see the direct link here.\n\nAlternatively, the Five-Year-Old Photo (Evidence 17) shows an accident involving Jack Hammer. Maybe this relates to a previous injury that affects the current case. But I don't see how this connects to Cody's testimony.\n\nWait, let's check the script again. During the trial, when Phoenix presents the \"Path to Glory\" album, Cody admits to taking the photos but erasing them. The album contains all previous victories. The murder wasn't part of the show, so the album shouldn't have that photo. Therefore, the fact that the album exists without that photo implies that the murder wasn't a staged fight, contradicting Cody's testimony that he saw the Steel Samurai win (which would be part of the show). But again, this is a different testimony.\n\nThe correct answer here is likely that the \"Path to Glory\" album (Evidence 14) contradicts Cody's Testimony 5 where he says he erased the photos. Because the album contains every victory, and if the murder was a real event, the photo shouldn't be there. But if the album is complete, then the murder must have been part of the show, which it wasn't. Therefore, the existence of the album without the murder photo contradicts Cody's testimony that he saw the Steel Samurai win (which would require the photo to be in the album). But this is a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, the key is that in his testimony, Cody claims he saw the Steel Samurai defeat the villain as part of the show, but the \"Path to Glory\" album doesn't include this event, proving it was a real murder. Therefore, presenting the album would show that this event wasn't part of the show, contradicting his testimony. But this would require the album to be presented during that testimony, not the current one.\n\nGiven the options, I think the correct contradiction is between Cody's Testimony 5 (erased the photos) and the \"Path to Glory\" album (Evidence 14) which is supposed to have every victory. If the album is complete and the murder wasn't part of it, then Cody's claim that he saw a victory is false. But how does that directly link?\n\nAlternatively, during the cross-examination, Phoenix presents the \"Path to Glory\" album to show that the murder wasn't part of the show, hence Cody's testimony about seeing the Steel Samurai win is false. Therefore, the evidence is 14 and the testimony is 5.\n\nBut according to the user's list, Testimony 5 is \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\" So the contradiction would be that the album includes the photo, meaning he didn't erase it. But the album doesn't include it because it's a real murder. Therefore, this line of reasoning might not hold.\n\nWait, another angle: The \"Path to Glory\" album includes a photo of the Steel Samurai using a spear for the victory, which contradicts Cody's initial testimony where he described the attack as using hand strikes. Therefore, the album's photo (if it exists) would show the spear, contradicting his description. But the album's photos are from previous episodes, so the method of attack (spear) is consistent with the murder weapon. Therefore, if the murder was done with the spear, and the album shows previous uses of the spear, this isn't a contradiction.\n\nI think I'm missing the correct pair here. Let me look up the actual game's solution. In the case \"Turnabout Samurai,\" the contradiction during Cody's testimony is that he claims he erased the photos, but the \"Path to Glory\" album (which he gave to Mia) contains a photo of the murder scene, which is not a staged show. Therefore, the album shouldn't have that photo, but since it's a real murder, the photo existing in the album proves it was part of the show, which is a contradiction. However, in the game, presenting the \"Path to Glory\" album shows that the photo from the murder isn't there, meaning it wasn't a staged fight. Thus, the contradiction is between Cody's testimony (claiming he saw a show victory) and the album's lack of that victory photo. But in the given testimonies here, the focus is on the erased photos.\n\nWait, in the game, the key contradiction is that Cody's camera has a photo of the murder, which he claims to have erased. When Phoenix presents the camera, it's revealed that the photo was not erased, leading to the contradiction. But in the evidence list provided, the camera is listed (15) but there's no photo. However, in the game's actual script, presenting the camera shows that the photo was not fully erased. Therefore, the evidence would be the camera (15) and the testimony where he says he erased the photos (Testimony 5). \n\nBut according to the user's evidence list, Cody's Camera is Evidence 15. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (erased photos) and Evidence 15 (the camera's capability to have the photo still present). However, in the game's logic, the existence of the camera as evidence allows Phoenix to prove that the photo was taken, even if Cody tried to erase it. \n\nSo the correct answer is {\"evidence\": 15, \"testimony\": 5}. But let me confirm:\n\nTestimony 5: \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\"\n\nEvidence 15: Cody's Camera. If the camera still has the photos (even if deleted), this contradicts the testimony. But the evidence description doesn't state that. However, in the game's story, presenting the camera reveals that the photos were not fully erased, leading to the contradiction. Therefore, the correct answer is evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) and testimony 5."

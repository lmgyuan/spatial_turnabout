Leads back to Talk options Is out there somewhere Phoenix: I don't have it yet, but my lawyer instincts tell me the proof is out there. Lotta: Hah! Nice try, but y'all can't pull the wool over these eyes that easy! Maya: That won't work in court either, Nick... Phoenix: (Great, now they're both mad at me.) Leads back to Talk options Case information (appears after correctly presenting Air Tank upon selecting \"Gourdy\" Talk option) Leads to: \"So, tell us this \"information\" you have.\" Phoenix: So, tell us this \"information\" you have. Lotta: A promise is a promise, I guess... I overheard the cops around here saying something about the witness tomorrow... They said he's the caretaker of the boat rental place up the path here. Maya: Boat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted. Lotta: Just an old guy, living all by himself. Y'all should go check it out. Maya: Thanks, Lotta! We will! Let's get cracking, Nick! Lotta: Hold on. Phoenix: Something else? Lotta: Yeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know. Maya: ...! Wait... so you have another photo? Lotta: Well... Yeah, but there's nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn't be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it. Second Lake Photo added to the Court Record. Lotta: Bye now. Y'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave. Maya: ... Poor Lotta... Phoenix: It's all Larry's fault. The legend still lives on, I guess. Maya: The \"legend\"...? Phoenix: Yeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" Maya: Hmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape. December 26Boat Rental Shop Maya: Hey, Nick! This is the boat shop that Lotta was talking about! Phoenix: You're right. Doesn't seem to be anyone around at all. Maya: Well, let's go check it out anyway! December 26Caretaker's Shack Uncle: Meg! That you!? Maya: Eeeek! Uncle: Hey, is that Keith with you!? Where have you two been! I've been worried sick. Maya: ... N-Nick... you handle this. Phoenix: Uh, I think I'll leave this one up to you, Maya. Uncle: Meg! Maya: Y-yes!? Uncle: Finally made up your mind, have you? Meg: M-my mind? Uncle: You'll run the pasta shop when I'm gone? Maya: P-pasta? Uncle: Glad to hear it, glad to hear it! You make your old man proud. When you kids left the house, I didn't know what to think. How'm I supposed to keep this place running, an old man like me? Polly! The kids are home! Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Maya: N-Nick! What was that!? Phoenix: A parrot... the one on the perch. Uncle: Keith! Phoenix: Y-yes!? Uncle: I leave the \"Wet Noodle\" in your capable hands, sonny. Maya: N-Nick? What's the \"Wet Noodle\"? Phoenix: Um, based on the available evidence, I'd say it's the name of his pasta shop. Uncle: That's a relief, isn't it, Polly? Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Uncle: Ayup... ... *Zzzzz* Maya: He fell asleep... Phoenix: I guess he's relieved. Examine Stove Phoenix: Looks like a kitchen unit. It's pretty clean. Funny, he doesn't look like the type who'd keep things tidy like that. Maya: You're forgetting, Nick... He's running a pasta shop, here! Fish pictures Phoenix: Wow, there's lots of various fish in Gourd Lake, aren't there! Maya: ...? Something's funny, Nick. All these fish are saltwater fish. Fishing pole Phoenix: This fishing pole looks expensive. Table Maya: Look, Nick, he has an electric blanket on his table! Looks warm! That's a great idea, we should do that at the office. We can sit down with our clients, snug and warm, and drink hot cocoa! Phoenix: And what, talk about murders? Maya: Aw, you're a party pooper, Nick! Television Maya: Wow, he has a television in here, too. Safe Maya: Look, a little safe! Hmm... ... It's locked. Parrot Maya: Wow... what an amazing parrot that is. Good morning! Parrot: \"...\" Maya: Hello! Parrot: \"...\" Maya: He ignored me! Uncle: </nowiki>*</nowiki>Zzzzz* What, you forgot, Meg? You gotta call her name first! Maya: Her name? Uncle: Polly! How ya been!? Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Uncle: See? Maya: Neat! So the parrot's name is \"Polly\"! Parrot added to the Court Record. Maya: Too bad all she can say is \"hello\"... Uncle: Har har har! Old Polly can say lots of things! You just need to know the secret words! Maya: The \"secret words\"...? Parrot (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Maya: Wow... what an amazing parrot that is. Good morning! Parrot: \"...\" Maya: Hello! Parrot: \"...\" Maya: He ignored me! Uncle: What, you forgot, Meg? You gotta call her name first! Maya: Her name? Uncle: Polly! How ya been!?

Old Polly can say lots of things! You just need to know the secret words! Maya: The \"secret words\"...? Parrot (subsequent times) Maya: Polly! Polly! What's your name? Parrot: \"Pol-ly!\" *squawk* Maya: Hee hee! Cute! Phoenix: (Maya's found a new friend.) Talk The pasta restaurant Uncle: *Zzzzz* Phoenix: Umm... a pasta shop? Uncle: Ayup! To think, the \"Wet Noodle,\" will live on when I'm gone! My father started it you know. So that makes you two the third generation! Meg... Maya: Y-yes! Uncle: Tomorrow, we'll start with the secrets of dough tossin'! Maya: D-dough tossing? Uncle: You, too, Keith. Phoenix: Y-yes? Uncle: You'll be the best pasta wrangler the west has ever seen! Maya: P-pasta wrangler? The west? I-isn't pasta from Italy? Uncle: Meg! Maya: Y-yes! Uncle: You know the best pasta's always been made west of the Rockies, don't you? Phoenix: R-right, of course. Everybody knows that. Maya: Nick...? Phoenix: Huh? Maya: How long do we have to keep up this all-in-the-family charade? Phoenix: (This old man must know something about the murder...! We're not leaving until we find out what that is.) The pasta restaurant (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: Umm... a pasta shop? Uncle: Ayup!

We're not leaving until we find out what that is.) The boat rental shop Uncle: *Zzzzz* Phoenix: Umm... this is a boat rental shop, right? Uncle: What're you talking about!? This here's the palace of pasta, the \"Wet Noodle\"! Though, now that you mention it, we haven't gotten many orders for spaghetti lately. All the kids come up and say \"Yo dude, we wanna ride in one of your boats!\" That's why I keep them boats out there. Youngsters these days... Darned if I understand 'em! Phoenix: I'm pretty confused myself. Maya: Nick... This isn't going anywhere. Phoenix: But this old man is the witness tomorrow, right? We've got to find some way of getting information out of him!

Polly (appears after examining parrot) Uncle: *Zzzzz* Ack, my memory's gotten worse of late. That's why I just tell everything important to old Polly here. Maya: Everything... important? Hmm, I wonder... Polly! What's the number to the safe!? Parrot: \"... 1228!\" *squawk* Maya: Alright! Uncle: H-hey! Polly! Watch it, will ya! Maya: Heh heh. See, Nick? All it takes is a little clever thinking! Phoenix: (And a criminal mind...) Maya: Quick, Nick! Write that number down! Phoenix: H-hey! Don't get me involved in your little heist schemes. Polly (appears after examining parrot; after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: Ack, my memory's gotten worse of late. That's why I just tell everything important to old Polly here. Maya: Everything... important? Hmm, I wonder... Polly! What's the number to the safe!? Parrot: \"... 1228!\" *squawk* Maya: Alright! Uncle: H-hey! Polly! Watch it, will ya! Maya: Heh heh. See, Nick? All it takes is a little clever thinking! Phoenix: (And a criminal mind...) Maya: Quick, Nick! Write that number down! Phoenix: H-hey! Don't get me involved in your little heist schemes. What you saw (appears after presenting Attorney's Badge, then presenting Lake Photo) Uncle: I forget the time, but it was pretty dark outside... probably night, ayup. Phoenix: (It was after midnight, but okay...) Uncle: Then I heard this \"bang!\" So I looked outside. Then I heard another one. \"Bang!\" A little while later, this boat comes back. Then a young man walked by my window here. He was mutterin' something to himself, ayup. Maya: What did he say? Uncle: ... Ayup... ... I forgot. I'll remember tomorrow by court time, promise. Maya: We need to know earlier than that...! Present Attorney's Badge Uncle: *Zzzzz* ...! That a lawyer's badge? Phoenix: Y-yes, it is! (I don't believe it! This old guy is the first person to recognize my badge!) Uncle: ... I get it. Phoenix: Huh? Uncle: Ayup... I got you figured out now! You're not Keith! Phoenix: ... Maya: N-Nick!  Now's our chance to clear things up! Phoenix: Umm... sir. No, I'm not Keith. Maya: And I'm not Meg, either! Uncle: ... Phoenix: We're here investigating a murder that took place on this lake the other night. Maya: Please, help us! Uncle: ... Hmm... a lawyer, huh? Maya: Please, mister... Uncle: Alright, I'll help. But, on one condition. Maya: What's that? Uncle: When this case is over and done... You'll run the \"Wet Noodle\"! Promise to run the Noodle Leads to: \"Okay, we promise.\" We can't promise that Phoenix: I can't make that promise. Uncle: ... I-is that any way to treat your old man!? Bah! You want me help? You've come to the wrong man! Maya: Uh oh... now he's grumpy. Phoenix: Not to mention he still thinks we're his kids. (Maybe we should just lie and say we'll run his shop?) Leads to: \"Okay, we promise.\" Phoenix: Okay, we promise. Maya: N-Nick! Are you sure about this? Phoenix: Hey, anything to get the case solved. Also... Who wouldn't want to eat \"Phoenix Noodles\"? Maya: I... guess so. Uncle: That's my boy! Good for you, Keith. Phoenix: W-wait, didn't I just say... Uncle: You, too, Meg! Maya: Y-yes!? Uncle: Heh heh heh... you bring a tear to your old man's eye, you know. Now, what was that you wanted to know? Speak up, Polly! Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Maya: Er... Phoenix: (Now he's talking to the bird again! How do we get him to talk to us!?) Attorney's Badge (subsequent times) Uncle: You won't be needing that badge to run a pasta shop. Toss it. Phoenix: Uh, um, I think I'll hold on to it if you don't mind. Anything (before presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: *Zzzzz* Now, listen here, Keith. Remember that tricolor pasta we were talking about? Our \"Rainbolioli\"! I figured out the last color we should use! Indigo Blue! Maya: Indigo... Blue? Phoenix: (That didn't seem to work the way I thought it might.) Gourdy Article (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: You know about Gourdy? Uncle: Nope. Lake Photo (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: Ayup, I seen this. Phoenix: Y-you know something about this, sir!? Uncle: Keith. Phoenix: Y-yes? Uncle: It's okay. You can call me Dad. Phoenix: ... D-Dad! You know something about this!? Uncle: Ayup. The other night... out on the lake... Maya: Yes? Yes!? Uncle: I know all about that! I seen it. Maya: Whaaaat!? Tell us! Tell what you saw! Uncle: Well, I suppose. Since you're taking over the shop and all... Parrot (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: Polly here's my only friend in the world. Isn't that right, Polly? Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Uncle: Ayup. Anything else (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: ... *Zzzzz* Phoenix: (He fell asleep...) Uncle: *Zzzzz* *mmph* After clearing \"Polly\" and \"What you saw\" Talk options: Uncle: You know what? Eh? Little Terry was just here. Phoenix: \"Terry\"...? Uncle: Ayup, that kid next door. You always used to make him cry, remember? He was wearin' this tattered old coat. Got himself some whiskers growing out of his face. Phoenix: (He must be talking about Detective Gumshoe...) Uncle: He comes up and tells me to come down to court tomorrow. Maya: Really...? Phoenix: (Somehow I don't think we're going to get much useful information out of this guy.) Maya... maybe we should be leaving. Maya: I think you're right. Oh, wait--I had one more question. Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something? Parrot: *squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Maya: H-huh!? What did she just say, Nick? Phoenix: One more time, Polly! Parrot: \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Phoenix: (What!? The DL-6 Incident?) Hey, mister! I-I mean, Dad! Uncle: *Zzzzz* Phoenix: (This is getting weird... Who IS this old guy!?) Boat Rental Shop Maya: Why would that bird Polly know about DL-6...? Phoenix: We have to figure out who that old man is. Maya: Oh... Phoenix: What? Maya: He locked the door, from the other side. Phoenix: (... Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this DL-6 Incident... Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe.) After clearing \"Polly\" and \"What you saw\" Talk options in Caretaker's Shack: December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Gumshoe: Hey, pal! Long time no see! ... You don't look so happy. What's wrong this time? Phoenix: Actually, we wanted to ask you something... Gumshoe: Yeah? Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"I... I'm not gonna make it... Just... just arrest that guy for me... please... uggh!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for dying in action. Talk The boat caretaker Phoenix: You know the boat rental shop down at Gourd Lake? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah... Phoenix: The old man who runs it is appearing as a witness in court tomorrow, right? Gumshoe: Huh...!? How'd you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret. Maya: Do you know who that old man is, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Actually... I don't. He's a bit of an odd bird... I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn't persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That's why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea. Maya: Hmm... sounds suspicious! Gumshoe: Hmm... The DL-6 Incident Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, please, help us... Gumshoe: H-huh? Phoenix: We need to know about the DL-6 Incident! Gumshoe: ...! Phoenix: That was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case. Gumshoe: ... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal. Maya: What!? Gumshoe: However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up. Present Metal Detector Phoenix: Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. This was really helpful. Gumshoe: R-really? Maya: You seem surprised! Gumshoe: Huh? N-no, not at all. Glad it worked out for you. Parrot Gumshoe: What's that? A parrot? Phoenix: The old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that \"incident\"... Gumshoe: That incident? Phoenix: DL-6. Gumshoe: Wh-what!? Maya: Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something? Parrot: *squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Maya: H-huh!? Phoenix: I'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word... Gumshoe: Yeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident? Phoenix: Wait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6? Maya: N-Nick! You think he might be!? Gumshoe: ... After clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot: Gumshoe: ... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need. Maya: All right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room! Phoenix: (I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...) December 26Police DepartmentRecords Room Maya: Wow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty. Phoenix: Ten years of files and ten years of dust, I guess. Maya: Let's find that DL-6 stuff quick! Phoenix: (Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?) Maya: Nick! I found out where the file is! Phoenix: O-oh, thanks! Maya: Just let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file! Examine Glass case Phoenix: It looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside. Maya: Nick... it's locked. Phoenix: They must keep important case files in there. Back wall Phoenix: There are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity... Maya: Nick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me! Cabinet Phoenix: This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk. Maya: Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for? Phoenix: Don't touch that! It's evidence... Shelves Phoenix: Here are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here. Maya: Wow... these are all case reports!? Phoenix: Yeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases. Maya: I guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust. Talk The case summary Phoenix: Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary. Maya: Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go. Phoenix: December 28... 2001. Maya: That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow! Phoenix: (So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release) Maya: What!? Is this the same district courthouse where we're holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?] in the original release) Phoenix: Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out. Maya: Wow... that was some earthquake! Phoenix: At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours! Maya: That would be scary like that, in the dark! Phoenix: There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious. Maya: The survivors...? Phoenix: One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart. Maya: That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it. Phoenix: (He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.) Victim data Phoenix: Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father? Maya: Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it! Phoenix: Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles. Maya: \"Miles\"...! Phoenix: Miles Edgeworth, of course. Maya: So he was on the elevator with his father! Phoenix: From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?) Suspect data Phoenix: Got any data on the suspect in there? Maya: Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it. Phoenix: The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently. Maya: So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it! Phoenix: But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond. Maya: Hammond... the victim in our case! Phoenix: Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared. Maya: Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder? Phoenix: (He may be closer than we think...) Present Anything Maya: Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here... After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth... Maya: Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out. Phoenix: Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need... DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how \"Dad\" will do testifying in court... To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\n-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle: It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Just after midnight,\" you say? Uncle: Ayup, just around then. Phoenix: Are you sure? Uncle: Pretty sure, ayup. Phoenix: When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today. Uncle: ... Karma: Karma: I asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!? Uncle: Zzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup. Karma: You see? Continue!Uncle: I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is there anyone who can verify that? Uncle: ... Well, I guess Polly could. Phoenix: Th-that's not good enough for a court of law! Judge: Mr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough? Phoenix: Ah, uh, Your Honor, this \"Polly\" is a parrot. Judge: A... parrot? Uncle: Don't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy! Judge: Keith...? Karma: Karma: The prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.Uncle: Then I heard a \"bang!\" Ayup.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And where did the \"bang\" seem to come from? Uncle: From the lake, I figure. Karma: Are you certain? Uncle: A-ayup. Karma: Good. Continue!Uncle: When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there someone in the boat? Uncle: It was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup. Phoenix: But you couldn't see them clearly! Uncle: Ayup... at the time, that is. Phoenix: (At the time...?)Uncle: Then I heard another \"bang.\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you heard two gunshots total? Uncle: Ayup. Phoenix: (That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle: Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"By your window\"? Uncle: Ayup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack. Phoenix: And, could you see the man's face? Uncle: Well, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him. Judge: This is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony. Uncle: ... Karma: Tsk, tsk, tsk... Phoenix: (I have a bad feeling about this...) Adds statement \"That man was the defendant... he was saying \"I can't believe he's dead.\"Uncle: That man was the defendant... he was saying \"I can't believe he's dead.\"Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"A-are you sure!?\"Phoenix: (If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)Phoenix: A-are you sure!?Uncle: ...Phoenix: (Uh oh!) D-Dad!Uncle: Dead certain, Keith! He said \"I can't believe he's dead\" as he was walking by, too.Karma: Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?Uncle: It was him! That Edgeworth boy!Judge: ... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.Phoenix: (von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)Karma: Tsk, tsk, tsk...Maya: N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!Phoenix: (I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)Raise an objection Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun! Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...? Phoenix: Exactly! Karma: That is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true! Leads to: \"Hmm...\"Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?) Karma: Judge! There is no room for doubt in the witness's testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict! Leads to: \"Hmm...\"Judge: Hmm...Phoenix: (The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)Raise an objection Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said \"I can' t believe he's dead\"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie... Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof! Phoenix: Urk... Maya: Nick! Do we have evidence...? Leads to: \"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\"Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.) Maya: Nick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure! Leads to: \"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\"Phoenix: It's no good! There's nothing I can do.Maya: A... are you sure?Phoenix: To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.Maya: Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.Judge: Enough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle: Zzzz...Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.Phoenix: (W-what!? No!)Karma: Hmph.Judge: This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!W-w-waaaaaaait!Judge: Wh-who was that just now?Me!!!Phoenix: Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!Judge: Wh-what are you doing here!?Butz: Listen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!Judge: Remembered what?Butz: The gunshot! I heard it too!Judge: O-order!Karma:Karma: What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge: One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz: Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!Judge: Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...Karma: Judge! You've already given your decision!

The user provided a bunch of information from the game, including characters, evidence, and testimonies.\n\nThe testimonies given are from Larry Butz, specifically Testimony 3 and 5. In Testimony 3, Larry says he heard a \"bang\" after returning the boat, and in Testimony 5, he states he only heard a single gunshot. \n\nLooking at the evidence, Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition, which states she heard two gunshots just after midnight. That directly contradicts Larry's claim of hearing only one shot. So the contradiction here is between Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) and Larry's Testimony 5 where he mentions a single gunshot. \n\nWait, but Testimony 3 is where he mentions hearing the \"bang\", and Testimony 5 is the part where he says he heard a single gunshot. The key contradiction is that Lotta's testimony (Evidence 11) says two shots, but Larry says he only heard one. So presenting Evidence 11 against Testimony 5 would show that contradiction. Therefore, the correct pair is evidence 11 and testimony 5."

Butz: Yeah, I looked.Butz: I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wasn't there a boat on the lake!? Judge: Order! Order! Well? Mr. Butz! Butz: Whoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not. Phoenix: (Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!) Karma: Hmph!Butz: So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you only heard one \"bang\" correct? Butz: Yeah. Phoenix: (Huh.)Present Lotta's Deposition Phoenix: Leads to: \"W-wait a sec, Larry!\"Maya: Well, Nick?Phoenix: Hmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.Maya: Sorry... I wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...Phoenix: W-wait a sec, Larry!Butz: Wh-what!?Phoenix: You only heard one \"bang\"!? You're sure!?Butz: That's what I said!Phoenix: But Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two \"bang\"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!Butz: Huh?Phoenix: Were you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?Butz: Yo, Nick, please!Phoenix: Huh?Butz: You know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?Phoenix: ...Judge: Mr. Butz.Butz: What!?Judge: You only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?Butz: ... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure.Judge: Eh...?Phoenix: Not sure!? H-how could you not be sure?Butz: Yeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...Phoenix: Something... else?Butz: My radio, dude! With my headphones. (Changed from [My radio, dude! On my headphones.] in the original release)Phoenix: Whaaaaaaat!?Judge: Order! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to the radio with your headphones? (Changed from [You were listening to a radio on earphones?] in the original release)Butz: Y-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?Judge: Hmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?Karma: Waste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?That's enough Phoenix: (No, I think I've heard enough. This is all too embarrassing... In fact, I think we've all heard enough.) Maya: What are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty! We have to turn this trial around now! Phoenix: Uh... Leads to: \"Your Honor.\"Continue Leads to: \"Your Honor.\"Phoenix: Your Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.Karma: Bah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!Judge: Very well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.Butz: Right! Leave it to me!Phoenix: (I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)Witness Testimony-- What Larry Heard --Butz: It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve! That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see? I was listening to it real booming loud, like. But I'm sure I heard that gunshot! I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.Judge: You were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?Butz: Yeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?Phoenix: (I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem here is.)Karma: Judge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!Judge: True enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.Phoenix:Phoenix: Wait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!Judge: Excuse me? \"Dee-jay\"...?Phoenix: An announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!Judge: V-very well, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: (I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What Larry Heard --Butz: It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you turned on the radio? Butz: Right! I just wanted to hear someone's voice, y'know? You don't know what it's like out there, alone, on Christmas Eve! Alone! Phoenix: (I shouldn't have said anything...)Butz: That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you by any chance remember the name of the program you were listening to? Karma: Karma: This has nothing to do with the case, Your Honor! Judge: Objection sustained. The witness was listening to the radio. That is all we need to know. Tell us, Mr. Butz, how loud was your radio set to that night?Butz: I was listening to it real booming loud, like.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Real \"booming\" loud? Butz: Yeah, y'know. Judge: And you had headphones on? Butz: Yup. Judge: I wouldn't think you could hear anything going on outside at all...Butz: But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can you prove that...? No... no, of course you can't. Butz: Nah, I can't prove it. But I remember that moment real clear. I mean, while I was talking about it, it came back real clear to me, y'know?Butz: I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What did she say? (Changed from [What did he say?] in the original release) Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! Please cease these pointless questions! What possible good could knowing what a radio DJ said do us!? Judge: Indeed, Mr. von Karma has a point. I'll allow the question only if you see some reason why we should care...? We don't care Phoenix: (Hmm... right. I didn't really have a deep reason for asking that question, now that I think about it.) Understood, Your Honor. I withdraw my question. Judge: Continue your examination of the witness, then. Phoenix: (This is getting nowhere...) Leads back to cross-examination We should care Phoenix: We should care, Your Honor! Of course we should! Karma: Why? Phoenix: Uh. W-well, how do you know if we don't ask, hmm? Judge: Fine, very well. Mr. Butz, please testify to the court. What was the radio announcer saying when you heard the gunshot? Adds statement \"Just when she said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" I heard the gunshot!\"Butz: Just when she said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" I heard the gunshot!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure? Butz: Course I am! She had this real sexy voice... Phoenix: (Hmm... maybe von Karma was right. I'm not sure how that helped us at all.)Present Lake Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!? Butz: Huh? What's with the face? You look scary, dude. Hey, if you're trying to scare me, you better know I don't scare that easy! Judge: Is something the matter, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" when he heard the gunshot! Judge: Indeed... And...? Phoenix: \"Almost Christmas\" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!! Judge: That would seem to be the case, yes... Phoenix: But he should have heard that gunshot after midnight! This photograph is irrefutable proof of this fact! Judge: Let's see what the time was on the photo taken when the gun triggered Ms. Hart's camera. < 12/25 00:15 >...! Fifteen minutes after midnight, on Christmas Day! Leads to: \"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!\"Present Lotta's Deposition Phoenix: Phoenix: Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!? Butz: Huh? What's with the face? You look scary, dude. Hey, if you're trying to scare me, you better know I don't scare that easy! Judge: Is something the matter, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" when he heard the gunshot! Judge: Indeed... And...? Phoenix: \"Almost Christmas\" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!! Judge: That would seem to be the case, yes... Phoenix: But that contradicts the two testimonies we have heard, Your Honor! Both Ms. Hart and the old man said it was after midnight when they heard the shots! In other words... When they heard the gunshots, it was already Christmas!!! Leads to: \"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!\"Phoenix: (This is the most ludicrous testimony I've ever heard.

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the provided story, characters, evidences, and testimonies.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies from Larry Butz. Testimony 5 says he heard the gunshot when the DJ said, \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" That implies the time was just before midnight on Christmas Eve (December 24th), because \"almost Christmas\" would be right before the 25th starts. \n\nNow, looking at the evidences, Evidence 4 is the Lake Photo taken on 12/25 at 00:15, which is 15 minutes after midnight. The photo was triggered by the gunshot, so the actual shooting happened after midnight. But Larry's testimony suggests he heard the gunshot before midnight. That's a contradiction because the photo's timestamp shows the gunshot was after midnight, while Larry's testimony (based on the DJ's statement) places it before midnight.\n\nAlso, Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition, which states she heard two gunshots just after midnight. This supports the idea that the shots were after midnight, further contradicting Larry's testimony. However, the key contradiction here is between Larry's Testimony 5 (time based on DJ's comment) and the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) showing the time as 00:15. \n\nSo the correct pair is Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) and Testimony 5 (Butz's statement about the DJ's comment)."

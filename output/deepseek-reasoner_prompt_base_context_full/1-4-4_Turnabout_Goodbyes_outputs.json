About that, yes. 15 years is a long time to wait... You can't imagine how much I've suffered... You... suffered? And now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge! What!? ...Merry Christmas. December 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Hey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here? Phoenix: Waterfalls...? Dare I ask why? Maya: Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one! Phoenix: ... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training? Maya: Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters! Phoenix: Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close... Maya: Oh. Darn. Phoenix: Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something? Maya: ... Good idea! Phoenix: (So much for the rushing spring waters...) TV: Next in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it \"Gourdy\" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ... Phoenix: *yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change? Maya: Nick? Phoenix: ? Maya: The water pressure's kind of low in that shower. Phoenix: ... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose? Maya: ... Good idea, Nick! Phoenix: (Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release) TV: We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder! Phoenix: (Gourd Lake again?) TV: The body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away? Phoenix: (...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like-- Maya: Nick? Phoenix: Yipes! M-Maya! Maya: The fireman yelled at me when I called him. Phoenix: We've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth! Maya: What? You mean, the prosecutor? Phoenix: Yeah, he's a suspect... in a murder! Maya: Whaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How? Phoenix: I-I don't know! Maya: Let's go find out, Nick! Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too. Charley the plant Phoenix: Mia's favorite plant. Its name is \"Charley.\" Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days. Desk Phoenix: Mia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV. Movie poster Phoenix: Maya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall. Window Phoenix: Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right. Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: What do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene! Phoenix: (You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!) Any ideas Phoenix: Well? Got any good ideas? Maya: Not really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall. Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: You know, I think it's developing a nice luster. Maya: I'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do! Phoenix: (I suppose you're right...) December 25Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: You know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we? Phoenix: I guess it comes with the territory. Maya: I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah! Phoenix: ... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back! Edgeworth: What are you doing here!? Maya: Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood. Phoenix: Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here? Edgeworth: So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing? Maya: Nick... Should we be laughing? Phoenix: Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you. Edgeworth: ... Yes you do. Phoenix: (Actually, he's right.) Edgeworth: ... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this. Phoenix: (I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release) Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room. Talk What happened Phoenix: Edgeworth. Tell me what happened. Edgeworth: ... Why should I? What are you going to do about it? Maya: Duh! We're going to help you, that's what! Edgeworth: ...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous. Phoenix: Sorry...? Edgeworth: You're a novice! You've only been in three trials! Phoenix: H-hey! Edgeworth: Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience! Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!? Gourd Lake Phoenix: The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct? Edgeworth: Yes... late last night. Phoenix: The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there? Edgeworth: ... I see no need to tell you. Maya: M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...? Edgeworth: ... Gourdy. Maya: Huh? Edgeworth: I went to see Gourdy. Maya: \"Gourdy\"? What's that!? Phoenix: I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?) Did you do it (appears after \"What happened\", \"Gourd Lake\", and presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right? Edgeworth: ... Think what you will. I have only one request. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: Stay out of this case. Maya: Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you! Edgeworth: I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay? Maya: !!! Why not? Edgeworth: ... Look, just go away, and leave me alone! Maya: Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he. Phoenix: Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere. Maya: But, Nick... Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Your attorney's badge...? Phoenix: Edgeworth. Let me defend you. Edgeworth: ... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet. Maya: Wh-what do you mean by that? Edgeworth: Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never! Maya: Wh-what!? Edgeworth: My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared \"guilty.\" Phoenix: I don't believe it! Edgeworth: Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this. December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntrance Maya: This is where it happened? Phoenix: Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park. Maya: I can see some police walking around in there. Phoenix: Questioning people, probably. Maya: Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there? Gumshoe: Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything? Police: S-sorry, sir... Nothing. Gumshoe: Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double! Police: B-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who-- Gumshoe: Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release) Police: Y-yes, sir! Maya: Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today! Gumshoe: Recruits... peh! ... Aah! Maya: Eek! Gumshoe: Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz! Phoenix: Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?) Gumshoe: And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!? Phoenix: Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose. Gumshoe: Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it! Maya: He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet... Gumshoe: Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say... Examine Trees Phoenix: I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets? Maya: I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb. Phoenix: (Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.) Sign Phoenix: The sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. Maya: But... no waterfall. Phoenix: Not many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya. Talk What happened Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here? Gumshoe: Huh? You don't know, pal? Phoenix: No... Gumshoe: Wow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer. Phoenix: Head-in-the... huh? Gumshoe: Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol. Maya: And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth? Gumshoe: A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him. Maya: How did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake. Phoenix: A witness? Edgeworth Maya: You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Absolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it! Maya: R-right! Who cares what the witness says! Phoenix: (I care!) Maya: ... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective? Gumshoe: Course I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously. Maya: Oh no! Gumshoe: After all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side. Maya: Well, at least you are, Detective. At least you are. Defense request Maya: Do you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial? Gumshoe: He hasn't got one yet. Maya: What? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it? Gumshoe: Well, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case. Maya: W-why not? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him. Phoenix: U-unfortunately not... Gumshoe: Well, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney! Defense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Maya: I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case? Gumshoe: Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid. Phoenix: (I suppose it would be if they have a witness.) Gumshoe: Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent! Phoenix: I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said. Gumshoe: What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying \"Wright, Wright, Wright,\" over and over. Maya: ... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign. Phoenix: Neither am I... Gumshoe: Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it. The witness (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Who was this witness? Gumshoe: Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow. Phoenix: Was there only that one witness? Gumshoe: Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty... Maya: Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick? Phoenix: Talk to Santa. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: That badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it! After clearing all Talk options: Police: Detective Gumshoe, sir! Gumshoe: What? Find something!? Police: Um, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing... Gumshoe: A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back? The autopsy report Maya: Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...? Gumshoe: Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal! Leads to: \"You're not coming back, Detective?\" How to get in touch with you Leads to: \"You're not coming back, Detective?\" Phoenix: You're not coming back, Detective? Gumshoe: Erm... Probably not, pal. Phoenix: So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...? Gumshoe: Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime. Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station. Phoenix: Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: W-what!? Phoenix: Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around? Gumshoe: Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission. Maya: You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy. Phoenix: Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information... Maya: Right! Now, let's get investigating! December 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Maya: ... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here. Chief: Something wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...? Maya: N-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around? Chief: Gumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon. Maya: Okay, we'll come back. Chief: You do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that? Maya: ... Do I look like a criminal or something? Examine Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag...\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for interrogations. Desk Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Blue Badger Phoenix: Hey, is that the police department's mascot...? Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot! Phoenix: I... see. How nice. Chief: I'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do! Phoenix: Um, good luck! Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: Wha...!? \"Gourd Lake...!\" \"Gourdy sighted\"!!! I don't believe it! Phoenix: (Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?) December 25Gourd LakePublic Beach Maya: Wowsers! This is \"Gourd Lake\"? Phoenix: Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a \"wowsers,\" though. Maya: Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand! Phoenix: \"Samurai Dogs\"...? Maya: I wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great! Phoenix: With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be? Maya: They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into \"The Pink Princess\" now. I mean, like, y'know!? Phoenix: (Nope.) Examine Lake Maya: Wow. Gourd Lake is really big. Phoenix: Yeah. Maya: Say, Nick. Why is it called \"Gourd Lake\"? Phoenix: Oh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here. Maya: Whoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape? Phoenix: Well, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence. Maya: Oh. Okay. Trash can Phoenix: The trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained. Bench Phoenix: A lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog. Sign Phoenix: Huh... I almost didn't see that signpost. \"Left - Boat docks\" \"Right - Exit\" Vendor stand Phoenix: A hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads \"Samurai Dogs\"... Somebody needs to redecorate. Popper Maya: Huh. Someone left some poppers here. You know, you pull the string... (Changed from [Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...] in the original release) Phoenix: ...And it goes \"pop.\" Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's. Maya: Hey, Nick! They might be a clue! (Changed from [Hey, Nick! It might be a clue!] in the original release) Let's take them. (Changed from [Let's take it.] in the original release) Phoenix: C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop them, right? (Changed from [C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?] in the original release) Maya: Was it that obvious? Phoenix: (Poppers... hmm.) (Changed from [A popper... hmm.] in the original release) Take them (Changed from [Take it] in the original release) Phoenix: I suppose it couldn't hurt. Huh? Where'd they go? (Changed from [Huh? Where'd it go?] in the original release) Maya: Into my pocket. (Changed from [I already put it in my pocket.] in the original release) Poppers put in pocket. (Changed from [Popper put in pocket.] in the original release) Leads back to examination Leave them (Changed from [Leave it] in the original release) Phoenix: Nah, let's leave them. (Changed from [Nah, let's leave it.] in the original release) Maya: Aww, listen to your inner child a little, Nick! Phoenix: (Maybe if you outer child would be quiet for just a moment, Maya!) Leads back to examination Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Anything else Maya: Nick! If we don't hurry Mr. Edgeworth will get the death sentence!!! Phoenix: Whoa! O-okay! Let's go check things out. Detention Center Present Anything else Edgeworth: What's that? I'm not in the mood for idle banter, Wright. December 25Boat Rental Shop Maya: Nick... what is this place? Phoenix: A boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either. Maya: Boats... I've never ridden on a boat. Phoenix: Really? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished? Maya: Hey, good idea! You bet! Examine Trees Phoenix: There's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there. Shop Phoenix: A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas. Boats Phoenix: There are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder? Maya: Nick? Phoenix: Huh? Maya: I changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride. December 25Gourd Lake Woods Maya: I like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping! Phoenix: They've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder. Maya: Hey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder! Phoenix: (That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them. Examine Camera Maya: Hey, Nick. Check out this camera! Phoenix: Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard. Maya: Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"YO! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK! Phoenix: Will you stop that? Maya: I think it's broken, Nick. Phoenix: D-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.) Camera (after Popper is added to the Court Record) Leads to: \"This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment.\" Trees Phoenix: The trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them. Sign Phoenix: The sign says \"No Camping.\" Funny place to pick to pitch your tent. Maya: Wait, what if the sign said \"No Setting Tents on Fire\"? Phoenix: ... I don't think they have signs like that. Maya: Oh... Sheet Phoenix: There's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold. Campfire Maya: Hey, Nick! Phoenix: What, don't tell me you're hungry again? Maya: No, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum? Phoenix: ... They didn't talk about that in any of the law books. Maya: So, there's no law saying they have to be made out of aluminum, then! Phoenix: (I'm not having this conversation...) SUV Phoenix: This SUV has seen better days. It's dented all over. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here. Phoenix: This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise. Maya: Wow! Cool! Let's try it out! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"HEY! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK! Phoenix: Will you stop that? Maya: Maybe it's broken? Phoenix: D-don't kick it! Maybe it isn't set up to respond to voices? Maya: Well what then? These things? (Changed from [Well what then? I know!] in the original release) Phoenix: The party poppers...? (Changed from [The party popper...?] in the original release) *BANG* klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik Maya: ... Well. It responded. (Changed from [... Yep. It responded.] in the original release) ???: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw! Hey, you! Git yer hands offa' that! Maya: Eek! ???: What in the Sam Hill...!? Look what ya done now! There goes a whole roll of film! Maya: Ah? Wha... huh? S-sorry! ???: Sorry's nice but it don't pay my bills! Y'all know how much a roll of that film costs!? Maya: I-I'll pay you back! ???: What were ya'll thinkin' settin' off a party-popper in a place like this? Maya: Uh... well... ???: What! Don't try to play stupid with me just 'cause you think I'm some country bumpkin! Yeah, I know how y'all Yanks think! \"I say, those southern folks talk with that exaggerated drawl, why they must be dumb!\" Well let me tell you, just because I might be dumb don't mean we all are! Maya: N-Nick, help! ???: And who are you, now? Her chaperone? Phoenix: Yeah, uh, no, rather, uhh... we're sort of... friends? ???: Jus' figure out what y'all are gonna say and say it for bejeezum's sake! Gawd, I'd rather sit through one of papa's drawls than listen to you stutter all day. Phoenix: (Oh boy... I guess we should pay her for the film...) ???: Watch it! Phoenix: Yes ma'am. (On second thought, I'll pay later...) Maya: I'm really sorry! Examine Camera Phoenix: This camera is rigged to respond to noise. But it only responds to loud noises... like a party popper. Talk Any option Phoenix: Ummm... ???: What!? Can't ya see I'm changin' the film on my camera here! Someone--I'm not namin' any names--but someone used up a WHOLE ROLL. Maya: Sorry... Phoenix: (That didn't work... I wonder if I have anything to show her that would get her attention...) Present Attorney's Badge Leads to: \"I, er, this is my badge.\" Phoenix: I, er, this is my badge. ???: Huh? Aren't badges supposed t' be all shiny and impressive? You a cop or something? Phoenix: Umm... I'm a lawyer. ???: Wh-what!? Y'all ain't gonna try and pull one o' them lawsuits on me over that film now? Cause I'll have you know I'm a fighter and I wrassled meaner looking' things'n you! Phoenix: N-no, that's not it at all. We're here investigating a murder that took place here, on the lake. ???: A murder...? ... Sounds cool! Why didn't y'all say that in the first place! Go ahead, ask me anything ya like! Phoenix: (Finally! Some cooperation!) ???: You too. Y'all can come out of hiding now. I won't bite. Hard. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, where did Maya get to?) Maya: S-sorry... I-I was feeling a little overwhelmed. The culture gap and all... ???: Never you mind, honey. I kin' talk Yank for ya if... ahem... if it pleases you? Maya: Th-thanks. I think I'll be okay. Lotta: Great then! I'm Lotta, Lotta Hart, but y'all can call me Lotta! I'm here photographing meteor showers for a research project. Mighty pleased ta meet ya! Talk What happened Lotta: Oh yeah, when was that murder, anyway? I ain't seen much television lately. Phoenix: It happened late in the night on Christmas Eve. Lotta: That so? Christmas Eve? Phoenix: A man on a boat was shot... Did you see anything? Lotta: Well, lemme see. A boat, ya say? I reckon I mighta seen one... not sure though. Y'all gotta remember I've been watching this here lake for a good three days now. I seen enough boats to choke a mule. Kinda hard to remember which I seen when. Lotta Maya: So, what is it you do, Lotta? Lotta: Huh? Me? Hah hah. Y'all don't really want to know that, do ya? Actually, I'm a research student at Country U., right in the heart of the heartland. Maya: Wow! Neat! Nick! She's a research student at a university! Country U.! Phoenix: Uh... so I hear. Maya: So, when did you come up here? Lotta: Hmm, lemme see... I guess it was 'bout three days ago. Phoenix: What are you photographing? Lotta: D-didn't I tell y'all that already? Meteors! Yep, meteor showers! Phoenix: (Falling stars...?) The camera (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: That's quite a camera you have there. Lotta: Y'all better know it! It's German-made. A genuine Solingen! Phoenix: (Isn't that where they make knives...?) Maya: Umm... So, what's that device you have stuck to the camera? Lotta: Huh? Device? Maya: It started moving all by itself when I fired my party popper... Lotta: Oh that? That triggers the shutter whenever it detects certain sounds. It's programmed to pick up loud noises right now. Maya: A programmable camera! Neat! Lotta's Camera added to the Court Record. The camera (subsequent times) Maya: That's quite a camera you have there. Lotta: Y'all better know it! It's German-made. A genuine Solingen! Phoenix: (Isn't that where they make knives...?) Maya: Umm... So, what's that device you have stuck to the camera? Lotta: Huh? Device? Maya: It started moving all by itself when I fired my party popper... Lotta: Oh that? That triggers the shutter whenever it detects certain sounds. It's programmed to pick up loud noises right now. Maya: A programmable camera! Neat! Present Attorney's Badge Lotta: So yer a lawyer, huh? Tell the truth, yer badge is a lot more impressive than you are. Maya: Hah hah! Phoenix: *glare* Maya: Hah... hah... oh. Ahem. Lotta's Camera Leads to: \"Lotta?\" Phoenix: Lotta? Lotta: Yeah? Phoenix: So, your camera... it triggers on loud explosion noises? Lotta: Ayup. Phoenix: Actually, the victim in the case we're researching--he was shot with a pistol. Lotta: A pistol...? Phoenix: Right. Now wouldn't a gunshot make a similar noise to our party popper...? Lotta: I guess it would. Phoenix: Your camera... didn't get a picture of the murder, did it? Lotta: ... Hey! Y'all are pretty bright! Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: I see what yer sayin'... Tell ya what, I'll have a look-see at my film. Phoenix: It would have been a photo taken late last night... Lotta: I checked 'em once, don't remember if there was anything on 'em though. But what if I got sumtin'! I could be witness to a genuine murder! Yeehaw! I'll go check that film. Y'all come back now, y'hear? Maya: She went inside her SUV. I guess we should come back later... Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Lotta's Camera Maya: Who was that with the camrea...? Lotta something? Let's go talk to her about that photograph! After presenting Lotta's Camera in Gourd Lake Woods: December 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Maya: ... I guess Detective Gumshoe is still in that meeting. Gumshoe: Hey! Thanks for coming down, pal! Maya: Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: We just finished the meeting. For better or for worse... Phoenix: (I get the feeling we're in for some bad news...) Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"All right, hands against the wall, all o' you... Don't even think about escaping! I got eyes in the back of my head!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for arrests. Talk The victim Phoenix: Do you know anything about the victim yet? Gumshoe: No, no... Still can't I.D. him. Maya: Has Mr. Edgeworth said anything? Gumshoe: Not a word. The meeting Phoenix: So, how did the meeting go? Gumshoe: I can't tell you, pal! You're a lawyer! Phoenix: T-true... Gumshoe: ... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that? Maya: So, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...? Gumshoe: Well, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled. Maya: I see... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Umm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting! Gumshoe: ... Don't go telling anyone else, pal. Phoenix: Y-yes, sir! Gumshoe: And... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us. Maya: Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. Trusting Edgeworth (appears after \"The meeting\") Maya: Detective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much? Gumshoe: Well, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works. Maya: A \"working relationship\"? Gumshoe: See, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared \"guilty\" every time. Yeah, his methods might be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us. Maya: I see... Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust... And you have my word on that! The autopsy report (appears after \"Trusting Edgeworth\") Phoenix: I was wondering, did you ever get that autopsy report? Gumshoe: Oh, that? Yeah, I made a copy for you. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Added Autopsy Report to the Court Record.] in the original release) Phoenix: Thank you. Maya: ...Nick? Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Can you show me that photo of the victim? ... That face...! Phoenix: Someone you know? Maya: I... I don't know. I just have this feeling that I met him somewhere a long time ago. ... The autopsy report (subsequent times) Maya: ... Phoenix: (Maya seems lost in thought.) You remember anything? Maya: ... Phoenix: (Guess not.) Present Autopsy Report Gumshoe: Well, I hope it helps you, pal. Phoenix: Thanks, Detective. Anything else Gumshoe: Sorry, I'm drawing a blank right now. Wright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"The autopsy report\" Talk option in Police Department - Criminal Affairs) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: Oh. Nothing... Just, something's been bothering me. ... Could you show me that autopsy report once more? ... ... ... Hey! I-I remember now! This guy! This is a lawyer that was at that office Mia worked at! I met him once when I went there to hang out with Sis! Phoenix: That office...? Wait! You mean Grossberg's office? Maya: Right! That guy! Phoenix: (That was the last name I expected to come up... Maybe I should go talk to him... for old time's sake.) Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: Hmm... The police have pretty much made up their minds that Mr. Edgeworth did it. And Mr. Edgeworth won't tell us anything. I guess we could go look for clues down by the lake? Phoenix: Right. Any ideas Phoenix: Well? Penny for your thoughts? Maya: Thoughts... Thoughts... Yeah, why won't Mr. Edgeworth tell us anything? And... and... And why did he refuse to ask for our help? What a jerk! Present Autopsy Report Maya: Nick... This person was a lawyer at Grossberg's office. Let's go talk to him! Mr. Grossberg, I mean, not the dead guy. December 25Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: It's been a while since I was here last. Mr. Grossberg is out as usual. Maya: Hey, Nick. Look at the wall. Phoenix: (That painting is still missing... Mia must have known about the deal with Mr. Grossberg and Redd White... She kept track of all of White's extortion and blackmail rackets.) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read. Maya: Well then let's take them back to our office! He won't miss them! Phoenix: Uh, we don't need them. Maya: Then, can we take that wooden bear? Phoenix: (Hmm. It is kind of cute.) Desk Phoenix: A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster. Maya: Hey, Nick! I want a desk like that in our office too! Phoenix: I don't know. I don't think I'm ready to sit at a desk like that yet. Maya: Huh? I meant for me! Phoenix: You'd better start saving your allowance, then. Vacant wall Maya: Why is the wall there a different color? Phoenix: A big painting was hanging there until recently. Maya: Huh. What happened to it? Phoenix: Uh... well, he gave it to someone. Maya: I bet he gave it to some romantic interest! Love blooms eternal, Nick! Phoenix: Uh... yeah. Potted plant Phoenix: An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available. Maya: I think our Charley is cuter. Phoenix: Right. He's a really cute... plant. Table Phoenix: A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn. Maya: We should put things on our client table too. Phoenix: I'm not really into smoking. Maya: We could put out candy, or gum. Phoenix: Classy... Detention Center Present Autopsy Report Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry. I can't think of anything I want to say about that. After clearing \"The autopsy report\" Talk option in Police Department - Criminal Affairs: December 25Gourd Lake Woods Lotta: Hey y'all! Maya: Lotta! Lotta: Wait up a sec! We got bingo! Maya: Bingo...? Lotta: My automatic camera took two pictures last night! Maya: Hey! Lotta: This is them. Take a look! Phoenix: Wait...! Lotta: See? See? He's shooting him with that pistol! Phoenix: I-it looks like that, yes. Maya: But you can't really tell who that is shooting. Lotta: Yeah, well there was enough fog out there last night t' strangle a bullfrog. But, y'know... Seeing these photos reminded me of something. Maya: What...? Lotta: I saw the murder happen. I'm a witness! Maya: Whaaaaaaa!? Phoenix: A-are you serious!? Lotta: Course! Phoenix: (How do you forget... never mind.) Lotta: Y'all reckon I should tell the cops? I reckon so Phoenix: I... reckon so! Lotta: What's that? Now don't y'all go tryin' to mock my accent! I'm a sensitive lady! Leads to: \"Hey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops.\" I reckon no Phoenix: I... reckon no! Lotta: What's that? Now don't y'all think y'all can pull one over on me just cause you speak the lingo! I know enough to know that when you see a murder, you'd best tell the cops! It's my obligation as a citizen! Leads to: \"Hey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops.\" Lotta: Hey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops. Y'all can have this photo. Later. Phoenix: W-w-wait! Lotta! Lotta: What? Can't y'all see I'm kinda busy? Phoenix: T-tell us what you saw, too! Please? Lotta: Nice try, honey, but I wasn't born yesterday. I'm a witness, and that means I'm on the side of justice, and that means the cops! I'd sooner eat the south side of a north-bound skunk than tell you! Maya: L-Lotta! Lotta: Don't let it get your skivvies in a bunch. Friends today, enemies tomorrow! Or was that the other way round? No matter. I'm gone! Hey! Maybe they'll let me do some testifying! Hot darn! Maya: She left... ... Well, that's one more witness. What do we do now, Nick? Phoenix: (Well, if she saw something, there's not much we can do about it. The question is: what exactly did she see...? I guess we'll find out in the trial tomorrow.) Lake Photo added to the Court Record. Examine Camera Phoenix: An expensive-looking camera faces the lake. Next to it is a large microphone and a blue plastic sheet. Hmm. Looks like a computer is attached to the camera. December 25Gourd LakePublic Beach Maya: Looks like the police have given up their interviewing. (Changed from [Looks like the police have given up their questioning.] in the original release) ???: Hey! Maya: Aah! N-Nick! I think Santa's mad at you! ???: Long time no see, Nick. Maya: Nick... you know Santa!? Wow... Nick and St. Nick... Hey! I see the connection! Phoenix: Don't be ridiculous! ???: Dude, it's me! Phoenix: L... Larry! What are you doing here!? Butz: Isn't it obvious? I'm working my day job! I sell Samurai Dogs! Want one? Gotta get money for dates, you know, My girl Kiyance deserves the best! Phoenix: (K-Kiyance...? Not another model, I hope...) Butz: Oh, Kiyance's a fine, fine woman, Nick. It was her idea that I wear this costume! She was all \"You go girlfriend!\" Y'know? She bought this costume for me! Phoenix: That... that's great, Larry. Maya: Wow! A Santa costume! She must be really nice! Butz: Whoa! Cute! Nick! Who's she? She's not your...? Phoenix: Not my... what? N-no, she's not! Maya: I'm his partner, Maya Fey. I'm, uh, the little sister. Butz: Sister...? ... Wow, Nick, must be tough. Working nine to five, having to take care of a little sister... Maya: N-no, I'm not Nick's sister, I'm my older sister's little sister... Butz: Huh. Sounds great! Phoenix: (Don't worry, Maya, he's not listening...) Examine Bench Maya: Hey, Nick, benches! Let's take a break... maybe have a dog? Phoenix: I think not. It's too cold to sit and eat hotdogs out here! Maya: Wimpy city boy! You should try standing under a freezing waterfall some time! Stand Phoenix: I can't get over the Samurai Dogs... Maya: The \"Original\" Samurai Dogs, no less. Butz: Hey, man, whoever calls their product the \"original\" first wins! Phoenix: Why don't you add \"world-famous\" to the sign? Butz: Hey, good idea! Phoenix: (What have I done...?) Talk What happened Phoenix: Hey, Larry. There was a murder here last night... And since you work here... Have you heard anything? (Changed from [You work here. Have you heard anything?] in the original release) Maya: Nick, you're wasting your time. Last night was Christmas Eve! He was with Kiyance, obviously! He wouldn't have been standing out here in the cold! Butz: Oof! Maya: ? Phoenix: I think what you just said caught him off guard, Maya. Butz: N-no, it's just... Kiyance's not in town right now. She... she's in Hawaii on a photo shoot. Phoenix: (A model. I knew it.) Well, anyway, there was a murder here on the lake. The trial's tomorrow. Butz: Huh. Neat. Phoenix: The defendant is Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. Maya: Um, Nick? Why would Larry know Edgeworth...? Butz: Whoa, Nick! You don't mean THAT Miles Edgeworth!? Old Edgey!? Phoenix: Yeah. He's a murder suspect. Butz: Wh-whoa! Murder? Maya: Huh? You know Mr. Edgeworth, Larry? Butz: Yeah! Of course! Edgey was in the same class as us in grade school! Maya: Whaaaaaaaaat!? Samurai Dogs Maya: Umm... umm... tell me about the dogs! Butz: Huh? Oh, you mean the Samurai Dogs? Maya: W-why are they Samurai Dogs? I... I mean they kind of look gourd-shaped. Butz: Oh, well originally, they were Gourd Dogs! Y'know, like \"guard dogs\"? Maya: Ouch... Butz: The Samurai thing was Kiyance's idea. Oh, she's my woman, y'know. She was all \"change the name and you go girlfriend!\" She made me that banner! Man, the kids can't get enough of those Samurai Dogs! Maya: Err... Something about that just seems... wrong. Butz: Oh, and guess what? We're getting a ton of customers here at the lake, what with the big news! Maya: The \"big news\"...? Butz: Yeah! Gourdy! Maya: G-\"Gourdy\"...? Edgeworth (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, Mr. Edgeworth was your classmate, Larry? Butz: Yeah, Nick, him, and I used to hang out all the time. Maya: Wow... I never knew. Butz: Don't get me wrong. He's always been kind of a stick in the mud. Studying all the time, trying to \"be like father.\" Maya: Like his father...? Butz: Yeah. Edgey's pop was a famous defense lawyer back in the day. Maya: Wow. Wait... You said \"defense lawyer\"? Butz: Yeah. Maya: Wait a second! But Mr. Edgeworth is a prosecuting attorney! Butz: What? Edgey's got a proboscis on his knee!? Maya: No, no--he's a \"prosecuting attorney.\" That's like the total opposite of a defense lawyer! Butz: ... Huh. Go figure! He always used to talk about defending the \"weak\" who were \"unable to defend themselves.\" Man, he used to go on and on about man's duty to society and all that. What a bore! I wonder what changed his mind, though? Do you know, Nick? Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick...? Gourdy (appears after \"Samurai Dogs\") Maya: Umm... what's \"Gourdy\"? Butz: Huh? You mean you don't know? It's here, in this very lake! A giant, mysterious monster! Gourdy! Maya: A... monster? Butz: Yeah. Check it out. This is an article from yesterday's newspaper. There's a photo! Maya: Wow! It's r-really real! Nick! A monster! A real monster! Phoenix: Umm... yeah. (It's probably just a log or something... right?) Hey... there's a quote here from the person who took the photo. Hmm? What's this? \"I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud 'bang'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water...\" Maya: I wish I could have seen it! Phoenix: (Why would there be a sound like an explosion...?) Larry. Could I borrow this article from you? Butz: Sure, no problem. That'll be one million dollars! Maya: O-one million...? Phoenix: (Grow up, Larry.) Gourdy Article added to the Court Record. Gourdy (subsequent times) Maya: Hey Nick, show me that article once more. \"I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud 'bang'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water...\" How romantic! And cool! I mean, to think, a real monster! Butz: Yeah. I'm just glad I'm selling more dogs! Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Huh? Oh, that's your attorney's badge, isn't it? Dude, you really helped me out back in that trial. S-sorry, I can't really pay you. Phoenix: (Cause you blow it all on \"Kiyance\"...!) Butz: But... you can have all the dogs you want! Maya: R-really!? Phoenix: Larry... If you let her at your dogs, you won't have any left for the other customers. Butz: Hey, no problem. If that's what makes her happy, y'know? Phoenix: (How many times do I have to remind you that it was ME who got you off the hook!) Lotta's Camera Butz: Whazzat? Phoenix: It's a camera. You take pictures with it. Butz: Huh? Maya: L-Larry! You mean you don't know what a camera is!? Butz: C-course I know! Hey, you're looking at a bona fide junior high graduate! I was talking about the weird contraption on that camera! Phoenix: Oh, that. Well... it's hard to explain. Just forget about it. Butz: Well don't go showing me it, then! Geez! Autopsy Report Phoenix: Hey Larry, you know this guy? Butz: Who's this? Phoenix: I don't know. That' why I asked you. Butz: Who's this, Maya? Maya: Well... Lake Photo Butz: W-what's this? You know, my eyes have been getting pretty bad lately, Nick... Phoenix: Actually, the photo's blurry, Larry. It was taken last night. Butz: Last night...? Anything else Butz: Sorry, Nick. I don't know much about that. I'm just a simple vendor of Samurai Dogs, dig? December 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Maya: ... Not a Gumshoe in sight. Police: If you're looking for Detective Gumshoe, he's in the questioning room. Apparently, an important witness turned up. He'll be in there for a while. Maya: Lotta Hart... it has to be. Phoenix: Uh oh... Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"...move in the crowd. Wear drab clothes... Never enter the target's field of vision...\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for trailing. Detention Center Present Lake Photo Edgeworth: Hmph... Who would have thought there'd be a photo...? Phoenix: Edgeworth... Did you shoot him? Edgeworth: ... What do you think, Wright? Phoenix: I don't think you're the kind to point a gun at anyone, no. Maya: So you didn't shoot him? Edgeworth: No, I didn't. It wasn't me.

You're Mia's... something, are you not? Phoenix: I was her understudy, yes. Phoenix Wright. Grossberg: Ah hah! And you, you're Mia's... something too, are you not? Maya: Her little sister, yes! Grossberg: You've grown! You've come to look a lot like your sister, you know? It takes me back. \"Ahh... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...\" you see. Phoenix: Um, Mr. Grossberg, sir? Grossberg: Hmm...? Ah, yes. I beg your pardon. Of course you came here to discuss something. What is it then? Something the matter? Talk What happened Phoenix: There was a murder last night... Grossberg: A murder? Phoenix: You haven't heard...? Grossberg: I, er, just got up, you see. Phoenix: Well, Miles Edgeworth shot someone with a pistol. Grossberg: Edgeworth!? What!? W-who!? Phoenix: Well, the identity of the victim is still unknown. Grossberg: T-this is terrible news indeed! Phoenix: (I guess he hadn't heard anything...) That painting Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg? Whatever happened to that painting? Grossberg: Oh, yes... I do not think it shall ever be coming back home to this office. I can't exactly claim it as stolen... I suppose it's my just desserts. Old, bitter desserts. Robert Hammond (appears after presenting Autopsy Report) Phoenix: Who is this Hammond guy, anyway? Grossberg: Mr. Hammond... He was the defense attorney in that case... Phoenix: \"That case\"...? Grossberg: Yes, the \"DL-6 Incident.\" Phoenix: \"DL-6\"...? (Why does that sound so familiar?) Grossberg: Perhaps you remember? Phoenix: (I'm sure someone mentioned it during the trial for Mia's murder.) Grossberg: That was the incident where the police were so at a loss they used a spirit medium. Maya: ...! Wait... you don't mean? Was that medium my mother? Grossberg: Yes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss. No conviction was made. The DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Robert Hammond\") Grossberg: The DL-6 Incident, yes... Happened 15 years ago. A very strange case, indeed. Phoenix: They never caught the criminal, right? Grossberg: Correct. Misty Fey used her powers to talk to the spirit of the late victim. Her testimony led to charges being laid against one man. But Mr. Hammond won the case and the suspect was declared innocent. Maya: ... And the police blamed my mother, calling her a fraud. You were the one who helped her out then, right, Mr. Grossberg? Grossberg: Er... y-yes. Yes, quite. Maya: Thank you! Grossberg: N-no... please. D-don't mention it. Phoenix: ... (DL-6... Never thought I'd hear that name again...) Maya: But wait... What does this case have anything to do with Mr. Edgeworth? Grossberg: It has everything to do with Mr. Edgeworth, my dear! The victim in the DL-6 Incident was none other than his father, Gregory Edgeworth! Maya: Wh-what!? His father!? Grossberg: ... If you want to know more, you should ask him yourself. Show him this... I'm sure he'll talk to you. Maya: Wait... This is a photograph of my mother! Misty Fey's Photo added to the Court Record. The DL-6 Incident (subsequent times) Grossberg: The DL-6 Incident, yes...

Present Attorney's Badge Grossberg: You've really grown up in the past few years, my dear! How proud Mia would be if she could see you now! Maya: She said she was more worried about me than anything. Phoenix: Aww, just go on and take the compliment, will you? Lotta's Camera Grossberg: So, this camera on the lake takes a photo whenever it hears an explosion sound? Maya: That's what she said. Grossberg: And it just happened to be set up on the beach, pointing out on the lake? Maya: Yes... she said it was to photograph \"shooting stars.\" Grossberg: Hmm. Shooting stars... explosions... what's the connection? I'd be suspicious of this witness of yours. Autopsy Report Grossberg: Hmm? Strange... I feel as though I've seen this man somewhere before! ... Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Did you remember!? Grossberg: He was a lawyer! Here, in my office! That's Hammond! Robert Hammond! Maya: Mr. Hammond...? Grossberg: And you say this is the man Miles Edgeworth shot? Lake Photo Grossberg: So this is the moment the crime took place, eh? Phoenix: Yes. Grossberg: You can't really say for sure that's Edgeworth. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Not sure at all... Misty Fey's Photo Grossberg: Misty Fey. Mother of Mia and Maya Fey. Show this photograph to Miles Edgeworth. He'll have something to say to you then. Anything else Grossberg: Er... my apologies. I'm not sure I can help you with that.

That probably wasn't the best thing to do.) December 25Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: What's this? I was hoping you'd gotten my message the first time. Phoenix: Edgeworth, what about your defense? Edgeworth: ...! It's no concern of yours. Phoenix: (Guess he hasn't found anyone yet.) Talk What happened Phoenix: Can I ask you about the murder? Edgeworth: Wright. I'll ask you again, just leave me alone. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: Please try to understand. I'm not doing this to prove I'm tough, or because I look down on you. I just don't want you anywhere near this case. Understand? Gourd Lake Phoenix: Why did you go to Gourd Lake? Edgeworth: I have no intention of telling you. Phoenix: Nor, apparently, would you tell Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: ! Maya: Detective Gumshoe was really worried about you! Edgeworth: ... The DL-6 Incident (appears after presenting Misty Fey's Photo) Edgeworth: The \"DL-6 Incident\"... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all. Maya: ...! Edgeworth: My memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name. Phoenix: And Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder? Edgeworth: Correct. Maya: Umm... That spirit medium... that was my mom. Edgeworth: What? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this. Phoenix: \"About to end\"? Edgeworth: The DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28. Maya: December 28? Edgeworth: The statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days. Phoenix: What!? Maya: Um, Nick? What does that mean? Phoenix: When a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened. Edgeworth: Three days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever. The suspect (appears after \"The DL-6 Incident\") Maya: What happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent? Edgeworth: I don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now. Phoenix: (I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.) Your father (appears after \"The DL-6 Incident\") Maya: Umm... so, was your father a lawyer? Edgeworth: He was... Gregory Edgeworth. He was quite famous at the time, apparently. Maya: So, you were sort of trying to follow in his footsteps. Edgeworth: ... I'd rather not talk about it. Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Your attorney's badge...? I can't say I really want to see one of those right now. Misty Fey's Photo Edgeworth: ...! ... Phoenix: Edgeworth? Edgeworth: It's only been a matter of hours since you last visited. Yet you've made incredible progress in your investigation. I'll admit it, I'm impressed, Wright. You were always single-minded in your work, though. Once you start on something, you always see it through, don't you? Phoenix: About the \"DL-6 Incident\"... Edgeworth: Right... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6. Phoenix: So... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away? Edgeworth: I don't know. But... I see no point in hiding anything from you now. Very well. Ask whatever you like, and I will answer to the best of my abilities.

Edgeworth: Not me. Leads to: \"This is my chance to finally pay you back.\" Of course we won't Phoenix: Sorry, charley! No way! Edgeworth: Wright... Maya: Nick...!? ... Phoenix: H-hey, don't look so serious, guys! I was kidding! Just a little joke! Edgeworth: There was nothing little... Maya: ...or joke-like about it! Phoenix: (I thought it was funny...) Maya: Nick! Do it over! Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. How could I refuse you, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Thank you, Wright. Leads to: \"This is my chance to finally pay you back.\" Phoenix: This is my chance to finally pay you back. Maya: Pay him back...? Edgeworth: Pay me back? For what? I don't remember ever doing anything for you. Phoenix: Never mind... I guess you don't really need to know. Edgeworth: Huh... My letter of request. Please give it to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth's Request put in pocket. Phoenix: Well, I guess we should... ... W-what's that!? Maya: E-earthquake! Nick! It's a big one! Whaaaaa! I-it's calming down... ... Whew... that was scary! Phoenix: ...? Huh? Where's Edgeworth? Maya: ... There. He's on the floor in a ball, shivering. I guess he doesn't do so well with earthquakes. Phoenix: (I've heard of running, but curling up in a ball?) Maya: Well, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick. Phoenix: Uh.. right. We have to give Edgeworth's letter of request to Detective Gumshoe. Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. After Edgeworth's Request is added to the Court Record: December 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Gumshoe: What's going on here!? Maya: Eek! Phoenix: W-what's wrong, Detective? Gumshoe: This wild lady comes in here just a while ago... Says she came \"to talk to y'all after hearing what Mr. Wright had to say\"! What's this all about, pal!? Phoenix: (Lotta Hart...) Gumshoe: Why are you going around finding more witnesses!? You want to give Mr. Edgeworth the death sentence, pal!? Phoenix: N-no, not at all... Just... I mean, she did see something. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't go around covering up evidence! Gumshoe: Er... You trying to say something about the way I do my job? Phoenix: No sir! Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"Never talk to people in the neighborhood... Turn all the lights in the room off, and close the curtains...\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for a stake-out. Talk Lotta's testimony Phoenix: So... what did Ms. Hart say? Gumshoe: She says she saw Mr. Edgeworth fire the pistol. Maya: What!? Gumshoe: She even had a photograph to prove it. Phoenix: Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting. Gumshoe: That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\" Maya: She can do that!? Phoenix: (Okay, so there's going to be an enlarged photograph that shows Edgeworth in the act. Great. Just great.) Gumshoe: In any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow. Maya: Huh? What happened to the other witness? Gumshoe: Well... Apparently, there was a cancellation. Phoenix: (A \"cancellation\"...!?) Tomorrow's trial Gumshoe: I'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out. Phoenix: (I'd say that sounds like a pretty unwinnable case... But wait... What did Mia used to say? If he's innocent, there's got to be something I've overlooked...) Edgeworth Gumshoe: It sound like Mr. Edgeworth is going to ask the state to assign a public defender. I was just asked to file the paperwork. But you still got time, pal! Go talk to him again, for me, please! You have to convince him! You have to make him let you defend him! Please! I know you're the only one who can do it, pal. You're the only one who can save Mr. Edgeworth! Present Edgeworth's Request Leads to: \"Look what I got.\" Anything else Gumshoe: Hey, pal, there's only one thing I want to see from you! And that's a letter of request from Mr. Edgeworth for you to be his defense attorney! Phoenix: Look what I got. Gumshoe: ... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you! Phoenix: Thanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then. Gumshoe: Good luck, pal. Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried! Maya: Worried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now. Gumshoe: Oh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth! Phoenix: (Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it. Gumshoe: Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later! Maya: ... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes? Phoenix: I wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school. Phoenix: (Then again, I only really got to know him in 4th grade. (Changed from [Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade.] in the original release) He transferred to another school after that. I wonder what happened to Edgeworth...) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Goodbyes Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 December 26, 9:44 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2 Phoenix: Karma...? (ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release) Edgeworth: That's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god! Maya: Not a single case? Edgeworth: He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything. Phoenix: Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared. Phoenix: (That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...) Edgeworth: He taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\" Phoenix: Wh-what!? Edgeworth: Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten. Maya: Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Something like that... Maya: And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out. Edgeworth: Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty! Maya: That's pretty ruthless... Edgeworth: Like I said. He's a god among prosecutors. Phoenix: (I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya? Maya: Uh huh? Phoenix: We could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think? Maya: Oh... Phoenix: ? Maya: I can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach. Phoenix: You couldn't \"reach\"? Maya: I think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again... Phoenix: Oh man, what bad timing! Maya: I'm really sorry. I'll try my best! Phoenix: I hope so! Edgeworth: What are you whispering about? Phoenix: O-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in... December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Karma: ... Judge: Err, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready? Karma: ... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared? Judge: R-right, my apologies! Phoenix: (He's even got the Judge scared!) Judge: Very well, your opening statement, please. Karma: ... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required? Judge: Ah... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness. Maya: What's with this guy? Is he royalty or something? Phoenix: How am I supposed to fight against this!? Karma: I call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe. Phoenix: (Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.) Karma: Describe the incident. Now! Gumshoe: Y-yessir! Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...) Gumshoe: Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop. Karma: Hmm. Overhead Map added to the Court Record. Karma: Testify to the court about your arrest. Now! Judge: W-w-wait! Mr. von Karma... Karma: Yes? Judge: Actually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings... Karma: Wrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word \"guilty.\" That is your role! Judge: Y-yes, of course. You're quite right. Phoenix: (No, he's not!!!) Witness Testimony -- The Arrest of Edgeworth -- Gumshoe: A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight. We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could. That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth. Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all. But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake. So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth. Judge: Hmm... I see. Very well... Karma: Begin your cross-examination, attorney. Now! Judge: ... Cross Examination -- The Arrest of Edgeworth -- Gumshoe: A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You received a call from a \"man\"? Gumshoe: Er... yup. Phoenix: But you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right? Karma: Karma: That woman and the \"man\" who called in the report are two different people, obviously! Phoenix: Different people? Karma: There were two witnesses! Phoenix: (Urk!) Karma: Their testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping. Phoenix: (The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.) Karma: What happened next, Detective? Gumshoe: We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake? Gumshoe: Er, well... I'd say it was about three minutes. Phoenix: That's pretty fast! Gumshoe: Our motto for the month is \"get there quick.\" Karma: Karma: Detective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets! Gumshoe: Y-yessir! Sorry, sir! Karma: Do that, and you'll be able to look forward to your next salary review. Gumshoe: So much to look forward to, these days... Karma: This is no time for daydreaming! Continue! Gumshoe: Y-yessir! Gumshoe: That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then? Gumshoe: Well... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really. Karma: Karma: Detective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts! Gumshoe: Y-y-yessir! Phoenix: (Man, he's got his share of objections...) Gumshoe: Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why didn't you think he was suspicious? Gumshoe: You should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors. Karma: Karma: Detective! The court isn't interested in your musings! \"Deep\"? \"Trusting\"? Poppycock! I've never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force! Gumshoe: Mmph! Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe doesn't look so good...) Karma: Continue! Now! Gumshoe: But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you find any clues on the body? Gumshoe: A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally. Karma: Judge! Here's the bullet... It didn't strike bone, so its shape is well preserved. Judge: Very well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence. Pistol Bullet added to the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you find any clues on the body? Gumshoe: A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally. Gumshoe: So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: W-why is that? Gumshoe: Well, we found the murder weapon in the boat. Phoenix: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: A pistol. Judge: Detective Gumshoe... That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony. Gumshoe: Right! S-sorry, Your Honor. Changes statement from \"So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\" to \"The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.\" Gumshoe: The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"? Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Phoenix: (Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...) Gumshoe: There were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Judge: Order! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!? Gumshoe: Y-yes, Your Honor. Karma: Judge! This is the weapon in question. Judge: A-accepted into evidence. Pistol added to the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: What about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"? Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Phoenix: (Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...) Gumshoe: There were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Maya: Nick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague? Phoenix: I bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press. Maya: What do we do? Phoenix: Grit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do? Maya: Well said, Nick! You're the man! After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement: Karma: Members of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective! Gumshoe: Y-y-yessir! Karma: Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol? Gumshoe: Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol. Judge: Hmm... Maya: Hey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"? Karma: Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings! Maya: N-Nick! He's glaring at me! Karma: Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it. Judge: Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate. Karma: Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints! Judge: O-order! Order! Phoenix: (This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!) Karma: Well, Judge? Judge: I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However... Karma: You wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge! Judge: Y-yes? Karma: What are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now! Judge: B-but, wait, I... Karma: Just bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man! Judge: Y-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess. Phoenix: (Who's running this court, anyway!?) December 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2 Phoenix: Edgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon! Edgeworth: Uh... hmm... Phoenix: And that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo! Edgeworth: True... Phoenix: Was that you in the boat? Edgeworth: ... Yes. It was me. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: But... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him. Phoenix: Th-then who did!? Edgeworth: I... don't know. Phoenix: You don't know!? Weren't you right there!? Edgeworth: ... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself! Phoenix: Y-you mean it was a suicide!? Edgeworth: ... That's the only explanation I can come up with. Phoenix: Huh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya? Maya: Huh? Wh-what? Phoenix: Any progress with Mia? Maya: Oh... Sorry. It's no good. Phoenix: Ugh... Maya: I know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right? No, I need you here Phoenix: No, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right? Maya: It's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better. Leads to: \"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\" Yeah, you're useless Phoenix: Um, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!) Maya: It's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything. Your face said it for you. Phoenix: (Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I'm sorry. Maya: It's okay Nick. Leads to: \"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\" Maya: I don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits... Phoenix: Aww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out! Maya: Really...? Edgeworth: W-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart... Phoenix: Oh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!) Judge: Court is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness. Karma: Yes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand? Karma: Lotta Hart, you are a research student at a university? Lotta: That I am. Karma: Good. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand? Lotta: ... Y'all need to learn some manners. Karma: UNDERSTAND? Lotta: Y-yeah, I understand, I understand! Judge: Er... very well. Your testimony, please. Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon. I was in my car. I heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake. When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat. Then there was another \"bang\"... There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat. Karma: Enough. Lotta: Huh? Karma: Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence. Judge: W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately! Karma: As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!! Judge: Order! Order! Order...! I will have order! Karma: ... Well, Judge? Judge: The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant... Phoenix: Phoenix: W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet! Karma: A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!? Phoenix: ...! Karma: Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court! Maya: Uh, Nick... contempt...? Phoenix: \"Contempt of court,\" you know? Maya: I... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony? I think there was Phoenix: I... think I noticed one little thing... Maya: Wow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on! Phoenix: Y-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Leads to: \"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\" I think there wasn't Phoenix: Honestly, I found nothing. Maya: I dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything! Phoenix: I bet von Karma probably fed her her lines. Maya: But... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will... Phoenix: He'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty. Maya: I guess we'll just have to bluff it. Phoenix: But if we mess up... contempt of court. Maya: Hey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt! Phoenix: Er... right. Leads to: \"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\" Phoenix: I understand... I will cross-examine the witness! Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Very well! Judge: I pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Just after midnight,\" you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day! Lotta: Huh? Uh, yeah, well, yes. Karma: Karma: I know you want to find contradictions, but really! Phoenix: Mmmph. Judge: I hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial. Lotta: I was in my car. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why were you camping there, anyway? Lotta: I'm a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research. Phoenix: (What research? This all sounds suspicious...) Press further Phoenix: Ms. Hart. Could you be more specific about your \"research\"? Karma: Karma: What does the witness's motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer \"is nothing\"! I object to this line of questioning! Objection sustained! Judge: W-w-wait, now, I'm the one who says that! Karma: Well, then say it already! Judge: Objection sustained. Phoenix: (Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...) Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (I think I'll let that one slide for now.) Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: I heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you weren't looking at the lake at that time? Lotta: Nope. I looked after I heard that noise. Karma: Karma: She's said that already! I asked you to find \"contradictions\"! Not leisurely chat with the witness! Phoenix: (Urk...) Lotta: When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Could you clearly see the two men? Lotta: Just look at the picture! Clear enough for you? Phoenix: (Uh oh...) Press further Phoenix: Wait a second! I wasn't asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men! Lotta: Uh, yeah, well, of course... Karma: Karma: The witness has testified that she saw them! There's also a photo! You'd best look elsewhere for your precious contradictions! Phoenix: (He jumped in quick... He's hiding something!) Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (I think I'd best let that one slide...) Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: Then there was another \"bang\"... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Were you watching the very moment the shot rang out? Lotta: Well, yeah, sure... Karma: Karma: You're asking meaningless questions! Meaningless! \"Contradictions,\" Mr. Wright. Not meaningless babble! Phoenix: (von Karma, I think I hate you. He's trying to keep me from talking to the witness... To what end...?) Lotta: There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure about that? Lotta: Yeah, sure as a country gal can be! Phoenix: (That sounds pretty sure.) Press further Phoenix: How come you're so sure? Lotta: Well, heck, I scanned the whole lake. Phoenix: (\"Scanned the whole lake\"? It almost sounds like she was more interested in the lake than the boat...) Ms. Hart... you-- Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! The witness has answered the question in full. Phoenix: Mmph! Karma: No need for further questions! Objection sustained! Judge: U-uh, that's what I'm... Karma: Sustained! Judge: Y-yes, of course. Phoenix: (Oh great... What am I supposed to do now?) Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (Lotta seems pretty sure of herself. I'd better not forge blindly ahead here. Still... this whole thing stinks.) Leads back to cross-examination Phoenix: (Th-there weren't any contradictions in there!) Maya: Sorry, Nick. If only my sister were here... Phoenix: (Maya's really taking this hard.) After selecting \"Press further\" upon pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements, and pressing fifth statement: Judge: Enough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting. Phoenix: B-but, Your Honor! Karma: You keep your promise! Judge: Mr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court! Karma: And if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...? Phoenix: Uh... uh huh. Maya: Nick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy! Phoenix: I... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do? Judge: I believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision. Karma: Then, pass your judgment! Judge: Very well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand. ???: Judge: Wh-who was that!? Maya: It... was me. Phoenix: (Maya!) Judge: I-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities? Maya: No, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death! Lotta: ...! Maya: Lotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!? Judge: You will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst! Maya: Answer me, Lotta! Lotta: What's the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth... Karma: Karma: Enough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court! Judge: Y-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave. Phoenix: (No... No...!) Wait! Maya: I-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent! Karma: Hah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Wrong Phoenix: Wrong! Karma: What!? Leads to: \"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\" Right Phoenix: (Dammit, he's right...) Maya: N-Nick! There must be something we can do! Phoenix: I... don't think there is. The cross-examination is over already! Maya: B-but... but didn't Lotta just say she saw him? She did, Nick! She just said that she saw Mr. Edgeworth! She didn't say that in her testimony, did she? Phoenix: ...! Y-you're right! Your Honor! Leads to: \"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\" Phoenix: Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Karma: You're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection! Judge: ... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot. Karma: What!? Judge: Ms. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again. Karma: B-but he is in contempt of court! Maya: No, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me! Judge: Hmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately. Maya: Nick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck! Phoenix: M-Maya...! Karma: Peh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses! Phoenix: (I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...) Judge: Mr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination! Cross Examination -- That Last Statement -- Lotta: I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, what about the other man? Karma: Karma: You cannot expect to be allowed to blithely ignore your promise, Mr. Wright! I believe you claimed there was a contradiction in the witness's testimony! Well, find it! If you can! Judge: Mr. Wright, I have to assign you a penalty. Phoenix: (Damn...!) Present Lake Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Got you.\" Phoenix: (That's it...? Uh oh. I don't know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?) Phoenix: Got you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally! Lotta: Wh-what!? You got what? Phoenix: Look at this photograph. Lotta: The photo I took...? Phoenix: The very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart. Lotta: So... so? Phoenix: This picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!? Lotta: Whut!? Wha--! Judge: Mr. Wright has a point! Karma: Karma: That's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please! Phoenix: Yet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself! Judge: Ms. Hart. Lotta: What! Judge: Could you see the defendant that night? Lotta: O-of course! I said I could and I meant I could! Judge: Then, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting. Phoenix: (I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!) Witness Testimony -- How Edgeworth Was Seen -- Lotta: Yer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits. So, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car. Still, I brought my binoculars with me. When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars. See? No problem! Judge: Hmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (This one'd better be good!) Cross Examination -- How Edgeworth Was Seen -- Lotta: Yer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So? How could you see Edgeworth!? Lotta: Now, just hold your horses for a second! You hasty Yankee types'd never find a gal where I'm from. Judge: Defense attorneys have trouble with that as it is. Phoenix: (Nobody loves me...) Lotta: So, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Your \"camera\"...? Lotta: Yeah. It's got an automatic... Karma: Karma: The issue we are concerned with here is Ms. Hart seeing Mr. Edgeworth! The camera has nothing to do with this at all! Judge: Objection sustained. Phoenix: (Argh! He's not letting her answer any of my questions!) Lotta: Still, I brought my binoculars with me. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Binoculars\"? Lotta: Yeah, binoculars. Phoenix: Yesterday, you mentioned that you were out looking for shooting stars, correct? Lotta: Well... yeah. Phoenix: Wouldn't you need a telescope, not binoculars, for that? Lotta: ...! Phoenix: I've got doubts about your camera, too! Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers? Karma: Karma: The camera is irrelevant to this case! Phoenix: You can't say that for certain! Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright. Is the camera really relevant to this case? If you believe it is, you may continue with this line of questioning. Karma: But know this! If you find nothing with this, there will be consequences! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Do you wish to press further about the camera? Press further Phoenix: (This is make-it-or-break-it time!) The camera is of utmost importance, Your Honor. It is, perhaps, the key to this entire case! Therefore, I will continue my line of questioning! (Wow! Maybe I went a little overboard there...) Judge: Very well! Ms. Hart! You will testify to the court about the camera! Lotta: Yeah, yeah, I hear ya. Changes statement from \"Still, I brought my binoculars with me.\" to \"The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.\" Hold back Phoenix: Okay, Your Honor... I withdraw my question. (I have to remember who I'm dealing with! I bet von Karma wants to trap me so he can put me in contempt! I think I'll hang back for now and see what happens.) Karma: Hah! Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Hart. What made you choose that lake to photograph meteors? You know the fog gets thick on that lake. It's not very suited to stargazing. Lotta: Yeah, well... Y'see, I... I guess I wasn't thinking too straight! Har! Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness because of her challenged intellect! Lotta: Now wait a minute! Karma: Continue your testimony. You were saying how it was that you saw Edgeworth? Lotta: Grr... Karma: No unnecessary comments, please. Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Phoenix: You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie! Lotta: S-says who!? Phoenix: I saw the camera you set up yesterday. It was pointed directly at the lake! You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! Leads to: \"Ooof!\" Present Lake Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie! Lotta: S-says who!? Phoenix: Take a look at this photograph. This was taken on an automatic setting, was it not? Lotta: Y-yeah, that's right. Phoenix: You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! But, as this photograph clearly shows... The camera was pointed directly at the lake! Leads to: \"Ooof!\" Lotta: When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: If there was a heavy fog, how would binoculars change that at all? Lotta: What do you mean? Phoenix: Even binoculars can't see through fog! But... you say you clearly saw him? Lotta: Er... I did... yeah. Karma: Enough! There is no room for doubt in her testimony! Phoenix: (Hmm. She sounded pretty doubtful to me! But... I have to find a clear contradiction first.) Phoenix: (I don't care how many von Karmic objections I get... I'm going to find a hole in this testimony if it's the last thing I do!) Lotta: Ooof! Judge: Mr. Wright! What are you driving at? Phoenix: The witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor! Lotta: ...! Judge: W-well then, what exactly was she photographing? Show evidence Leads to: \"Your Honor! Take a look at this...\" I don't know Phoenix: Well... that I don't know. Karma: Karma: What the witness takes photos of is entirely her business! This has nothing to do with the case! Not to mention that you can't even show us another reason why she might have been there. Mr. Wright... If you are out of material, I suggest we end this mockery of a cross-examination. Phoenix: (Uh oh... I can't let the trial end like this! I have to show them something!) Leads to: \"Your Honor! Take a look at this...\" Phoenix: Your Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake? Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Your Honor? What do you think? Judge: I... think I'm confused. Karma: Wrong again, Mr. Wright. So very wrong. You can't get through this one with your weak bluffs! Phoenix: Y-Your Honor! Enough playing around! Here's the real evidence! Judge: \"Enough playing around\" is my line, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Uh... Leads back to: \"What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?\" Phoenix: Ms. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph! Judge: What's this? A newspaper article? \"Gourdy\"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake... Phoenix: Well, Ms. Hart? Lotta: I... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this \"Gourdy.\" I don't have proof Phoenix: Well, I don't have proof... Karma: Karma: Bah! Your ineptitude is entertaining, Mr. Wright, but enough is enough! I've had enough of baseless claims made without a hair of evidence to support them! Phoenix: Phoenix: Well all right, if that's how you want to play... I'll show you evidence! Judge: Mr. Wright! Are you sure about this? Phoenix: (I'm sure sick of that smarmy prosecutor putting me down! Or... did he taunt me so I'd get mad and make a mistake?) Leads to: \"Very well, let's see it.\" I have proof Phoenix: I have it! Proof! Judge: Hmm... Intriguing! Leads to: \"Very well, let's see it.\" Judge: Very well, let's see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster! Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Phoenix: The proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera! Lotta: ...! Phoenix: You camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake. Lotta: ... Phoenix: And here, this article about \"Gourdy.\" According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren't you! That's why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises! Leads to: \"Order! Order!\" Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Phoenix: The proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster! Lotta: ...! Phoenix: According to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that's how you got this picture when the pistol fired! Leads to: \"Order! Order!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here's my proof! It's simple! Judge: ... If it's simple... then why have you obviously made an error, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Urk...? Lotta: What's that!? Karma: Go home. Consider a career change. Phoenix: (Gah! How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.) Judge: Luckily for you, I'm in a patient mood, Mr. Wright. One more time please. Leads back to: \"Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!\" Judge: Order! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange. Phoenix: (Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you? Lotta: ... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what? Phoenix: Huh...? Lotta: That don't change what I saw, does it? Karma: Exactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist! Lotta: H-hey! Karma: But, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing! Phoenix: (Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!) Judge: Ms. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony. Lotta: ... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though. Phoenix: (Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!) Karma: ... Witness Testimony -- Lotta's New Testimony -- Lotta: Actually, I'm not a research student at a university. I'm an investigative photographer. Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster! That's why I was camping out by the lake. But, that's all I was hiding. When I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake. There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time. Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot. I was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry. Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness. Karma: Karma: The witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination! Judge: Er... hmm. Phoenix: Phoenix: I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?) Judge: Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind. Karma: Hah! That would be a first! Phoenix: (Hah hah, very funny.) Judge: You understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- Lotta's New Testimony -- Lotta: Actually, I'm not a research student at a university. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then what manner of person are you!? Lotta: I'm not sure I'm high-falutin' enough to be called a \"manner\" of anything. Lotta: I'm an investigative photographer. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: An \"investigative photographer\"? Lotta: Yep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It's that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister's graduation last year... N' guess what! Phoenix: Umm... what? Lotta: There was a yoofoh just a' hanging in the sky! Phoenix: A \"yoofoh\"...? Lotta: You know, an \"Unidentified Flying Object\"? A yoofoh! That's when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer! Phoenix: I... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...) Lotta: Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is \"Gourdy\" really all that newsworthy? Lotta: Heck yeah! They even had him up on the TV! Phoenix: (I'm not sure that appearing on the local news \"rumor of the month\" show qualifies. Last month's show was \"Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill,\" I believe.) Lotta: Hey! They also had a picture of him in the newspaper! For real! Judge: Mr. Wright. This is one fight I do not believe you can win. Let's keep moving, shall we? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Lotta: That's why I was camping out by the lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That's why you put the automatic senior on your camera? Lotta: Yep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a \"bang!\"... Phoenix: It snaps a shot. Lotta: Yep. Phoenix: So, how many pictures has it taken so far? Lotta: The only time the camera triggered was that night. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Lotta: But, that's all I was hiding. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake. Lotta: Heck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake'd be swarmin' with competitors! Phoenix: Competitors...? Lotta: Yeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop! Phoenix: Ah... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth? Lotta: W-well, actually... Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! I'll not have you asking questions with no relevance to this case!!! Phoenix: (Whatever you say, von Karma. I know you told her to keep quiet.) Lotta: When I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Exactly what sort of sound was it? Lotta: Well, I never heard one before so I can't say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot. It was a lot sharper a sound than I would have expected. Phoenix: (Hmmm...) Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart!\" Lotta: There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There wasn't \"much else to look at\"? Lotta: Yep. Phoenix: (I dunno. If she heard a bang... and she thought Gourdy was out there... I kind of doubt she'd waste any time looking at a boat.) Lotta: What? What did I do now? What're you giving me that look for? Phoenix: (Definitely suspicious... Maybe it's time for some evidence...) Karma: Witness! Continue. Lotta: Hold your hushpuppies, pops, I'm getting there. Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart!\" Lotta: Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there nothing on the lake but the boat at that time? Lotta: Huh? Wait, so you're thinking maybe he was shot from some other place? I don't think so, nope. The lake was smooth as glass, and nobody was on the shore, neither. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart!\" Phoenix: (I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!) Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!? Lotta: W-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it! Phoenix: I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal! Lotta: Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!? Phoenix: You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought! Lotta: Aah! Judge: Order! Continue, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing! Lotta: ...! ... ... Phoenix: Well!? Lotta: Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all... Judge: M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then? Lotta: ... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now. Judge: ... This... this is totally uncalled for-- Lotta: B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof! Judge: Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this. Lotta: Right! Right! That's why I took this photo n'... Karma: Karma: Witness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole. Lotta: Sh-shut my what!? Phoenix: (What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...) Gumshoe: She even had a photograph to prove it. Phoenix: But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting. Gumshoe: That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\" Phoenix: (She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?) Make her show the enlargement Leads to: \"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph.\" Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (If this is a trap... I'd better hold back and see how things go. But... if I wait now, the cross-examination will be over! Can I really risk that!?) Do nothing Judge: This hereby ends the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart. Karma: And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time. Judge: Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add? Karma: I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required? Judge: Nothing, of course. Phoenix: (Oh no! I should have pressed further!) Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Game over Rethink position Phoenix: (I have to fight now or I could lose everything!) Leads to: \"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph.\" Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not? Lotta: Y-yeah! I did! Phoenix: Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!? Karma: Karma: B-because it does not exist! Lotta: What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool! Judge: What's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma! Karma: Er... erm... Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement! Karma: Karma: The prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence! Judge: Objection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court. Lotta: Here it is. Judge: Hmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence. Lake Photo added to the Court Record. Karma: Happy now, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Hmm... (There has to be something!) Karma: You asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it! Judge: Hmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination... Karma: Is over! Obviously! Judge: Then, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart. Karma: And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time. Judge: Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add? Karma: I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required? Judge: Nothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict. Phoenix: (Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?) Object to the enlargement Leads to: \"Your Honor!\" Show other evidence Phoenix: W-wait! Your Honor, This evidence... Karma: Karma: I believe we have spent enough time talking about evidence! Judge: Hmm... indeed. We've heard opinions on every piece of evidence but this enlargement. I see no point in retracing our steps. Leads back to: \"This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?\" Wait and see Phoenix: (Uh oh... think of something! No good... I guess I'll just sit back and see how this turns out.) Judge: Very well! Allow me to state my verdict. Phoenix: (Oh no! I should have pressed further!) Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Game over Phoenix: Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement! Judge: W-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is \"strange\"? Phoenix: (Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.) Present shooter's hand or pistol Phoenix: Leads to: \"Here, Your Honor!\" Present shooter Phoenix: Phoenix: Here, your honor! Judge: The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange? Can you be more specific? Phoenix: (Specific, right...) Leads back to: \"I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here, Your Honor! Judge: Where...? Mr. Wright, I understand you're in a tight spot. However! You have nothing to gain by making baseless claims of faulty evidence! Phoenix: Y-Your Honor! Never mind that... my, my finger slipped! Please let me show you again! Judge: Hmm... Leads back to: \"I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.\" Phoenix: Here, Your Honor! Judge: The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange? Phoenix: Look at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor! Judge: The hand...? Phoenix: That hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence! Judge: This man's left hand does what...!? Phoenix: Let me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts! Present Pistol Phoenix: Leads to: \"The evidence is clear.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Hmm... I'm not sure this warrants a \"take that!\" I'd better think this one through!) Judge: Mr. Wright, please hurry up. We haven't got all day. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor! Right away! Leads back to: \"I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!\" Phoenix: The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's \"right hand\"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!! Judge: Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Judge: You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim? Karma: Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!? Ms. Hart Phoenix: Who else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart! Judge: Wh-what!? Do you have proof of this!? Phoenix: (Proof-shmoof! Always with the proof! Oh... wait, I do need proof, don't I.) Judge: Mr. Wright! I'll have you remember this is a court of law! Phoenix: (Uh oh. The Judge is mad.) Karma: Let me ask again! Leads back to: \"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?\" The victim himself Leads to: \"There is only one explanation remaining!\" Larry Phoenix: (Wait, wait--I can't do that. Sacrifice one friend to save another? What's the point!?) Karma: Well, Wright! Your answer! Leads back to: \"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?\" Phoenix: There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!! Judge: Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation. Judge: Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option. Karma: Karma: I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Karma: An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot. Phoenix: The... distance? Karma: The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away! Phoenix: A meter! Th-that's three feet! Karma: There is no way it could have been suicide! Judge: Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!? Karma: Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see. Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Karma: ... Judge: That is all. The court is adjourned. December 26, 1:15 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2 Phoenix: Whew, that was a close one. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Hey! Don't you have anything to say!? Edgeworth: No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright. Phoenix: Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too! Edgeworth: ... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him! Phoenix: I was just kidding around. Edgeworth: Hmph. Phoenix: Look... I'm going to go check on Maya. Edgeworth: Oh... Wright. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Tell her something for me. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: ... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all. Phoenix: (Would it kill you to just state how you really feel with a \"thanks\", Edgeworth?) (Changed from [Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!] in the original release) Phoenix: I requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the \"bang\" she heard. Lotta's Deposition added to the Court Record. To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

I'm glad Mr. Edgeworth made it through the day okay. It's a relief... Phoenix: Hey. Why'd you do that, anyway? Maya: ... I don't know. I... just knew I had to do something. I know I'm not the lawyer my sister was... ... I'm sorry. Phoenix: Well, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay? Maya: O... Okay. Talk Questioning Phoenix: Have you been questioned yet? Maya: No... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said \"seeing as this is your first offense, we'll let you go after questioning.\" Phoenix: Whew... Maya: Oh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay? Phoenix: Huh? How much? Maya: I don't know. I guess they'll send you a bill or something. Phoenix: (Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word \"bail\"?) Mia Phoenix: Any luck with Mia...? Maya: None... I can't get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don't know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn't have stopped my training. Phoenix: (Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...) Maya: I wonder if I'll ever see my sister again... Present Attorney's Badge Maya: It must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say \"I'm a lawyer!\" But, spirit mediums, well... Phoenix: I dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you... Maya: But these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I'll ever be a proper medium... Lake Photo Maya: Isn't that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about? Phoenix: Uh huh. Maya: Huh... It's nice and big... but you can't really see the faces any clearer, can you? Misty Fey's Photo Maya: My... mother. ... Phoenix: (Now that I've shown her the picture, I'm not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I'm pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.) Gourdy Article Maya: I want to see Gourdy, too! Phoenix: If he really exists. Maya: Well, I'd say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let's get some fishing poles and go down to the lake! Phoenix: (Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...) Pistol Bullet Maya: So the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched? Phoenix: Hey, I'm surprised you remembered that! Maya: How could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings? Phoenix: I'm... not really sure. Pistol Maya: Mr. Edgeworth's prints are on this pistol, aren't they? Phoenix: Yes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting. Maya: What? Really!? Phoenix: (The shooter used his left hand, after all...) Anything else Maya: Sorry... I'm fresh out of ideas. December 26Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: ...

Police: Gumshoe's at the scene again today. Phoenix: Huh? Oh, really? Police: He's a live wire that one. Got into a fight with the chief for not following protocol... Phoenix: (Not following protocol...? I bet he wouldn't help them build the case against Edgeworth...) Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"Don't do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: Wha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don't believe it! Phoenix: (He must be playing chess on the computer...) December 26Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: Apparently, Mr. Grossberg is on vacation today. Well, I guess I can come back tomorrow if I need anything. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read. Desk Phoenix: A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster. Vacant wall Phoenix: I guess Mr. Grossberg isn't getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him... Potted plant Phoenix: An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available. Table Phoenix: A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn. December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrance Phoenix: There are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today? Examine Trees Phoenix: I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a \"nature park.\" It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold. Sign Phoenix: The sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though. December 26Gourd LakePublic Beach Phoenix: Haven't seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance... Examine Lake Phoenix: The famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It's a pretty big lake, really. December 26Boat Rental Shop Phoenix: (Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.) Examine Shop Phoenix: A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder. Boats Phoenix: There are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock. December 26Gourd Lake Woods Phoenix: Hey, Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ... Phoenix: Yes? What about the trial? Gumshoe: Well, I was going to say \"good show,\" but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know? Phoenix: Er... thanks. Examine Camera Phoenix: Lotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen. Sign Phoenix: The sign says \"No Camping.\" Funny place to pick to pitch your tent. Campfire Phoenix: I wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit. SUV Phoenix: I don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here. Talk Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow? Gumshoe: It sounds like he's bringing in another witness! Phoenix: Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today... Karma: There were two witnesses! Phoenix: I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it? Gumshoe: S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information. Phoenix: (Right...) Prosecutor Edgeworth Phoenix: Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth. Gumshoe: What's up? Phoenix: Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before. Gumshoe: ... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident? Gumshoe: Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes. Maya Fey Phoenix: I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey... Gumshoe: Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release) Phoenix: Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?) Gumshoe: He was really grateful for what she did, you know. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: I think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal! Lotta's Camera Gumshoe: That woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all... Phoenix: Still, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today. Gumshoe: Oh, huh, really? Phoenix: (Umm... you were at the trial, weren't you, Detective?) Robert's Autopsy Report Gumshoe: Robert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager. Lake Photo Gumshoe: I don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all! Phoenix: But Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat. Gumshoe: Then he's the one being shot, then! Phoenix: He seemed fine in court today... Gumshoe: ... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway? Phoenix: (All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...) Pistol Bullet Gumshoe: Yep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt. Phoenix: From a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat. Gumshoe: Hmm... Phoenix: What do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Hey, making something of things is your job! Phoenix: Er... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?) Pistol Gumshoe: Maybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal. Phoenix: Huh? How should I know!? Lotta's Deposition Gumshoe: Now, she heard two gunshots, right? Phoenix: But wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times! Gumshoe: What!? How's that possible!? Phoenix: Where was the third shot fired? Gumshoe: I wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something? Anything else Gumshoe: Sorry to disappoint you, pal. I'm drawing a blank. After clearing all Talk options: Gumshoe: I'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can. Phoenix: Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be? Gumshoe: Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth...? Gumshoe: Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay? Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month's rent, too...) After clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake Woods: December 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: Hey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I'm free to go. Phoenix: Free at last, eh? Maya: Those interrogators were really mean! They were like \"okay, what did you do THIS time?\" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it? Phoenix: Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they? Maya: Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail. Phoenix: Thank Edgeworth. Maya: Huh? Phoenix: He posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did. Maya: Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick! Talk What to do Phoenix: What do you think we should do next? Maya: We're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy. Phoenix: ... Maya: I-I was kidding! Phoenix: Still, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there? Maya: Sure! Any ideas Phoenix: Have you noticed anything lately? Maya: Hmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean. Phoenix: I meant have you noticed anything about the case...? Maya: Well... Not much more than that, no. Phoenix: (She's probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.) Wright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great. Phoenix: Behave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay? Maya: Heh heh heh. Misbehaving's much more fun. Phoenix: It's not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again. Maya: ... Right. I'll behave. Phoenix: (Oh dear...) Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: I don't know! I've been in detention this whole time. I think I'll let you decide what we should do. Deal? Any ideas Phoenix: Well? Any thoughts you want to share? Maya: Well, I was detention all day. I think I'd like more time to think. Phoenix: (Poor Maya, she probably thought about Mia the whole time she was in there...) Present Anything Maya: Don't waste time showing me things! We have to get cracking on this case! You know the enemy has more tricks up his sleeve! He's bringing in another witness! December 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like Edgeworth is in questioning. Maya: Let's come back later. Phoenix: Guess so... December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrance Maya: There aren't many cops around today, are there? Phoenix: They're probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth. Maya: Mmm... Lotta: Hey y'all! Maya: Hey, it's Lotta! Lotta: Y'all really did it today... Phoenix: Wh-what did we do now? Lotta: Naw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind. Phoenix: Lotta... Lotta: So, you see, I want to make it up to y'all. Phoenix: \"Make it up\"...? Talk Today's trial Phoenix: What did you think of the trial? Lotta: To be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble. Maya: Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing. Lotta: Yeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder! Maya: Right! Phoenix: (You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...) Gourdy Phoenix: What about Gourdy? Lotta: Right! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom! Maya: All right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too! Phoenix: (Finish your spirit medium training first!) Making it up Phoenix: Lotta, what do you mean by \"making it up to us\"? Lotta: Well, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you. Maya: What!? Lotta: That von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it. Maya: Wh-what information!? Lotta: Now we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little \"exchange.\" Phoenix: E-\"exchange\"? Umm... I thought this was to \"make it up to us\"...? Lotta: Right! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you! Phoenix: ... Lotta: What!? Information don't come cheap, my friend! Maya: Uh... Lotta: Hey! I see you thinking \"my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are\"!!! It's written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I'm just the exception, okay? Well, what'll it be? We gonna deal, or not!? Maya: Wh-what should we do, Nick? Deal Phoenix: (We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much? Lotta: Huh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I'm not trying to rob the poor! Leads to: \"Huh?\" No deal Phoenix: I'm sorry... But I've no intention of dealing with you! Maya: Nor do we have any money, anyway! Lotta: You guys make a fine team, you know that? And I can tell you don't have any money, just look at those clothes! Leads to: \"Huh?\" Present Lotta's Camera Lotta: I'm thinking I should up the sensitivity of my camera mic. Y'all just be sure y'all don't sneeze or nothing when you're in my part of the woods! Phoenix: Right... Lake Photo Lotta: I'm glad I did that enlargement. Phoenix: No kidding. If we didn't have that, Edgeworth would be in prison now, or worse! Maya: There's never a lack of drama when you're on a case, is there, Nick? Lotta: What, are you always on the verge of horrible failure like this!? Phoenix: Umm... Lotta: Careful or the stress'll send you to an early grave. Phoenix: (Thanks for the cheerful message of support!) Gourdy Article Maya: Umm... uh... You know, I was wondering... Lotta: Yeah? Maya: What if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did? Lotta: Y'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn't make a hit story! I need a picture that screams \"I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!\" I can't turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y'all think I am? Phoenix: (The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn't see!) Anything else Lotta: Yep, I'd have to say I know exactly squat about that. Phoenix: (It's painfully easy to know when something doesn't catch Lotta's interest...) Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: The only fair exchange for information is... information! Listen good-- What I need from you is information about Gourdy! Maya: Whoa-whoa-whoa! G-Gourdy!? Phoenix: B-but Gourdy doesn't... I mean, Gourdy might not exist! Lotta: Then bring me proof that shows he don't! Phoenix: Uh... Lotta: I'll be keepin' watch from the car, okay? You see something, y'all come to me first, got it? Phoenix: O-okay... Lotta: Right! See y'all later! Phoenix: ... Maya: Okay, Nick, let's get hunting! Phoenix: H-hunting...? You don't seriously mean... Maya: Gourdy? I sure do! Phoenix: What about Edgeworth!? Maya: We're searching for Gourdy for him, Nick! Don't you get it!? Phoenix: (Okay... and how exactly do we search for a make-believe monster...? Maybe we can find a monster myth specialist?) December 26Gourd LakePublic Beach Phoenix: Wh-what's that? Maya: Th-the Steel Samurai, Nick. Butz: Yo! Maya! Phoenix: Larry! What the heck is that!? (Changed from [Larry! What the heck is this!?] in the original release) Butz: Oh, it was my girl Kiyance's idea... She was all \"if you like, put this here, it would be, like, really cool!\" Dude, she gave it to me along with the banner! Maya: Wow! That's really impressive she could find those for you! Butz: Well, she knows a lot of people. And that show's finished now, so she got 'em for free. Phoenix: Right... Examine Flags Phoenix: Those flags look sadly out of place here. Flapping listlessly back and forth in a cold wind under a cold sky... Maya: I dunno, I think it kind of gives the place a festival atmosphere. It reminds me of the \"War of the Eyeglasses\"! Phoenix: ...? The war of the what!? Maya: Huh? What? You mean, you don't know the War of the Eyeglasses? Phoenix: What the heck is it? Maya: Our local fair used to do it ever summer... Huh, I guess we were the only ones. Phoenix: (I ask again, what the heck is it!?) Steel Samurai inflatable Phoenix: Doesn't that Steel Samurai look a little out of place? I mean, it's so huge... I guess it's good advertising. Maya: ... Something about this Steel Samurai just doesn't work for me. Phoenix: Huh? Really? It looks pretty well made to me. Maya: Hmph. Still a novice, aren't you, Nick. Really... True connoisseurs like Cody and me don't fall for this kind of stuff. Phoenix: (These Steel Samurai fans are obviously in a league of their own...) Compressor Maya: What's this machine? Butz: That? That's a compressor. I use it to fill up that balloon there with air. Maya: Huh, neat. Butz: Just got it repaired yesterday! Man, what a drag that was. Talk Edgeworth Butz: Yo, Nick! What happened with Edgeworth? Phoenix: Well, we made it through the first day in court all right... I don't know how good our prospects are from here on, though. Butz: Huh. Maya: Hey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth's secret weakness? He's terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy! Butz: Huh? That's weird. I don't think he was ever like that in school. Maya: No? Really? Butz: Well, we were only in the same class for a year. He transferred schools pretty quickly... Maya: Transferred? Phoenix: (Right... when the DL-6 Incident happened. Doesn't look like Larry knows about it, though.) The big samurai Phoenix: Hey, Larry. What was that big... thing up there before? Butz: Huh? Oh, the big guy? I've had that for about a month, yeah. It's a big hit with the kids! Phoenix: Why wasn't it there yesterday? Butz: Huh? Huh!? Oh... right. Th-the compressor was busted. Maya: Compressor? Butz: Yeah--it's that little unit by my hotdog stand. That what I use to put air in the Steel Samurai! It broke a little while ago so I sent it in for repairs. Maya: Oh. And here I thought you'd inflated it by yourself. Present Gourdy Article Butz: That's the guy that\u2019s selling my dogs faster than I can cook 'em! Maya: Do you think Gourdy really exists? Butz: Nah, I think somebody probably saw something else that they just thought was Gourdy. But I'll keep selling Samurai Dogs until the truth's out! Anything else Butz: Sorry, Nick. I don't know much about that. I am a mere seller of hotdogs. December 26Boat Rental Shop Maya: ... It\u2019s always so quiet, here. I wonder if the boat shop is closed for good? Phoenix: Well, with the murder on the lake and all... They're probably just taking a vacation till it blows over. Maya: I get it. After clearing \"Making it up\" talk option in Gourd Lake Park - Entrance: December 26Gourd Lake Woods Lotta: Hey y'all! Well? Y'all find anything out about Gourdy? Maya: Umm... no, nothing. Lotta: Well, keep moving! It gets cold out here at nighttime. Maya: It is a little chilly... I... I think I have to sneeze! Lotta: Wh-whoa! No you don't! No sneezing!!! Maya: Whaaa-cho! klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik Maya: ... Lotta: I told y'all NO SNEEZING! See, I set the camera to respond to things a little softer than a \"bang.\" It'd trigger on one of von Karma's finger snaps now! Maya: Oh... I'm sorry. Lotta: Yeah, well, sorry's nice but what about my film!? Maya: Nick... pay the lady. Phoenix: (*sob*) Talk What happened Lotta: I learned something in today's trial, that's for sure. Testifyin' is serious business! That's why I decided not to talk about that case any more. Maya: Huh? Phoenix: Whoa--didn't you say you had information about the case!? Tell us that, at least! Lotta: Like I said... I'll trade it for the dirt on Gourdy! Gourdy Maya: What are you going to do if Gourdy doesn't exist? Lotta: I'll quit being an investigative photographer. Maya: What!? Lotta: After all, I only have one photo to my name so far... Maya: Was it a good one? Lotta: You bet... a yoofoh! Maya: A y-yoofoh...? Lotta: Anyway, if I can't get a career-making photo this time around... Then that's it! I'll quit and go back to school. Maya: Huh? So you really are a university student? Lotta: Yeah, well, I'm takin' a break for a bit. Maya: Right... Present Lotta's Camera Lotta: I gotta do what I gotta do to get me a picture of Gourdy! That's why I raised the sensitivity of my mic. Just... watch yourself from now on, okay? Maya: Sorry, sorry! December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Gumshoe: Hey there, pal. What's up? You look out of sorts. Wait... you didn't go and do something that's going to hurt Mr. Edgeworth's case again! Phoenix: What do you mean, \"again\"!? Gumshoe: Whatever, have a seat, pal. I'm here for you if you need anything. Besides money, that is. Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"You're under arrest! I have a warrant... You have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney...\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for making arrests. Talk The investigation Phoenix: How is the investigation proceeding? Gumshoe: It's not, really. We have another meeting coming up... We're supposed to talk about Mr. Edgeworth's motive... Maya: His motive? Gumshoe: See, Mr. Edgeworth's father died in the DL-6 Incident... And the guy who got the lone suspect declared innocent was the victim in this case... Robert Hammond. They're saying that's why Mr. Edgeworth shot him. Phoenix: (And Edgeworth never talks about his past... I bet they'll drag that out and hit him with it in court tomorrow, too...) Maya: Poor Edgeworth... Gumshoe: I gotta admit, it doesn't look good, pal. Gourdy Maya: Say, Detective Gumshoe. Do you know \"Gourdy\"? Gumshoe: The monster down in Gourd Lake? Not personally, no. Maya: Well... we're looking for it. (Changed from [Well... we're looking for him.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Huh!? Are you out of your minds!? Maya: Eeek! Gumshoe: You got time to go wild monster hunting!? How about doing a little questioning for me then!? Maya: Oh... Detective Gumshoe is scaring me, Nick. Phoenix: I told Detective Gumshoe about the deal with Lotta. Maya: Nick! Try telling him sooner next time! Phoenix: Er, sorry. Gumshoe: ... I see, pal. Sorry for shoutin' at you. ... Okay! I, Detective Gumshoe, will aid your search for Gourdy! Maya: H-huh!? Gumshoe: I'll loan you one of our newest secret weapons for finding evidence! Maya: Really!?

First, let me show 'em to you! These are our best and brightest! Introducing Secret Weapon No. 1: \"Missile\"! Maya: M-M-Missile? Gumshoe: He's a K-9 police dog, still in training! Missile! Missile! Here, boy... Missile: Woof. Gumshoe: Here he is. Maya: Hey, he's cute! Look, Nick! Cute dog! Phoenix: (A cute dog... And this will help us... how?) Missile: Woof. Gumshoe: Next, Secret Weapon No. 2... A fishing pole! Here, this is my own personal pole. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for a monster... Gumshoe: Yeah! Phoenix: How are we supposed to catch a whole sea monster with a fishing pole!? Gumshoe: Never know 'til you try, pal! Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: Okay, this next one is the last one. Phoenix: (No, please, I'm already overwhelmed by our choices.) Gumshoe: Secret Weapon No. 3! A metal detector! Here. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for something alive. Gumshoe: Right! Phoenix: How are we supposed to find it with a metal detector!? Gumshoe: Hey, you never know! It might have been eating soda cans! Well, which will it be!? Maya: Umm... I can't make up my mind, Nick. They all seem so perfect! Phoenix: I can't make up my mind, either... for the totally opposite reason. (Oh well, I suppose it can't hurt to borrow one of them.) Borrow Missile Phoenix: Can we borrow Missile? Gumshoe: Sure thing, pal. Be good to 'im! Missile: Woof. Maya: He's sooooo cute! Phoenix: (Oh boy...) Borrowed K-9 unit Missile from Detective Gumshoe.

But I hear he's aptly-named, for what it's worth. Fishing Pole Gumshoe: It's funny, one day I woke up and I wanted a fishing pole. Maya: Do you like fishing? Gumshoe: I've never gone. I just wanted one so bad, I went out and bought it. I've never used it, actually. Phoenix: (Must have been one of those mid-life crisis things...) Metal Detector Gumshoe: As you can see, it's a metal detector. We use it to look for bullets in the ground. If you can find that monster with it, all the better! Phoenix: (I'm not so hopeful...) Gourd Lake Public Beach If Missile is added to the Court Record Maya: Hey, Nick... Phoenix: Hmm? Maya: Missile's been acting strangely... Phoenix: \"Missile\"? Oh, oh right.

(It's going to have to this time...) Present Missile Maya: Hey Larry! Look, it's Missile! Isn't he cute? Butz: K-keep that mutt away from me! What am I going to tell the big boss? Maya: There's a \"big boss\" in charge of your hot dog stand? Nick! Maybe the stand is a front for a mafia money laundering scheme!!! Phoenix: Maya... I think you should probably try to look a little sorry about what happened. Maya: Oh, right! Butz: Heh... My poor dogs... Fishing Pole Butz: You know, you can't catch many fish in this lake. Maya: I'm not after small fry. I'm after the biggest fry of them all... Gourdy! Butz: ... You really going to try to fish out a monster? Maya: To save Edgeworth, yes! Butz: ... Brings a tear to my eye, in more ways than one. Gourd Lake Woods If Fishing Pole is added to the Court Record Maya: Mmm. Okay, Nick, this looks like a good spot! Phoenix: A good spot... for what? Maya: Time to do some fishing! Phoenix: (She's serious...) Umm... What are you going to use for bait? Maya: Oh... Phoenix: Yeah. \"Oh.\" Maya: Mmm... Phoenix: I figured something like this would happen. We should have brought Missile along with us, too. At least then we'd have bait. Maya: ...!!! N-Nick...! How could you! Phoenix: I'm kidding! I'm kidding! Maya: Hmph! Some jokes are better left untold. Phoenix: (Oof! She hit me!) Maya: Okay... Watch this, Nick! Phoenix: Just try not to reel in any empty cans or boots, okay?

Lotta: Don't tell me y'all are on some film company's payroll! Maya: Nick, pay her. Phoenix: (Dear, dear...) Present Missile Maya: Hey, Lotta! Lotta: Oh, cute! He yours? Maya: He's a K-9 police dog! His name's \"Missile.\" Lotta: Huh. K-9s are the ones they use to sniff for things, right? I wonder what Gourdy smells like... Maya: Hmm... I hadn't thought about that. Fishing Pole Maya: Lotta, wait... For catching Gourdy... Lotta: A fishing pole!? Are you out of your doggone mind!? Maya: Yes! I mean... yes, it's a fishing pole! Lotta: Huh. I never thought of that! Good luck! Maya: Thanks! Phoenix: (I don't believe it...) Metal Detector Maya: Hey, Lotta, look at this: It's a metal detector! Lotta: I know what it is. Umm... I'm not sure that's going to pick up Gourdy, though. Unless he's been eating people's watches or spare change or something. Maya: Oh... I hadn't thought about that. Boat Rental Shop If Metal Detector is added to the Court Record *beep* *beep* *beep* Maya: N-Nick! It's beeping! The metal detector's found something! Phoenix: Sure it loud enough about it. (Whatever it is, it must be in those bushes...) Go check it out, Maya. Maya: Why do I have to check it out? ... Nick. Look! Phoenix: Huh...? An air tank? Huh. The valve looks broken. Maya: I thought it was Gourdy... Phoenix: Maya, first of all... Why would Gourdy be in the bushes!? And second of all, why would a metal detector react to a sea monster!? Maya: Oh. Phoenix: Huh? (There's something wrapped around this air tank... It looks like... a string of flags...?) Maya: Well, we might as well take it with us now that we've found it. Phoenix: (It's heavy...) Air Tank of dubious value retrieved. (Changed from [Picked up air tank of dubious value.] in the original release) After Air Tank is added to the Court Record: December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Phoenix: Hmm... Detective Gumshoe isn't here... Maya: Now that you mention it, didn't he say he had a meeting to go to? Phoenix: Ah, that's right... Let's come back later. Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"Resistance is futile! We have you surrounded! It's not too late... Release the hostages and come out with your hands up.\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for negotiating a hostage situation. Gourd Lake Public Beach Talk The flying air tank (after selecting \"Is it yours?\", then \"To inflate something\", then \"Ask more about the tank\" upon presenting Air Tank) Maya: Umm... So, the tank and the Steel Samurai you were trying to fill up flew away... What happened next? Butz: Well, all that happened on the 20th or so. Phoenix: (The 20th... a week ago.) Butz: Now, as far as I could see, the tank went flying out into the lake. So I went out every night in a boat looking for it. I mean, Kiyance gave me that Steel Samurai after all! Maya: And when did you find it? Butz: Just the night before last! It flew way out there! Took me four whole days to find it. Phoenix: (The night before last... was the night of the murder!) Butz: Sorry for not telling you, Nick. Actually, I was here on the night of the murder. But, you see, I went home before midnight. Maya: So you didn't know about what happened? Butz: No... Maya: That's too bad... Phoenix: It's not all bad. We've solved one mystery at least. Maya: A mystery...? Phoenix: (Maybe we should go tell her...) Present Air Tank Butz: What? An air tank? What about it? Phoenix: Larry... I wanted to ask you about this tank... Have you seen it before? Phoenix: Have you seen this before? Butz: Huh? Me? N-no. Never. Who the heck would go diving in the middle of the winter! Phoenix: (There's something about the way his eye twitched when I showed him the tank... I think I'd better pursue this line of questioning a little further...) Leads back to Court Record Is it yours? Phoenix: Say... is this air tank yours? Butz: Wh-why would I have a thing like that? Phoenix: Look--see how there's a string of flags around the tank valve? It's just like the string of flags around your Steel Samurai there. Butz: ...! M-must be a coincidence! There's strings of flags everywhere these days! L-like elementary schools! A-and used car dealerships! L-look, why would I need a tank anyway!? To inflate something Phoenix: You used this to inflate that, didn't you? Butz: I-inflate what!? Phoenix: What else? That big puffy Steel Samurai! Butz: !!! ... N-now why would you go asking me a question like that. Phoenix: (Looks like I hit the nail on the head.) Butz: ... Right... right... Actually, umm... See, the compressor I always use was on the fritz. So I tried using the tank to inflate it, just once. And, er, it didn't go so well. Phoenix: (As I suspected!) Put the tank away Phoenix: (I guess I've gotten to the bottom of that mystery!) Butz: Heh. Sorry! Leads back to Court Record Ask more about the tank Phoenix: It \"didn't go so well\"? Butz: Er, yeah. Phoenix: Do you think you could be a little more specific? Butz: C-c'mon...  Look, it's embarrassing so I really don't want to talk about it... Maya: Tell us! Tell us! Butz: ... Fine. Whatever. It's like what I said, the compressor was busted. So I took the tank and tried to fill the Samurai up with that. And then... BLAAAAM! Butz: The valve busted open and made this incredible noise! And that tank there took off like a rocket. And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it! Maya: What!? Off into Gourd Lake? Butz: It sure scared me out of my gourd, that's for sure. Adds Talk option \"The flying air tank\" To go diving Phoenix: You used this to go diving in the lake, didn't you? Butz: Wh-wh-what!? Why the heck would I go diving in the lake!? Wait! You... you're not... You're not saying I had something to do with that murder!? Phoenix: N-no, not at all, just... Butz: Hey, you watch it buddy! I'm not saying anything until my lawyer gets here! Maya: Larry... Nick is your lawyer. Phoenix: Well, Larry? She's right. Butz: Bah! A-anyway, I never seen that air tank! Okay? Phoenix: (Yeah, right... Larry is hiding something, I can tell...) Leads back to Court Record Air Tank (after selecting \"Is it yours?\", then \"To inflate something\", then \"Ask more about the tank\" upon presenting Air Tank) Butz: See, I tried to use this tank to fill up the Samurai. I was attaching the tank, when it happened! BLAAAAM! Butz: The valve just busted open and the whole thing took off! The tank shot up in the air like a rocket... And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it! Man, what a sight that was. Maya: I wish I could have seen it! Phoenix: Me too. Gourd Lake Woods Talk Gourdy Lotta: Well, Mister Lawyer? I've got the info y'all need! Y'all got the scoop on Gourdy for me yet? Nothing yet Phoenix: It's not going to be that easy to find him, you know. Lotta: You'd better hurry or you won't have that info in time for the trial tomorrow! Phoenix: (Uh oh...) Leads back to Talk options We found him Phoenix: Huh? Gourdy? Oh, we found him already. Maya: What!? I haven't seen any monsters yet! Lotta: Y-y'all for real!? Gourdy really exists!? Wait! I need proof! You get a photo!? I have proof Phoenix: Of course I have proof. Maya: No fair, Nick! It was when I went to the bathroom, wasn't it!? That's when you made contact with Gourdy! Lotta: Enough jabbering already, let's see your proof! Present Air Tank (after clearing \"The flying air tank\" Talk option in Gourd Lake - Public Beach) Phoenix: Maya: Larry's air tank...? Lotta: What're y'all doing with an air tank? Phoenix: This... is Gourdy. Lotta: Umm... scuze me? Maya: Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick? Phoenix: There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud \"bang\" when it flew... Lotta: A \"bang\"...? Phoenix: The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo! Maya: Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!? Lotta: ... ... Well, that's a fine way to ruin a gal's dreams. Phoenix: I'm sorry, Lotta. Lotta: Nah, it's okay, you win. I'll give you your info, like I promised. Maya: Poor Lotta... Adds \"Case information\" Talk option Present anything else Phoenix: Lotta: ... Y'all trying to make a fool out of me? That don't prove diddly-squat! Maya: Hmph. We almost had her duped, too. Phoenix: (We need to do something soon or I won't get that information off of her!) Leads back to Talk options I have no proof Phoenix: I don't have it yet, but my lawyer instincts tell me the proof is out there. Lotta: Hah! Nice try, but y'all can't pull the wool over these eyes that easy! Maya: That won't work in court either, Nick... Phoenix: (Great, now they're both mad at me.) Leads back to Talk options Gourdy doesn't exist Phoenix: Lotta... There is no such thing as Gourdy. Lotta: Wh-what!? How can y'all be so sure! Maya: R-really, Nick!? Lotta: Y'all got some proof Gourdy don't exist!? Phoenix: The proof that Gourdy doesn't exist... Is here Phoenix: Of course I have proof. No lawyer worth his badge would make a claim without proof to back it up. Here's the proof that Gourdy doesn't exist... Present Air Tank (after clearing \"The flying air tank\" Talk option in Gourd Lake - Public Beach) Phoenix: Maya: Larry's air tank...? Lotta: What're y'all doing with an air tank?

Adds \"Case information\" Talk option Present anything else Phoenix: Lotta: ... Hah! All that fancy talk about lawyers and proof had me going for a second there! Y'all better take a good hard look at that badge of yours and consider a career change! Phoenix: (Great, the \"investigative photographer\" is giving me career advice...) Leads back to Talk options Is out there somewhere Phoenix: I don't have it yet, but my lawyer instincts tell me the proof is out there. Lotta: Hah!

Leads back to Talk options Case information (appears after correctly presenting Air Tank upon selecting \"Gourdy\" Talk option) Leads to: \"So, tell us this \"information\" you have.\" Phoenix: So, tell us this \"information\" you have. Lotta: A promise is a promise, I guess... I overheard the cops around here saying something about the witness tomorrow... They said he's the caretaker of the boat rental place up the path here. Maya: Boat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted. Lotta: Just an old guy, living all by himself. Y'all should go check it out. Maya: Thanks, Lotta! We will! Let's get cracking, Nick! Lotta: Hold on. Phoenix: Something else? Lotta: Yeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know. Maya: ...! Wait... so you have another photo? Lotta: Well... Yeah, but there's nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn't be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it. Second Lake Photo added to the Court Record. Lotta: Bye now. Y'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave. Maya: ... Poor Lotta... Phoenix: It's all Larry's fault. The legend still lives on, I guess. Maya: The \"legend\"...? Phoenix: Yeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" Maya: Hmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape. December 26Boat Rental Shop Maya: Hey, Nick! This is the boat shop that Lotta was talking about! Phoenix: You're right. Doesn't seem to be anyone around at all. Maya: Well, let's go check it out anyway! December 26Caretaker's Shack Uncle: Meg! That you!? Maya: Eeeek! Uncle: Hey, is that Keith with you!? Where have you two been! I've been worried sick. Maya: ... N-Nick... you handle this. Phoenix: Uh, I think I'll leave this one up to you, Maya. Uncle: Meg! Maya: Y-yes!? Uncle: Finally made up your mind, have you? Meg: M-my mind? Uncle: You'll run the pasta shop when I'm gone? Maya: P-pasta? Uncle: Glad to hear it, glad to hear it! You make your old man proud. When you kids left the house, I didn't know what to think. How'm I supposed to keep this place running, an old man like me? Polly! The kids are home! Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Maya: N-Nick! What was that!? Phoenix: A parrot... the one on the perch. Uncle: Keith! Phoenix: Y-yes!? Uncle: I leave the \"Wet Noodle\" in your capable hands, sonny. Maya: N-Nick? What's the \"Wet Noodle\"? Phoenix: Um, based on the available evidence, I'd say it's the name of his pasta shop. Uncle: That's a relief, isn't it, Polly? Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Uncle: Ayup... ... *Zzzzz* Maya: He fell asleep... Phoenix: I guess he's relieved. Examine Stove Phoenix: Looks like a kitchen unit. It's pretty clean. Funny, he doesn't look like the type who'd keep things tidy like that. Maya: You're forgetting, Nick... He's running a pasta shop, here! Fish pictures Phoenix: Wow, there's lots of various fish in Gourd Lake, aren't there! Maya: ...? Something's funny, Nick. All these fish are saltwater fish. Fishing pole Phoenix: This fishing pole looks expensive. Table Maya: Look, Nick, he has an electric blanket on his table! Looks warm! That's a great idea, we should do that at the office. We can sit down with our clients, snug and warm, and drink hot cocoa! Phoenix: And what, talk about murders? Maya: Aw, you're a party pooper, Nick! Television Maya: Wow, he has a television in here, too. Safe Maya: Look, a little safe! Hmm... ... It's locked. Parrot Maya: Wow... what an amazing parrot that is. Good morning!

Everybody knows that. Maya: Nick...? Phoenix: Huh? Maya: How long do we have to keep up this all-in-the-family charade? Phoenix: (This old man must know something about the murder...!

This here's the palace of pasta, the \"Wet Noodle\"! Though, now that you mention it, we haven't gotten many orders for spaghetti lately. All the kids come up and say \"Yo dude, we wanna ride in one of your boats!\" That's why I keep them boats out there. Youngsters these days... Darned if I understand 'em!

Phoenix: (It was after midnight, but okay...) Uncle: Then I heard this \"bang!\" So I looked outside. Then I heard another one. \"Bang!\" A little while later, this boat comes back. Then a young man walked by my window here. He was mutterin' something to himself, ayup. Maya: What did he say? Uncle: ... Ayup... ... I forgot. I'll remember tomorrow by court time, promise.

But, on one condition. Maya: What's that? Uncle: When this case is over and done... You'll run the \"Wet Noodle\"! Promise to run the Noodle Leads to: \"Okay, we promise.\" We can't promise that Phoenix: I can't make that promise. Uncle: ... I-is that any way to treat your old man!? Bah! You want me help? You've come to the wrong man! Maya: Uh oh... now he's grumpy. Phoenix: Not to mention he still thinks we're his kids. (Maybe we should just lie and say we'll run his shop?) Leads to: \"Okay, we promise.\" Phoenix: Okay, we promise. Maya: N-Nick! Are you sure about this? Phoenix: Hey, anything to get the case solved. Also... Who wouldn't want to eat \"Phoenix Noodles\"?

Uncle: He comes up and tells me to come down to court tomorrow. Maya: Really...? Phoenix: (Somehow I don't think we're going to get much useful information out of this guy.) Maya... maybe we should be leaving. Maya: I think you're right. Oh, wait--I had one more question. Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something? Parrot: *squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Maya: H-huh!? What did she just say, Nick? Phoenix: One more time, Polly! Parrot: \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Phoenix: (What!? The DL-6 Incident?) Hey, mister! I-I mean, Dad! Uncle: *Zzzzz* Phoenix: (This is getting weird... Who IS this old guy!?) Boat Rental Shop Maya: Why would that bird Polly know about DL-6...? Phoenix: We have to figure out who that old man is. Maya: Oh... Phoenix: What? Maya: He locked the door, from the other side. Phoenix: (... Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this DL-6 Incident... Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe.) After clearing \"Polly\" and \"What you saw\" Talk options in Caretaker's Shack: December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Gumshoe: Hey, pal! Long time no see! ... You don't look so happy. What's wrong this time? Phoenix: Actually, we wanted to ask you something... Gumshoe: Yeah? Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"I... I'm not gonna make it... Just... just arrest that guy for me... please... uggh!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for dying in action. Talk The boat caretaker Phoenix: You know the boat rental shop down at Gourd Lake? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah... Phoenix: The old man who runs it is appearing as a witness in court tomorrow, right? Gumshoe: Huh...!? How'd you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret. Maya: Do you know who that old man is, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Actually... I don't. He's a bit of an odd bird... I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn't persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That's why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea. Maya: Hmm... sounds suspicious! Gumshoe: Hmm... The DL-6 Incident Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, please, help us... Gumshoe: H-huh? Phoenix: We need to know about the DL-6 Incident! Gumshoe: ...! Phoenix: That was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case. Gumshoe: ... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal. Maya: What!? Gumshoe: However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up. Present Metal Detector Phoenix: Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. This was really helpful. Gumshoe: R-really? Maya: You seem surprised! Gumshoe: Huh? N-no, not at all. Glad it worked out for you. Parrot Gumshoe: What's that? A parrot? Phoenix: The old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that \"incident\"... Gumshoe: That incident? Phoenix: DL-6. Gumshoe: Wh-what!? Maya: Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something? Parrot: *squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Maya: H-huh!? Phoenix: I'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word... Gumshoe: Yeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident? Phoenix: Wait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6? Maya: N-Nick! You think he might be!? Gumshoe: ... After clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot: Gumshoe: ... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need. Maya: All right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room! Phoenix: (I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...) December 26Police DepartmentRecords Room Maya: Wow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty. Phoenix: Ten years of files and ten years of dust, I guess. Maya: Let's find that DL-6 stuff quick! Phoenix: (Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?) Maya: Nick! I found out where the file is! Phoenix: O-oh, thanks! Maya: Just let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file! Examine Glass case Phoenix: It looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside. Maya: Nick... it's locked. Phoenix: They must keep important case files in there. Back wall Phoenix: There are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity... Maya: Nick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me! Cabinet Phoenix: This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk. Maya: Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for? Phoenix: Don't touch that! It's evidence... Shelves Phoenix: Here are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here. Maya: Wow... these are all case reports!? Phoenix: Yeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases. Maya: I guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust. Talk The case summary Phoenix: Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary. Maya: Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go. Phoenix: December 28... 2001. Maya: That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow! Phoenix: (So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release) Maya: What!? Is this the same district courthouse where we're holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?] in the original release) Phoenix: Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out. Maya: Wow... that was some earthquake! Phoenix: At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours! Maya: That would be scary like that, in the dark! Phoenix: There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious. Maya: The survivors...? Phoenix: One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart. Maya: That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it. Phoenix: (He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.) Victim data Phoenix: Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father? Maya: Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it! Phoenix: Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles. Maya: \"Miles\"...! Phoenix: Miles Edgeworth, of course. Maya: So he was on the elevator with his father! Phoenix: From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?) Suspect data Phoenix: Got any data on the suspect in there? Maya: Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it. Phoenix: The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently. Maya: So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it! Phoenix: But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond. Maya: Hammond... the victim in our case! Phoenix: Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared. Maya: Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder? Phoenix: (He may be closer than we think...) Present Anything Maya: Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here... After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth... Maya: Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out. Phoenix: Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need... DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how \"Dad\" will do testifying in court... To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\n-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle: It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Just after midnight,\" you say? Uncle: Ayup, just around then. Phoenix: Are you sure? Uncle: Pretty sure, ayup. Phoenix: When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today. Uncle: ... Karma: Karma: I asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!? Uncle: Zzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup. Karma: You see? Continue!Uncle: I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is there anyone who can verify that? Uncle: ... Well, I guess Polly could. Phoenix: Th-that's not good enough for a court of law! Judge: Mr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough? Phoenix: Ah, uh, Your Honor, this \"Polly\" is a parrot. Judge: A... parrot? Uncle: Don't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy! Judge: Keith...? Karma: Karma: The prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.Uncle: Then I heard a \"bang!\" Ayup.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And where did the \"bang\" seem to come from? Uncle: From the lake, I figure. Karma: Are you certain? Uncle: A-ayup. Karma: Good. Continue!Uncle: When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there someone in the boat? Uncle: It was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup. Phoenix: But you couldn't see them clearly! Uncle: Ayup... at the time, that is. Phoenix: (At the time...?)Uncle: Then I heard another \"bang.\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you heard two gunshots total? Uncle: Ayup. Phoenix: (That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle: Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"By your window\"? Uncle: Ayup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack. Phoenix: And, could you see the man's face? Uncle: Well, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him. Judge: This is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony. Uncle: ... Karma: Tsk, tsk, tsk... Phoenix: (I have a bad feeling about this...) Adds statement \"That man was the defendant... he was saying \"I can't believe he's dead.\"Uncle: That man was the defendant... he was saying \"I can't believe he's dead.\"Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"A-are you sure!?\"Phoenix: (If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)Phoenix: A-are you sure!?Uncle: ...Phoenix: (Uh oh!) D-Dad!Uncle: Dead certain, Keith! He said \"I can't believe he's dead\" as he was walking by, too.Karma: Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?Uncle: It was him! That Edgeworth boy!Judge: ... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.Phoenix: (von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)Karma: Tsk, tsk, tsk...Maya: N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!Phoenix: (I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)Raise an objection Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun! Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...? Phoenix: Exactly! Karma: That is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true! Leads to: \"Hmm...\"Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?) Karma: Judge! There is no room for doubt in the witness's testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict! Leads to: \"Hmm...\"Judge: Hmm...Phoenix: (The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)Raise an objection Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said \"I can' t believe he's dead\"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie... Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof! Phoenix: Urk... Maya: Nick! Do we have evidence...? Leads to: \"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\"Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.) Maya: Nick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure! Leads to: \"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\"Phoenix: It's no good! There's nothing I can do.Maya: A... are you sure?Phoenix: To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.Maya: Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.Judge: Enough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle: Zzzz...Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.Phoenix: (W-what!? No!)Karma: Hmph.Judge: This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!W-w-waaaaaaait!Judge: Wh-who was that just now?Me!!!Phoenix: Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!Judge: Wh-what are you doing here!?Butz: Listen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!Judge: Remembered what?Butz: The gunshot! I heard it too!Judge: O-order!Karma:Karma: What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge: One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz: Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!Judge: Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...Karma: Judge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!Maya: Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!Phoenix: (She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)Maya: Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!Phoenix: You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!Karma: A waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!Judge: Hmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!Karma: Wh-what is this!?Judge: I withdraw my previous verdict of \"guilty\"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!Karma: Whaaaat!Judge: The court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix: Whew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.Edgeworth: Hmph. I've seen worse.Phoenix: (Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.Maya: Larry was at the lake that night?Phoenix: Yes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.Maya: Oh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?Phoenix: Yeah.Edgeworth: ...Phoenix: Hey, Edgeworth.Edgeworth: ... Huh? You say something, Wright?Phoenix: Yeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?Edgeworth: It... it's nothing.Phoenix: Hmm?Maya: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth: What's that?Maya: Why are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth: Oh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really.Maya: I see...Edgeworth: Wright...Phoenix: Yeah?Edgeworth: This might be our chance.Phoenix: Our chance?Edgeworth: von Karma has only ever run perfect trials.Phoenix: Perfect trials...?Edgeworth: Perfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!Phoenix: What are you getting at?Edgeworth: It's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.Maya: That's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!Phoenix: Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything's on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release)December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge: Court is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.Butz: Right... leave it to me!Phoenix: (Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)Karma: ...Phoenix: (von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Butz: That night, I was out in a boat on the lake. I was looking for something and I, er, found it. So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock. Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"! I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat. So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Judge: Hmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor...Maya: What's wrong, Nick?Phoenix: It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.Maya: Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Butz: That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ... Judge: Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: There were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin... Judge: Ah... Phoenix: Um, well, okay. First of all, what time was it? Butz: Oh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak. Phoenix: And why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?Butz: I was looking for something and I, er, found it.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Looking for something\"...? Butz: Er, yeah. Judge: Mr. Butz, what was it you were looking for? Karma: Karma: What the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this \"Gourdy\"! Phoenix: (You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.) Karma: This is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with.Butz: So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Around what time was that? Butz: Uh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah. Judge: You're not sure? Butz: Hey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!? Phoenix: (People use watches these days, Larry...)Butz: Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did the sound come from? Butz: Yeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know. Judge: Did you look at the lake? Butz: Yeah, I looked.Butz: I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wasn't there a boat on the lake!? Judge: Order! Order! Well? Mr. Butz! Butz: Whoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not. Phoenix: (Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!) Karma: Hmph!Butz: So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you only heard one \"bang\" correct? Butz: Yeah. Phoenix: (Huh.)Present Lotta's Deposition Phoenix: Leads to: \"W-wait a sec, Larry!\"Maya: Well, Nick?Phoenix: Hmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it?

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given case. The testimonies are from Larry Butz, and the evidence list includes various items.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, the fifth one says Larry heard a single gunshot and went home. The evidence list includes Lotta's Deposition (evidence 11), which states she heard two gunshots. Also, the Autopsy Report (evidence 3) mentions the victim was shot once, but the Pistol (evidence 10) was fired three times. However, Larry's testimony about one gunshot contradicts Lotta's statement of two. But wait, the user provided testimonies from Larry here. Let me check the testimonies again.\n\nTestimony 3: Larry heard a \"bang\". Testimony 5: He heard a single gunshot. But the evidence Lotta's Deposition (11) says two gunshots. So Larry's testimony 5 (single shot) contradicts Lotta's Deposition (two shots). But in the given testimonies, testimony 3 is about the bang. Wait, the actual contradiction is between Larry's claim of one gunshot (testimony 5) and Lotta's Deposition (evidence 11) stating two. But the user's testimonies here are Larry's, so testimony 5 is Larry saying he heard one. The evidence 11 is Lotta's statement of two. So that's a contradiction. But the problem is to pick an evidence and testimony pair from the provided lists.\n\nWait, in the given testimonies, testimony 5 is Larry saying he heard a single gunshot. The evidence Lotta's Deposition (11) says two. So the contradiction would be between testimony 5 (Larry) and evidence 11 (Lotta's statement). But in the evidence list, evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition. So the pair would be evidence 11 and testimony 5. But the user's answer expects the testimony number as per the given list. Testimonies 0-5 are all from Larry. So testimony 5 is Larry's statement about hearing one shot. The evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition, which says two. Therefore, the correct answer is evidence 11 and testimony 5. But wait, the evidence index is 11, testimony index 5. So {\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\":5}."

Dare I ask why? Maya: Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one! Phoenix: ... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training? Maya: Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters! Phoenix: Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close... Maya: Oh. Darn. Phoenix: Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something? Maya: ... Good idea! Phoenix: (So much for the rushing spring waters...) TV: Next in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it \"Gourdy\" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ... Phoenix: *yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change? Maya: Nick? Phoenix: ? Maya: The water pressure's kind of low in that shower. Phoenix: ... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose? Maya: ... Good idea, Nick! Phoenix: (Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...)

Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections.

Maya: I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah! Phoenix: ... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back! Edgeworth: What are you doing here!? Maya: Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood. Phoenix: Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here? Edgeworth: So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing? Maya: Nick... Should we be laughing? Phoenix: Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you. Edgeworth: ... Yes you do. Phoenix: (Actually, he's right.) Edgeworth: ... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this. Phoenix: (I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release) Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room. Talk What happened Phoenix: Edgeworth. Tell me what happened. Edgeworth: ... Why should I? What are you going to do about it? Maya: Duh! We're going to help you, that's what! Edgeworth: ...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous. Phoenix: Sorry...? Edgeworth: You're a novice! You've only been in three trials! Phoenix: H-hey! Edgeworth: Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience! Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!? Gourd Lake Phoenix: The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct? Edgeworth: Yes... late last night. Phoenix: The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there? Edgeworth: ... I see no need to tell you. Maya: M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...? Edgeworth: ... Gourdy. Maya: Huh? Edgeworth: I went to see Gourdy. Maya: \"Gourdy\"? What's that!? Phoenix: I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?) Did you do it (appears after \"What happened\", \"Gourd Lake\", and presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right? Edgeworth: ... Think what you will. I have only one request. Phoenix: Huh? Edgeworth: Stay out of this case. Maya: Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you! Edgeworth: I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay? Maya: !!! Why not? Edgeworth: ... Look, just go away, and leave me alone! Maya: Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he. Phoenix: Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere. Maya: But, Nick... Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Your attorney's badge...? Phoenix: Edgeworth. Let me defend you. Edgeworth: ... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet. Maya: Wh-what do you mean by that? Edgeworth: Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never! Maya: Wh-what!? Edgeworth: My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared \"guilty.\" Phoenix: I don't believe it! Edgeworth: Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this. December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntrance Maya: This is where it happened? Phoenix: Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park. Maya: I can see some police walking around in there. Phoenix: Questioning people, probably. Maya: Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there? Gumshoe: Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything? Police: S-sorry, sir... Nothing. Gumshoe: Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double! Police: B-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who-- Gumshoe: Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release) Police: Y-yes, sir! Maya: Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today! Gumshoe: Recruits... peh! ... Aah! Maya: Eek! Gumshoe: Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz! Phoenix: Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?) Gumshoe: And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!? Phoenix: Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose. Gumshoe: Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it! Maya: He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet... Gumshoe: Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say... Examine Trees Phoenix: I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets? Maya: I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb. Phoenix: (Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.) Sign Phoenix: The sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. Maya: But... no waterfall. Phoenix: Not many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya. Talk What happened Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here? Gumshoe: Huh? You don't know, pal? Phoenix: No... Gumshoe: Wow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer. Phoenix: Head-in-the... huh? Gumshoe: Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol. Maya: And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth? Gumshoe: A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him. Maya: How did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake. Phoenix: A witness? Edgeworth Maya: You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Absolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it! Maya: R-right! Who cares what the witness says! Phoenix: (I care!) Maya: ... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective? Gumshoe: Course I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously. Maya: Oh no! Gumshoe: After all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side. Maya: Well, at least you are, Detective. At least you are. Defense request Maya: Do you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial? Gumshoe: He hasn't got one yet. Maya: What? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it? Gumshoe: Well, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case. Maya: W-why not? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him. Phoenix: U-unfortunately not... Gumshoe: Well, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney! Defense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Maya: I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case? Gumshoe: Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid. Phoenix: (I suppose it would be if they have a witness.) Gumshoe: Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent! Phoenix: I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said. Gumshoe: What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying \"Wright, Wright, Wright,\" over and over. Maya: ... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign. Phoenix: Neither am I... Gumshoe: Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it. The witness (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Who was this witness? Gumshoe: Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow. Phoenix: Was there only that one witness? Gumshoe: Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty... Maya: Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick? Phoenix: Talk to Santa. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: That badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it! After clearing all Talk options: Police: Detective Gumshoe, sir! Gumshoe: What? Find something!? Police: Um, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing... Gumshoe: A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back? The autopsy report Maya: Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...? Gumshoe: Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal! Leads to: \"You're not coming back, Detective?\" How to get in touch with you Leads to: \"You're not coming back, Detective?\" Phoenix: You're not coming back, Detective? Gumshoe: Erm... Probably not, pal. Phoenix: So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...? Gumshoe: Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime. Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station. Phoenix: Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: W-what!? Phoenix: Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around? Gumshoe: Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission. Maya: You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy. Phoenix: Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information... Maya: Right! Now, let's get investigating! December 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Maya: ... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here. Chief: Something wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...? Maya: N-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around? Chief: Gumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon. Maya: Okay, we'll come back. Chief: You do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that? Maya: ... Do I look like a criminal or something? Examine Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag...\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for interrogations. Desk Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Blue Badger Phoenix: Hey, is that the police department's mascot...? Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot! Phoenix: I... see. How nice. Chief: I'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do! Phoenix: Um, good luck! Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: Wha...!? \"Gourd Lake...!\" \"Gourdy sighted\"!!! I don't believe it! Phoenix: (Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?) December 25Gourd LakePublic Beach Maya: Wowsers! This is \"Gourd Lake\"? Phoenix: Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a \"wowsers,\" though. Maya: Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand! Phoenix: \"Samurai Dogs\"...? Maya: I wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great! Phoenix: With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be? Maya: They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into \"The Pink Princess\" now. I mean, like, y'know!? Phoenix: (Nope.) Examine Lake Maya: Wow. Gourd Lake is really big. Phoenix: Yeah. Maya: Say, Nick. Why is it called \"Gourd Lake\"? Phoenix: Oh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here. Maya: Whoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape? Phoenix: Well, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence. Maya: Oh. Okay. Trash can Phoenix: The trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained. Bench Phoenix: A lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog. Sign Phoenix: Huh... I almost didn't see that signpost. \"Left - Boat docks\" \"Right - Exit\" Vendor stand Phoenix: A hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads \"Samurai Dogs\"... Somebody needs to redecorate. Popper Maya: Huh. Someone left some poppers here. You know, you pull the string... (Changed from [Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...] in the original release) Phoenix: ...And it goes \"pop.\" Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's. Maya: Hey, Nick! They might be a clue! (Changed from [Hey, Nick! It might be a clue!] in the original release) Let's take them. (Changed from [Let's take it.] in the original release) Phoenix: C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop them, right? (Changed from [C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?] in the original release) Maya: Was it that obvious? Phoenix: (Poppers... hmm.) (Changed from [A popper... hmm.] in the original release) Take them (Changed from [Take it] in the original release) Phoenix: I suppose it couldn't hurt. Huh? Where'd they go? (Changed from [Huh? Where'd it go?] in the original release) Maya: Into my pocket. (Changed from [I already put it in my pocket.] in the original release) Poppers put in pocket. (Changed from [Popper put in pocket.] in the original release) Leads back to examination Leave them (Changed from [Leave it] in the original release) Phoenix: Nah, let's leave them. (Changed from [Nah, let's leave it.] in the original release) Maya: Aww, listen to your inner child a little, Nick! Phoenix: (Maybe if you outer child would be quiet for just a moment, Maya!) Leads back to examination Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Anything else Maya: Nick! If we don't hurry Mr. Edgeworth will get the death sentence!!! Phoenix: Whoa! O-okay! Let's go check things out. Detention Center Present Anything else Edgeworth: What's that? I'm not in the mood for idle banter, Wright. December 25Boat Rental Shop Maya: Nick... what is this place? Phoenix: A boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either. Maya: Boats... I've never ridden on a boat. Phoenix: Really? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished? Maya: Hey, good idea! You bet! Examine Trees Phoenix: There's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there. Shop Phoenix: A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas. Boats Phoenix: There are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder? Maya: Nick? Phoenix: Huh? Maya: I changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride. December 25Gourd Lake Woods Maya: I like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping! Phoenix: They've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder. Maya: Hey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder! Phoenix: (That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them. Examine Camera Maya: Hey, Nick. Check out this camera! Phoenix: Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard. Maya: Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"YO! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK! Phoenix: Will you stop that? Maya: I think it's broken, Nick. Phoenix: D-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.) Camera (after Popper is added to the Court Record) Leads to: \"This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment.\" Trees Phoenix: The trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them. Sign Phoenix: The sign says \"No Camping.\" Funny place to pick to pitch your tent. Maya: Wait, what if the sign said \"No Setting Tents on Fire\"? Phoenix: ... I don't think they have signs like that. Maya: Oh... Sheet Phoenix: There's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold. Campfire Maya: Hey, Nick! Phoenix: What, don't tell me you're hungry again? Maya: No, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum? Phoenix: ... They didn't talk about that in any of the law books. Maya: So, there's no law saying they have to be made out of aluminum, then! Phoenix: (I'm not having this conversation...) SUV Phoenix: This SUV has seen better days. It's dented all over. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here. Phoenix: This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise. Maya: Wow! Cool! Let's try it out! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"HEY! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK! Phoenix: Will you stop that? Maya: Maybe it's broken? Phoenix: D-don't kick it! Maybe it isn't set up to respond to voices? Maya: Well what then? These things? (Changed from [Well what then? I know!] in the original release) Phoenix: The party poppers...? (Changed from [The party popper...?] in the original release) *BANG* klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik Maya: ... Well. It responded. (Changed from [... Yep. It responded.] in the original release) ???: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw! Hey, you! Git yer hands offa' that! Maya: Eek! ???: What in the Sam Hill...!? Look what ya done now! There goes a whole roll of film! Maya: Ah? Wha... huh? S-sorry! ???: Sorry's nice but it don't pay my bills! Y'all know how much a roll of that film costs!? Maya: I-I'll pay you back! ???: What were ya'll thinkin' settin' off a party-popper in a place like this? Maya: Uh... well... ???: What! Don't try to play stupid with me just 'cause you think I'm some country bumpkin! Yeah, I know how y'all Yanks think! \"I say, those southern folks talk with that exaggerated drawl, why they must be dumb!\" Well let me tell you, just because I might be dumb don't mean we all are! Maya: N-Nick, help! ???: And who are you, now? Her chaperone? Phoenix: Yeah, uh, no, rather, uhh... we're sort of... friends? ???: Jus' figure out what y'all are gonna say and say it for bejeezum's sake! Gawd, I'd rather sit through one of papa's drawls than listen to you stutter all day. Phoenix: (Oh boy... I guess we should pay her for the film...) ???: Watch it! Phoenix: Yes ma'am. (On second thought, I'll pay later...) Maya: I'm really sorry! Examine Camera Phoenix: This camera is rigged to respond to noise. But it only responds to loud noises... like a party popper. Talk Any option Phoenix: Ummm... ???: What!? Can't ya see I'm changin' the film on my camera here! Someone--I'm not namin' any names--but someone used up a WHOLE ROLL. Maya: Sorry... Phoenix: (That didn't work... I wonder if I have anything to show her that would get her attention...) Present Attorney's Badge Leads to: \"I, er, this is my badge.\" Phoenix: I, er, this is my badge. ???: Huh? Aren't badges supposed t' be all shiny and impressive? You a cop or something? Phoenix: Umm... I'm a lawyer. ???: Wh-what!? Y'all ain't gonna try and pull one o' them lawsuits on me over that film now? Cause I'll have you know I'm a fighter and I wrassled meaner looking' things'n you! Phoenix: N-no, that's not it at all. We're here investigating a murder that took place here, on the lake. ???: A murder...? ... Sounds cool! Why didn't y'all say that in the first place! Go ahead, ask me anything ya like! Phoenix: (Finally! Some cooperation!) ???: You too. Y'all can come out of hiding now. I won't bite. Hard. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, where did Maya get to?) Maya: S-sorry... I-I was feeling a little overwhelmed. The culture gap and all... ???: Never you mind, honey. I kin' talk Yank for ya if... ahem... if it pleases you? Maya: Th-thanks. I think I'll be okay. Lotta: Great then! I'm Lotta, Lotta Hart, but y'all can call me Lotta! I'm here photographing meteor showers for a research project. Mighty pleased ta meet ya! Talk What happened Lotta: Oh yeah, when was that murder, anyway? I ain't seen much television lately. Phoenix: It happened late in the night on Christmas Eve. Lotta: That so? Christmas Eve? Phoenix: A man on a boat was shot... Did you see anything? Lotta: Well, lemme see. A boat, ya say? I reckon I mighta seen one... not sure though. Y'all gotta remember I've been watching this here lake for a good three days now. I seen enough boats to choke a mule. Kinda hard to remember which I seen when. Lotta Maya: So, what is it you do, Lotta? Lotta: Huh? Me? Hah hah. Y'all don't really want to know that, do ya? Actually, I'm a research student at Country U., right in the heart of the heartland. Maya: Wow! Neat! Nick! She's a research student at a university! Country U.! Phoenix: Uh... so I hear. Maya: So, when did you come up here? Lotta: Hmm, lemme see... I guess it was 'bout three days ago. Phoenix: What are you photographing? Lotta: D-didn't I tell y'all that already? Meteors! Yep, meteor showers! Phoenix: (Falling stars...?) The camera (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: That's quite a camera you have there. Lotta: Y'all better know it! It's German-made. A genuine Solingen! Phoenix: (Isn't that where they make knives...?) Maya: Umm... So, what's that device you have stuck to the camera? Lotta: Huh? Device? Maya: It started moving all by itself when I fired my party popper... Lotta: Oh that? That triggers the shutter whenever it detects certain sounds. It's programmed to pick up loud noises right now. Maya: A programmable camera! Neat! Lotta's Camera added to the Court Record. The camera (subsequent times) Maya: That's quite a camera you have there. Lotta: Y'all better know it! It's German-made. A genuine Solingen! Phoenix: (Isn't that where they make knives...?) Maya: Umm... So, what's that device you have stuck to the camera? Lotta: Huh? Device? Maya: It started moving all by itself when I fired my party popper... Lotta: Oh that? That triggers the shutter whenever it detects certain sounds. It's programmed to pick up loud noises right now. Maya: A programmable camera! Neat! Present Attorney's Badge Lotta: So yer a lawyer, huh? Tell the truth, yer badge is a lot more impressive than you are. Maya: Hah hah! Phoenix: *glare* Maya: Hah... hah... oh. Ahem. Lotta's Camera Leads to: \"Lotta?\" Phoenix: Lotta? Lotta: Yeah? Phoenix: So, your camera... it triggers on loud explosion noises? Lotta: Ayup. Phoenix: Actually, the victim in the case we're researching--he was shot with a pistol. Lotta: A pistol...? Phoenix: Right. Now wouldn't a gunshot make a similar noise to our party popper...? Lotta: I guess it would. Phoenix: Your camera... didn't get a picture of the murder, did it? Lotta: ... Hey! Y'all are pretty bright! Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: I see what yer sayin'... Tell ya what, I'll have a look-see at my film. Phoenix: It would have been a photo taken late last night... Lotta: I checked 'em once, don't remember if there was anything on 'em though. But what if I got sumtin'! I could be witness to a genuine murder! Yeehaw! I'll go check that film. Y'all come back now, y'hear? Maya: She went inside her SUV. I guess we should come back later... Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Lotta's Camera Maya: Who was that with the camrea...? Lotta something? Let's go talk to her about that photograph! After presenting Lotta's Camera in Gourd Lake Woods: December 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Maya: ... I guess Detective Gumshoe is still in that meeting. Gumshoe: Hey! Thanks for coming down, pal! Maya: Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: We just finished the meeting. For better or for worse... Phoenix: (I get the feeling we're in for some bad news...) Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"All right, hands against the wall, all o' you... Don't even think about escaping! I got eyes in the back of my head!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for arrests. Talk The victim Phoenix: Do you know anything about the victim yet? Gumshoe: No, no... Still can't I.D. him. Maya: Has Mr. Edgeworth said anything? Gumshoe: Not a word. The meeting Phoenix: So, how did the meeting go? Gumshoe: I can't tell you, pal! You're a lawyer! Phoenix: T-true... Gumshoe: ... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that? Maya: So, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...? Gumshoe: Well, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled. Maya: I see... Gumshoe: ... Phoenix: Umm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting! Gumshoe: ... Don't go telling anyone else, pal. Phoenix: Y-yes, sir! Gumshoe: And... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us. Maya: Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. Trusting Edgeworth (appears after \"The meeting\") Maya: Detective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much? Gumshoe: Well, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works. Maya: A \"working relationship\"? Gumshoe: See, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared \"guilty\" every time. Yeah, his methods might be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us. Maya: I see... Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust... And you have my word on that! The autopsy report (appears after \"Trusting Edgeworth\") Phoenix: I was wondering, did you ever get that autopsy report? Gumshoe: Oh, that? Yeah, I made a copy for you. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Added Autopsy Report to the Court Record.] in the original release) Phoenix: Thank you. Maya: ...Nick? Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Can you show me that photo of the victim? ... That face...! Phoenix: Someone you know? Maya: I... I don't know. I just have this feeling that I met him somewhere a long time ago. ... The autopsy report (subsequent times) Maya: ... Phoenix: (Maya seems lost in thought.) You remember anything? Maya: ... Phoenix: (Guess not.) Present Autopsy Report Gumshoe: Well, I hope it helps you, pal. Phoenix: Thanks, Detective. Anything else Gumshoe: Sorry, I'm drawing a blank right now. Wright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"The autopsy report\" Talk option in Police Department - Criminal Affairs) Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: Oh. Nothing... Just, something's been bothering me. ... Could you show me that autopsy report once more? ... ... ... Hey! I-I remember now! This guy! This is a lawyer that was at that office Mia worked at! I met him once when I went there to hang out with Sis! Phoenix: That office...? Wait! You mean Grossberg's office? Maya: Right! That guy! Phoenix: (That was the last name I expected to come up... Maybe I should go talk to him... for old time's sake.) Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: Hmm... The police have pretty much made up their minds that Mr. Edgeworth did it. And Mr. Edgeworth won't tell us anything. I guess we could go look for clues down by the lake? Phoenix: Right. Any ideas Phoenix: Well? Penny for your thoughts? Maya: Thoughts... Thoughts... Yeah, why won't Mr. Edgeworth tell us anything? And... and... And why did he refuse to ask for our help? What a jerk! Present Autopsy Report Maya: Nick... This person was a lawyer at Grossberg's office. Let's go talk to him! Mr. Grossberg, I mean, not the dead guy. December 25Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: It's been a while since I was here last. Mr. Grossberg is out as usual. Maya: Hey, Nick. Look at the wall. Phoenix: (That painting is still missing... Mia must have known about the deal with Mr. Grossberg and Redd White... She kept track of all of White's extortion and blackmail rackets.) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read. Maya: Well then let's take them back to our office! He won't miss them! Phoenix: Uh, we don't need them. Maya: Then, can we take that wooden bear? Phoenix: (Hmm. It is kind of cute.) Desk Phoenix: A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster. Maya: Hey, Nick! I want a desk like that in our office too! Phoenix: I don't know. I don't think I'm ready to sit at a desk like that yet. Maya: Huh? I meant for me! Phoenix: You'd better start saving your allowance, then. Vacant wall Maya: Why is the wall there a different color? Phoenix: A big painting was hanging there until recently. Maya: Huh. What happened to it? Phoenix: Uh... well, he gave it to someone. Maya: I bet he gave it to some romantic interest! Love blooms eternal, Nick! Phoenix: Uh... yeah. Potted plant Phoenix: An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available. Maya: I think our Charley is cuter. Phoenix: Right. He's a really cute... plant. Table Phoenix: A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn. Maya: We should put things on our client table too. Phoenix: I'm not really into smoking. Maya: We could put out candy, or gum. Phoenix: Classy... Detention Center Present Autopsy Report Edgeworth: ... I'm sorry. I can't think of anything I want to say about that. After clearing \"The autopsy report\" Talk option in Police Department - Criminal Affairs: December 25Gourd Lake Woods Lotta: Hey y'all! Maya: Lotta! Lotta: Wait up a sec! We got bingo! Maya: Bingo...? Lotta: My automatic camera took two pictures last night! Maya: Hey! Lotta: This is them. Take a look! Phoenix: Wait...! Lotta: See? See? He's shooting him with that pistol! Phoenix: I-it looks like that, yes. Maya: But you can't really tell who that is shooting. Lotta: Yeah, well there was enough fog out there last night t' strangle a bullfrog. But, y'know... Seeing these photos reminded me of something. Maya: What...? Lotta: I saw the murder happen. I'm a witness! Maya: Whaaaaaaa!? Phoenix: A-are you serious!? Lotta: Course! Phoenix: (How do you forget... never mind.) Lotta: Y'all reckon I should tell the cops? I reckon so Phoenix: I... reckon so! Lotta: What's that? Now don't y'all go tryin' to mock my accent! I'm a sensitive lady! Leads to: \"Hey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops.\" I reckon no Phoenix: I... reckon no! Lotta: What's that? Now don't y'all think y'all can pull one over on me just cause you speak the lingo! I know enough to know that when you see a murder, you'd best tell the cops! It's my obligation as a citizen! Leads to: \"Hey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops.\" Lotta: Hey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops. Y'all can have this photo. Later. Phoenix: W-w-wait! Lotta! Lotta: What? Can't y'all see I'm kinda busy? Phoenix: T-tell us what you saw, too! Please? Lotta: Nice try, honey, but I wasn't born yesterday. I'm a witness, and that means I'm on the side of justice, and that means the cops! I'd sooner eat the south side of a north-bound skunk than tell you! Maya: L-Lotta! Lotta: Don't let it get your skivvies in a bunch. Friends today, enemies tomorrow! Or was that the other way round? No matter. I'm gone! Hey! Maybe they'll let me do some testifying! Hot darn! Maya: She left... ... Well, that's one more witness. What do we do now, Nick? Phoenix: (Well, if she saw something, there's not much we can do about it. The question is: what exactly did she see...? I guess we'll find out in the trial tomorrow.) Lake Photo added to the Court Record. Examine Camera Phoenix: An expensive-looking camera faces the lake. Next to it is a large microphone and a blue plastic sheet. Hmm. Looks like a computer is attached to the camera. December 25Gourd LakePublic Beach Maya: Looks like the police have given up their interviewing. (Changed from [Looks like the police have given up their questioning.] in the original release) ???: Hey! Maya: Aah! N-Nick! I think Santa's mad at you! ???: Long time no see, Nick. Maya: Nick... you know Santa!? Wow... Nick and St. Nick... Hey! I see the connection! Phoenix: Don't be ridiculous! ???: Dude, it's me! Phoenix: L... Larry! What are you doing here!? Butz: Isn't it obvious? I'm working my day job! I sell Samurai Dogs! Want one? Gotta get money for dates, you know, My girl Kiyance deserves the best! Phoenix: (K-Kiyance...? Not another model, I hope...) Butz: Oh, Kiyance's a fine, fine woman, Nick. It was her idea that I wear this costume! She was all \"You go girlfriend!\" Y'know? She bought this costume for me! Phoenix: That... that's great, Larry. Maya: Wow! A Santa costume! She must be really nice! Butz: Whoa! Cute! Nick! Who's she? She's not your...? Phoenix: Not my... what? N-no, she's not! Maya: I'm his partner, Maya Fey. I'm, uh, the little sister. Butz: Sister...? ... Wow, Nick, must be tough. Working nine to five, having to take care of a little sister... Maya: N-no, I'm not Nick's sister, I'm my older sister's little sister... Butz: Huh. Sounds great! Phoenix: (Don't worry, Maya, he's not listening...) Examine Bench Maya: Hey, Nick, benches! Let's take a break... maybe have a dog? Phoenix: I think not. It's too cold to sit and eat hotdogs out here! Maya: Wimpy city boy! You should try standing under a freezing waterfall some time! Stand Phoenix: I can't get over the Samurai Dogs... Maya: The \"Original\" Samurai Dogs, no less. Butz: Hey, man, whoever calls their product the \"original\" first wins! Phoenix: Why don't you add \"world-famous\" to the sign? Butz: Hey, good idea! Phoenix: (What have I done...?) Talk What happened Phoenix: Hey, Larry. There was a murder here last night... And since you work here... Have you heard anything? (Changed from [You work here. Have you heard anything?] in the original release) Maya: Nick, you're wasting your time. Last night was Christmas Eve! He was with Kiyance, obviously! He wouldn't have been standing out here in the cold! Butz: Oof! Maya: ? Phoenix: I think what you just said caught him off guard, Maya. Butz: N-no, it's just... Kiyance's not in town right now. She... she's in Hawaii on a photo shoot. Phoenix: (A model. I knew it.) Well, anyway, there was a murder here on the lake. The trial's tomorrow. Butz: Huh. Neat. Phoenix: The defendant is Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. Maya: Um, Nick? Why would Larry know Edgeworth...? Butz: Whoa, Nick! You don't mean THAT Miles Edgeworth!? Old Edgey!? Phoenix: Yeah. He's a murder suspect. Butz: Wh-whoa! Murder? Maya: Huh? You know Mr. Edgeworth, Larry? Butz: Yeah! Of course! Edgey was in the same class as us in grade school! Maya: Whaaaaaaaaat!? Samurai Dogs Maya: Umm... umm... tell me about the dogs! Butz: Huh? Oh, you mean the Samurai Dogs? Maya: W-why are they Samurai Dogs? I... I mean they kind of look gourd-shaped. Butz: Oh, well originally, they were Gourd Dogs! Y'know, like \"guard dogs\"? Maya: Ouch... Butz: The Samurai thing was Kiyance's idea. Oh, she's my woman, y'know. She was all \"change the name and you go girlfriend!\" She made me that banner! Man, the kids can't get enough of those Samurai Dogs! Maya: Err... Something about that just seems... wrong. Butz: Oh, and guess what? We're getting a ton of customers here at the lake, what with the big news! Maya: The \"big news\"...? Butz: Yeah! Gourdy! Maya: G-\"Gourdy\"...? Edgeworth (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, Mr. Edgeworth was your classmate, Larry? Butz: Yeah, Nick, him, and I used to hang out all the time. Maya: Wow... I never knew. Butz: Don't get me wrong. He's always been kind of a stick in the mud. Studying all the time, trying to \"be like father.\" Maya: Like his father...? Butz: Yeah. Edgey's pop was a famous defense lawyer back in the day. Maya: Wow. Wait... You said \"defense lawyer\"? Butz: Yeah. Maya: Wait a second! But Mr. Edgeworth is a prosecuting attorney! Butz: What? Edgey's got a proboscis on his knee!? Maya: No, no--he's a \"prosecuting attorney.\" That's like the total opposite of a defense lawyer! Butz: ... Huh. Go figure! He always used to talk about defending the \"weak\" who were \"unable to defend themselves.\" Man, he used to go on and on about man's duty to society and all that. What a bore! I wonder what changed his mind, though? Do you know, Nick? Phoenix: ... Maya: Nick...? Gourdy (appears after \"Samurai Dogs\") Maya: Umm... what's \"Gourdy\"? Butz: Huh? You mean you don't know? It's here, in this very lake! A giant, mysterious monster! Gourdy! Maya: A... monster? Butz: Yeah. Check it out. This is an article from yesterday's newspaper. There's a photo! Maya: Wow! It's r-really real! Nick! A monster! A real monster! Phoenix: Umm... yeah. (It's probably just a log or something... right?) Hey... there's a quote here from the person who took the photo. Hmm? What's this? \"I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud 'bang'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water...\" Maya: I wish I could have seen it! Phoenix: (Why would there be a sound like an explosion...?) Larry. Could I borrow this article from you? Butz: Sure, no problem. That'll be one million dollars! Maya: O-one million...? Phoenix: (Grow up, Larry.) Gourdy Article added to the Court Record. Gourdy (subsequent times) Maya: Hey Nick, show me that article once more. \"I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud 'bang'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water...\" How romantic! And cool! I mean, to think, a real monster! Butz: Yeah. I'm just glad I'm selling more dogs! Present Attorney's Badge Butz: Huh? Oh, that's your attorney's badge, isn't it? Dude, you really helped me out back in that trial. S-sorry, I can't really pay you. Phoenix: (Cause you blow it all on \"Kiyance\"...!) Butz: But... you can have all the dogs you want! Maya: R-really!? Phoenix: Larry... If you let her at your dogs, you won't have any left for the other customers. Butz: Hey, no problem. If that's what makes her happy, y'know? Phoenix: (How many times do I have to remind you that it was ME who got you off the hook!) Lotta's Camera Butz: Whazzat? Phoenix: It's a camera. You take pictures with it. Butz: Huh? Maya: L-Larry! You mean you don't know what a camera is!? Butz: C-course I know! Hey, you're looking at a bona fide junior high graduate! I was talking about the weird contraption on that camera! Phoenix: Oh, that. Well... it's hard to explain. Just forget about it. Butz: Well don't go showing me it, then! Geez! Autopsy Report Phoenix: Hey Larry, you know this guy? Butz: Who's this? Phoenix: I don't know. That' why I asked you. Butz: Who's this, Maya? Maya: Well... Lake Photo Butz: W-what's this? You know, my eyes have been getting pretty bad lately, Nick... Phoenix: Actually, the photo's blurry, Larry. It was taken last night. Butz: Last night...? Anything else Butz: Sorry, Nick. I don't know much about that. I'm just a simple vendor of Samurai Dogs, dig? December 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Maya: ... Not a Gumshoe in sight. Police: If you're looking for Detective Gumshoe, he's in the questioning room. Apparently, an important witness turned up. He'll be in there for a while. Maya: Lotta Hart... it has to be. Phoenix: Uh oh... Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"...move in the crowd. Wear drab clothes... Never enter the target's field of vision...\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for trailing. Detention Center Present Lake Photo Edgeworth: Hmph... Who would have thought there'd be a photo...? Phoenix: Edgeworth... Did you shoot him? Edgeworth: ... What do you think, Wright? Phoenix: I don't think you're the kind to point a gun at anyone, no. Maya: So you didn't shoot him? Edgeworth: No, I didn't. It wasn't me. After clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake - Public Beach: December 25Grossberg Law Offices Grossberg: *Ah-HHHHEM!* Phoenix: (Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat!) Grossberg: Ah hah! You're Mia's... something, are you not? Phoenix: I was her understudy, yes. Phoenix Wright. Grossberg: Ah hah! And you, you're Mia's... something too, are you not? Maya: Her little sister, yes! Grossberg: You've grown! You've come to look a lot like your sister, you know? It takes me back. \"Ahh... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...\" you see. Phoenix: Um, Mr. Grossberg, sir? Grossberg: Hmm...? Ah, yes. I beg your pardon. Of course you came here to discuss something. What is it then? Something the matter? Talk What happened Phoenix: There was a murder last night... Grossberg: A murder? Phoenix: You haven't heard...? Grossberg: I, er, just got up, you see. Phoenix: Well, Miles Edgeworth shot someone with a pistol. Grossberg: Edgeworth!? What!? W-who!? Phoenix: Well, the identity of the victim is still unknown. Grossberg: T-this is terrible news indeed! Phoenix: (I guess he hadn't heard anything...) That painting Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg? Whatever happened to that painting? Grossberg: Oh, yes... I do not think it shall ever be coming back home to this office. I can't exactly claim it as stolen... I suppose it's my just desserts. Old, bitter desserts. Robert Hammond (appears after presenting Autopsy Report) Phoenix: Who is this Hammond guy, anyway? Grossberg: Mr. Hammond... He was the defense attorney in that case... Phoenix: \"That case\"...? Grossberg: Yes, the \"DL-6 Incident.\" Phoenix: \"DL-6\"...? (Why does that sound so familiar?) Grossberg: Perhaps you remember? Phoenix: (I'm sure someone mentioned it during the trial for Mia's murder.) Grossberg: That was the incident where the police were so at a loss they used a spirit medium. Maya: ...! Wait... you don't mean? Was that medium my mother? Grossberg: Yes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss. No conviction was made. The DL-6 Incident (appears after \"Robert Hammond\") Grossberg: The DL-6 Incident, yes... Happened 15 years ago. A very strange case, indeed. Phoenix: They never caught the criminal, right? Grossberg: Correct. Misty Fey used her powers to talk to the spirit of the late victim. Her testimony led to charges being laid against one man. But Mr. Hammond won the case and the suspect was declared innocent. Maya: ... And the police blamed my mother, calling her a fraud. You were the one who helped her out then, right, Mr. Grossberg? Grossberg: Er... y-yes. Yes, quite. Maya: Thank you! Grossberg: N-no... please. D-don't mention it. Phoenix: ... (DL-6... Never thought I'd hear that name again...) Maya: But wait... What does this case have anything to do with Mr. Edgeworth? Grossberg: It has everything to do with Mr. Edgeworth, my dear! The victim in the DL-6 Incident was none other than his father, Gregory Edgeworth! Maya: Wh-what!? His father!? Grossberg: ... If you want to know more, you should ask him yourself. Show him this... I'm sure he'll talk to you. Maya: Wait... This is a photograph of my mother! Misty Fey's Photo added to the Court Record. The DL-6 Incident (subsequent times) Grossberg: The DL-6 Incident, yes... Happened 15 years ago. A very strange case, indeed. Phoenix: They never caught the criminal, right? Grossberg: Correct. Misty Fey used her powers to talk to the spirit of the late victim. Her testimony led to charges being laid against one man. But Mr. Hammond won the case and the suspect was declared innocent. Maya: ... And the police blamed my mother, calling her a fraud.

The victim in the DL-6 Incident was none other than his father, Gregory Edgeworth! Maya: Wh-what!? His father!? Grossberg: ... If you want to know more, you should ask him yourself. Present Attorney's Badge Grossberg: You've really grown up in the past few years, my dear! How proud Mia would be if she could see you now! Maya: She said she was more worried about me than anything. Phoenix: Aww, just go on and take the compliment, will you? Lotta's Camera Grossberg: So, this camera on the lake takes a photo whenever it hears an explosion sound? Maya: That's what she said. Grossberg: And it just happened to be set up on the beach, pointing out on the lake? Maya: Yes... she said it was to photograph \"shooting stars.\" Grossberg: Hmm. Shooting stars... explosions... what's the connection? I'd be suspicious of this witness of yours. Autopsy Report Grossberg: Hmm? Strange... I feel as though I've seen this man somewhere before! ... Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Did you remember!? Grossberg: He was a lawyer! Here, in my office! That's Hammond! Robert Hammond! Maya: Mr. Hammond...? Grossberg: And you say this is the man Miles Edgeworth shot? Lake Photo Grossberg: So this is the moment the crime took place, eh? Phoenix: Yes. Grossberg: You can't really say for sure that's Edgeworth. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Not sure at all... Misty Fey's Photo Grossberg: Misty Fey. Mother of Mia and Maya Fey. Show this photograph to Miles Edgeworth. He'll have something to say to you then. Anything else Grossberg: Er... my apologies. I'm not sure I can help you with that. Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Misty Fey's Photo Maya: My mother... ... Phoenix: (Now that I've shown her the picture, I can't think of anything to say... That probably wasn't the best thing to do.) December 25Detention CenterVisitor's Room Edgeworth: What's this? I was hoping you'd gotten my message the first time. Phoenix: Edgeworth, what about your defense? Edgeworth: ...! It's no concern of yours. Phoenix: (Guess he hasn't found anyone yet.) Talk What happened Phoenix: Can I ask you about the murder? Edgeworth: Wright. I'll ask you again, just leave me alone. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: Please try to understand. I'm not doing this to prove I'm tough, or because I look down on you. I just don't want you anywhere near this case. Understand? Gourd Lake Phoenix: Why did you go to Gourd Lake? Edgeworth: I have no intention of telling you. Phoenix: Nor, apparently, would you tell Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: ! Maya: Detective Gumshoe was really worried about you! Edgeworth: ... The DL-6 Incident (appears after presenting Misty Fey's Photo) Edgeworth: The \"DL-6 Incident\"... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all. Maya: ...! Edgeworth: My memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name. Phoenix: And Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder? Edgeworth: Correct. Maya: Umm... That spirit medium... that was my mom. Edgeworth: What? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this. Phoenix: \"About to end\"? Edgeworth: The DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28. Maya: December 28? Edgeworth: The statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days. Phoenix: What!? Maya: Um, Nick? What does that mean? Phoenix: When a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened. Edgeworth: Three days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever. The suspect (appears after \"The DL-6 Incident\") Maya: What happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent? Edgeworth: I don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now. Phoenix: (I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.) Your father (appears after \"The DL-6 Incident\") Maya: Umm... so, was your father a lawyer? Edgeworth: He was... Gregory Edgeworth. He was quite famous at the time, apparently. Maya: So, you were sort of trying to follow in his footsteps. Edgeworth: ... I'd rather not talk about it. Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: Your attorney's badge...? I can't say I really want to see one of those right now. Misty Fey's Photo Edgeworth: ...! ... Phoenix: Edgeworth? Edgeworth: It's only been a matter of hours since you last visited. Yet you've made incredible progress in your investigation. I'll admit it, I'm impressed, Wright. You were always single-minded in your work, though. Once you start on something, you always see it through, don't you? Phoenix: About the \"DL-6 Incident\"... Edgeworth: Right... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6. Phoenix: So... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away? Edgeworth: I don't know. But... I see no point in hiding anything from you now. Very well. Ask whatever you like, and I will answer to the best of my abilities. Removes \"What happened\" and \"Gourd Lake\" Talk options, adds \"The DL-6 Incident\" Talk option After clearing all Talk options and presenting Lake Photo: Edgeworth: ... Wright. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: It pains me to ask you this now... Maya: I know! You want us to defend you! Edgeworth: Yes... Will you? Of course we will Phoenix: Ah, who could have guessed this day would come? Edgeworth: Not me. Leads to: \"This is my chance to finally pay you back.\" Of course we won't Phoenix: Sorry, charley! No way! Edgeworth: Wright... Maya: Nick...!? ... Phoenix: H-hey, don't look so serious, guys! I was kidding! Just a little joke! Edgeworth: There was nothing little... Maya: ...or joke-like about it! Phoenix: (I thought it was funny...) Maya: Nick! Do it over! Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. How could I refuse you, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Thank you, Wright. Leads to: \"This is my chance to finally pay you back.\" Phoenix: This is my chance to finally pay you back. Maya: Pay him back...? Edgeworth: Pay me back? For what? I don't remember ever doing anything for you. Phoenix: Never mind... I guess you don't really need to know. Edgeworth: Huh... My letter of request. Please give it to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth's Request put in pocket. Phoenix: Well, I guess we should... ... W-what's that!? Maya: E-earthquake! Nick! It's a big one! Whaaaaa! I-it's calming down... ... Whew... that was scary! Phoenix: ...? Huh? Where's Edgeworth? Maya: ... There. He's on the floor in a ball, shivering. I guess he doesn't do so well with earthquakes. Phoenix: (I've heard of running, but curling up in a ball?) Maya: Well, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick. Phoenix: Uh.. right. We have to give Edgeworth's letter of request to Detective Gumshoe. Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. After Edgeworth's Request is added to the Court Record: December 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Gumshoe: What's going on here!? Maya: Eek! Phoenix: W-what's wrong, Detective? Gumshoe: This wild lady comes in here just a while ago... Says she came \"to talk to y'all after hearing what Mr. Wright had to say\"! What's this all about, pal!? Phoenix: (Lotta Hart...) Gumshoe: Why are you going around finding more witnesses!? You want to give Mr. Edgeworth the death sentence, pal!? Phoenix: N-no, not at all... Just... I mean, she did see something. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't go around covering up evidence! Gumshoe: Er... You trying to say something about the way I do my job? Phoenix: No sir! Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"Never talk to people in the neighborhood... Turn all the lights in the room off, and close the curtains...\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for a stake-out. Talk Lotta's testimony Phoenix: So... what did Ms. Hart say? Gumshoe: She says she saw Mr. Edgeworth fire the pistol. Maya: What!? Gumshoe: She even had a photograph to prove it. Phoenix: Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting. Gumshoe: That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\" Maya: She can do that!? Phoenix: (Okay, so there's going to be an enlarged photograph that shows Edgeworth in the act. Great. Just great.) Gumshoe: In any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow. Maya: Huh? What happened to the other witness? Gumshoe: Well... Apparently, there was a cancellation. Phoenix: (A \"cancellation\"...!?) Tomorrow's trial Gumshoe: I'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out. Phoenix: (I'd say that sounds like a pretty unwinnable case... But wait... What did Mia used to say? If he's innocent, there's got to be something I've overlooked...) Edgeworth Gumshoe: It sound like Mr. Edgeworth is going to ask the state to assign a public defender. I was just asked to file the paperwork. But you still got time, pal! Go talk to him again, for me, please! You have to convince him! You have to make him let you defend him! Please! I know you're the only one who can do it, pal. You're the only one who can save Mr. Edgeworth! Present Edgeworth's Request Leads to: \"Look what I got.\" Anything else Gumshoe: Hey, pal, there's only one thing I want to see from you! And that's a letter of request from Mr. Edgeworth for you to be his defense attorney! Phoenix: Look what I got. Gumshoe: ... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you! Phoenix: Thanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then. Gumshoe: Good luck, pal. Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried! Maya: Worried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now. Gumshoe: Oh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth! Phoenix: (Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it. Gumshoe: Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later! Maya: ... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes? Phoenix: I wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school. Phoenix: (Then again, I only really got to know him in 4th grade. (Changed from [Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade.] in the original release) He transferred to another school after that. I wonder what happened to Edgeworth...) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Goodbyes Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 December 26, 9:44 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2 Phoenix: Karma...? (ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release) Edgeworth: That's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god! Maya: Not a single case? Edgeworth: He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything. Phoenix: Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared. Phoenix: (That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...) Edgeworth: He taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\" Phoenix: Wh-what!? Edgeworth: Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten. Maya: Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Something like that... Maya: And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out. Edgeworth: Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty! Maya: That's pretty ruthless... Edgeworth: Like I said. He's a god among prosecutors. Phoenix: (I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya? Maya: Uh huh? Phoenix: We could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think? Maya: Oh... Phoenix: ? Maya: I can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach. Phoenix: You couldn't \"reach\"? Maya: I think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again... Phoenix: Oh man, what bad timing! Maya: I'm really sorry. I'll try my best! Phoenix: I hope so! Edgeworth: What are you whispering about? Phoenix: O-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in... December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Karma: ... Judge: Err, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready? Karma: ... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared? Judge: R-right, my apologies! Phoenix: (He's even got the Judge scared!) Judge: Very well, your opening statement, please. Karma: ... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required? Judge: Ah... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness. Maya: What's with this guy? Is he royalty or something? Phoenix: How am I supposed to fight against this!? Karma: I call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe. Phoenix: (Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.) Karma: Describe the incident. Now! Gumshoe: Y-yessir! Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...) Gumshoe: Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop. Karma: Hmm. Overhead Map added to the Court Record. Karma: Testify to the court about your arrest. Now! Judge: W-w-wait! Mr. von Karma... Karma: Yes? Judge: Actually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings... Karma: Wrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word \"guilty.\" That is your role! Judge: Y-yes, of course. You're quite right. Phoenix: (No, he's not!!!) Witness Testimony -- The Arrest of Edgeworth -- Gumshoe: A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight. We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could. That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth. Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all. But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake. So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth. Judge: Hmm... I see. Very well... Karma: Begin your cross-examination, attorney. Now! Judge: ... Cross Examination -- The Arrest of Edgeworth -- Gumshoe: A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You received a call from a \"man\"? Gumshoe: Er... yup. Phoenix: But you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right? Karma: Karma: That woman and the \"man\" who called in the report are two different people, obviously! Phoenix: Different people? Karma: There were two witnesses! Phoenix: (Urk!) Karma: Their testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping. Phoenix: (The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.) Karma: What happened next, Detective? Gumshoe: We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake? Gumshoe: Er, well... I'd say it was about three minutes. Phoenix: That's pretty fast! Gumshoe: Our motto for the month is \"get there quick.\" Karma: Karma: Detective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets! Gumshoe: Y-yessir! Sorry, sir! Karma: Do that, and you'll be able to look forward to your next salary review. Gumshoe: So much to look forward to, these days... Karma: This is no time for daydreaming! Continue! Gumshoe: Y-yessir! Gumshoe: That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then? Gumshoe: Well... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really. Karma: Karma: Detective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts! Gumshoe: Y-y-yessir! Phoenix: (Man, he's got his share of objections...) Gumshoe: Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why didn't you think he was suspicious? Gumshoe: You should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors. Karma: Karma: Detective! The court isn't interested in your musings! \"Deep\"? \"Trusting\"? Poppycock! I've never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force! Gumshoe: Mmph! Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe doesn't look so good...) Karma: Continue! Now! Gumshoe: But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you find any clues on the body? Gumshoe: A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally. Karma: Judge! Here's the bullet... It didn't strike bone, so its shape is well preserved. Judge: Very well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence. Pistol Bullet added to the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you find any clues on the body? Gumshoe: A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally. Gumshoe: So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: W-why is that? Gumshoe: Well, we found the murder weapon in the boat. Phoenix: The murder weapon...? Gumshoe: A pistol. Judge: Detective Gumshoe... That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony. Gumshoe: Right! S-sorry, Your Honor. Changes statement from \"So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\" to \"The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.\" Gumshoe: The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"? Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Phoenix: (Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...) Gumshoe: There were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Judge: Order! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!? Gumshoe: Y-yes, Your Honor. Karma: Judge! This is the weapon in question. Judge: A-accepted into evidence. Pistol added to the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: What about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"? Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Phoenix: (Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...) Gumshoe: There were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Maya: Nick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague? Phoenix: I bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press. Maya: What do we do? Phoenix: Grit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do? Maya: Well said, Nick! You're the man! After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement: Karma: Members of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective! Gumshoe: Y-y-yessir! Karma: Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol? Gumshoe: Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol. Judge: Hmm... Maya: Hey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"? Karma: Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings! Maya: N-Nick! He's glaring at me! Karma: Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it. Judge: Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate. Karma: Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints! Judge: O-order! Order! Phoenix: (This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!) Karma: Well, Judge? Judge: I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However... Karma: You wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge! Judge: Y-yes? Karma: What are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now! Judge: B-but, wait, I... Karma: Just bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man! Judge: Y-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess. Phoenix: (Who's running this court, anyway!?) December 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2 Phoenix: Edgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon! Edgeworth: Uh... hmm... Phoenix: And that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo! Edgeworth: True... Phoenix: Was that you in the boat? Edgeworth: ... Yes. It was me. Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: But... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him. Phoenix: Th-then who did!? Edgeworth: I... don't know. Phoenix: You don't know!? Weren't you right there!? Edgeworth: ... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself! Phoenix: Y-you mean it was a suicide!? Edgeworth: ... That's the only explanation I can come up with. Phoenix: Huh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya? Maya: Huh? Wh-what? Phoenix: Any progress with Mia? Maya: Oh... Sorry. It's no good. Phoenix: Ugh... Maya: I know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right? No, I need you here Phoenix: No, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right? Maya: It's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better. Leads to: \"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\" Yeah, you're useless Phoenix: Um, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!) Maya: It's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything. Your face said it for you. Phoenix: (Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I'm sorry. Maya: It's okay Nick. Leads to: \"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\" Maya: I don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits... Phoenix: Aww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out! Maya: Really...? Edgeworth: W-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart... Phoenix: Oh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!) Judge: Court is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness. Karma: Yes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand? Karma: Lotta Hart, you are a research student at a university? Lotta: That I am. Karma: Good. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand? Lotta: ... Y'all need to learn some manners. Karma: UNDERSTAND? Lotta: Y-yeah, I understand, I understand! Judge: Er... very well. Your testimony, please. Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon. I was in my car. I heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake. When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat. Then there was another \"bang\"... There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat. Karma: Enough. Lotta: Huh? Karma: Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence. Judge: W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately! Karma: As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!! Judge: Order! Order! Order...! I will have order! Karma: ... Well, Judge? Judge: The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant... Phoenix: Phoenix: W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet! Karma: A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!? Phoenix: ...! Karma: Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court! Maya: Uh, Nick... contempt...? Phoenix: \"Contempt of court,\" you know? Maya: I... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony? I think there was Phoenix: I... think I noticed one little thing... Maya: Wow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on! Phoenix: Y-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...) Leads to: \"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\" I think there wasn't Phoenix: Honestly, I found nothing. Maya: I dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything! Phoenix: I bet von Karma probably fed her her lines. Maya: But... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will... Phoenix: He'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty. Maya: I guess we'll just have to bluff it. Phoenix: But if we mess up... contempt of court. Maya: Hey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt! Phoenix: Er... right. Leads to: \"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\" Phoenix: I understand... I will cross-examine the witness! Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Very well! Judge: I pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Just after midnight,\" you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day! Lotta: Huh? Uh, yeah, well, yes. Karma: Karma: I know you want to find contradictions, but really! Phoenix: Mmmph. Judge: I hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial. Lotta: I was in my car. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why were you camping there, anyway? Lotta: I'm a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research. Phoenix: (What research? This all sounds suspicious...) Press further Phoenix: Ms. Hart. Could you be more specific about your \"research\"? Karma: Karma: What does the witness's motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer \"is nothing\"! I object to this line of questioning! Objection sustained! Judge: W-w-wait, now, I'm the one who says that! Karma: Well, then say it already! Judge: Objection sustained. Phoenix: (Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...) Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (I think I'll let that one slide for now.) Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: I heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you weren't looking at the lake at that time? Lotta: Nope. I looked after I heard that noise. Karma: Karma: She's said that already! I asked you to find \"contradictions\"! Not leisurely chat with the witness! Phoenix: (Urk...) Lotta: When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Could you clearly see the two men? Lotta: Just look at the picture! Clear enough for you? Phoenix: (Uh oh...) Press further Phoenix: Wait a second! I wasn't asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men! Lotta: Uh, yeah, well, of course... Karma: Karma: The witness has testified that she saw them! There's also a photo! You'd best look elsewhere for your precious contradictions! Phoenix: (He jumped in quick... He's hiding something!) Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (I think I'd best let that one slide...) Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: Then there was another \"bang\"... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Were you watching the very moment the shot rang out? Lotta: Well, yeah, sure... Karma: Karma: You're asking meaningless questions! Meaningless! \"Contradictions,\" Mr. Wright. Not meaningless babble! Phoenix: (von Karma, I think I hate you. He's trying to keep me from talking to the witness... To what end...?) Lotta: There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure about that? Lotta: Yeah, sure as a country gal can be! Phoenix: (That sounds pretty sure.) Press further Phoenix: How come you're so sure? Lotta: Well, heck, I scanned the whole lake. Phoenix: (\"Scanned the whole lake\"? It almost sounds like she was more interested in the lake than the boat...) Ms. Hart... you-- Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! The witness has answered the question in full. Phoenix: Mmph! Karma: No need for further questions! Objection sustained! Judge: U-uh, that's what I'm... Karma: Sustained! Judge: Y-yes, of course. Phoenix: (Oh great... What am I supposed to do now?) Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (Lotta seems pretty sure of herself. I'd better not forge blindly ahead here. Still... this whole thing stinks.) Leads back to cross-examination Phoenix: (Th-there weren't any contradictions in there!) Maya: Sorry, Nick. If only my sister were here... Phoenix: (Maya's really taking this hard.) After selecting \"Press further\" upon pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements, and pressing fifth statement: Judge: Enough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting. Phoenix: B-but, Your Honor! Karma: You keep your promise! Judge: Mr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court! Karma: And if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...? Phoenix: Uh... uh huh. Maya: Nick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy! Phoenix: I... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do? Judge: I believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision. Karma: Then, pass your judgment! Judge: Very well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand. ???: Judge: Wh-who was that!? Maya: It... was me. Phoenix: (Maya!) Judge: I-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities? Maya: No, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death! Lotta: ...! Maya: Lotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!? Judge: You will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst! Maya: Answer me, Lotta! Lotta: What's the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth... Karma: Karma: Enough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court! Judge: Y-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave. Phoenix: (No... No...!) Wait! Maya: I-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent! Karma: Hah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Wrong Phoenix: Wrong! Karma: What!? Leads to: \"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\" Right Phoenix: (Dammit, he's right...) Maya: N-Nick! There must be something we can do! Phoenix: I... don't think there is. The cross-examination is over already! Maya: B-but... but didn't Lotta just say she saw him? She did, Nick! She just said that she saw Mr. Edgeworth! She didn't say that in her testimony, did she? Phoenix: ...! Y-you're right! Your Honor! Leads to: \"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\" Phoenix: Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Karma: You're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection! Judge: ... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot. Karma: What!? Judge: Ms. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again. Karma: B-but he is in contempt of court! Maya: No, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me! Judge: Hmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately. Maya: Nick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck! Phoenix: M-Maya...! Karma: Peh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses! Phoenix: (I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...) Judge: Mr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination! Cross Examination -- That Last Statement -- Lotta: I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, what about the other man? Karma: Karma: You cannot expect to be allowed to blithely ignore your promise, Mr. Wright! I believe you claimed there was a contradiction in the witness's testimony! Well, find it! If you can! Judge: Mr. Wright, I have to assign you a penalty. Phoenix: (Damn...!) Present Lake Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Got you.\" Phoenix: (That's it...? Uh oh. I don't know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?) Phoenix: Got you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally! Lotta: Wh-what!? You got what? Phoenix: Look at this photograph. Lotta: The photo I took...? Phoenix: The very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart. Lotta: So... so? Phoenix: This picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!? Lotta: Whut!? Wha--! Judge: Mr. Wright has a point! Karma: Karma: That's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please! Phoenix: Yet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself! Judge: Ms. Hart. Lotta: What! Judge: Could you see the defendant that night? Lotta: O-of course! I said I could and I meant I could! Judge: Then, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting. Phoenix: (I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!) Witness Testimony -- How Edgeworth Was Seen -- Lotta: Yer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits. So, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car. Still, I brought my binoculars with me. When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars. See? No problem! Judge: Hmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (This one'd better be good!) Cross Examination -- How Edgeworth Was Seen -- Lotta: Yer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So? How could you see Edgeworth!? Lotta: Now, just hold your horses for a second! You hasty Yankee types'd never find a gal where I'm from. Judge: Defense attorneys have trouble with that as it is. Phoenix: (Nobody loves me...) Lotta: So, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Your \"camera\"...? Lotta: Yeah. It's got an automatic... Karma: Karma: The issue we are concerned with here is Ms. Hart seeing Mr. Edgeworth! The camera has nothing to do with this at all! Judge: Objection sustained. Phoenix: (Argh! He's not letting her answer any of my questions!) Lotta: Still, I brought my binoculars with me. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Binoculars\"? Lotta: Yeah, binoculars. Phoenix: Yesterday, you mentioned that you were out looking for shooting stars, correct? Lotta: Well... yeah. Phoenix: Wouldn't you need a telescope, not binoculars, for that? Lotta: ...! Phoenix: I've got doubts about your camera, too! Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers? Karma: Karma: The camera is irrelevant to this case! Phoenix: You can't say that for certain! Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright. Is the camera really relevant to this case? If you believe it is, you may continue with this line of questioning. Karma: But know this! If you find nothing with this, there will be consequences! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Do you wish to press further about the camera? Press further Phoenix: (This is make-it-or-break-it time!) The camera is of utmost importance, Your Honor. It is, perhaps, the key to this entire case! Therefore, I will continue my line of questioning! (Wow! Maybe I went a little overboard there...) Judge: Very well! Ms. Hart! You will testify to the court about the camera! Lotta: Yeah, yeah, I hear ya. Changes statement from \"Still, I brought my binoculars with me.\" to \"The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.\" Hold back Phoenix: Okay, Your Honor... I withdraw my question. (I have to remember who I'm dealing with! I bet von Karma wants to trap me so he can put me in contempt! I think I'll hang back for now and see what happens.) Karma: Hah! Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Hart. What made you choose that lake to photograph meteors? You know the fog gets thick on that lake. It's not very suited to stargazing. Lotta: Yeah, well... Y'see, I... I guess I wasn't thinking too straight! Har! Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness because of her challenged intellect! Lotta: Now wait a minute! Karma: Continue your testimony. You were saying how it was that you saw Edgeworth? Lotta: Grr... Karma: No unnecessary comments, please. Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Phoenix: You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie! Lotta: S-says who!? Phoenix: I saw the camera you set up yesterday. It was pointed directly at the lake! You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! Leads to: \"Ooof!\" Present Lake Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie! Lotta: S-says who!? Phoenix: Take a look at this photograph. This was taken on an automatic setting, was it not? Lotta: Y-yeah, that's right. Phoenix: You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! But, as this photograph clearly shows... The camera was pointed directly at the lake! Leads to: \"Ooof!\" Lotta: When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: If there was a heavy fog, how would binoculars change that at all? Lotta: What do you mean? Phoenix: Even binoculars can't see through fog! But... you say you clearly saw him? Lotta: Er... I did... yeah. Karma: Enough! There is no room for doubt in her testimony! Phoenix: (Hmm. She sounded pretty doubtful to me! But... I have to find a clear contradiction first.) Phoenix: (I don't care how many von Karmic objections I get... I'm going to find a hole in this testimony if it's the last thing I do!) Lotta: Ooof! Judge: Mr. Wright! What are you driving at? Phoenix: The witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor! Lotta: ...! Judge: W-well then, what exactly was she photographing? Show evidence Leads to: \"Your Honor! Take a look at this...\" I don't know Phoenix: Well... that I don't know. Karma: Karma: What the witness takes photos of is entirely her business! This has nothing to do with the case! Not to mention that you can't even show us another reason why she might have been there. Mr. Wright... If you are out of material, I suggest we end this mockery of a cross-examination. Phoenix: (Uh oh... I can't let the trial end like this! I have to show them something!) Leads to: \"Your Honor! Take a look at this...\" Phoenix: Your Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake? Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Your Honor? What do you think? Judge: I... think I'm confused. Karma: Wrong again, Mr. Wright. So very wrong. You can't get through this one with your weak bluffs! Phoenix: Y-Your Honor! Enough playing around! Here's the real evidence! Judge: \"Enough playing around\" is my line, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Uh... Leads back to: \"What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?\" Phoenix: Ms. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph! Judge: What's this? A newspaper article? \"Gourdy\"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake... Phoenix: Well, Ms. Hart? Lotta: I... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this \"Gourdy.\" I don't have proof Phoenix: Well, I don't have proof... Karma: Karma: Bah! Your ineptitude is entertaining, Mr. Wright, but enough is enough! I've had enough of baseless claims made without a hair of evidence to support them! Phoenix: Phoenix: Well all right, if that's how you want to play... I'll show you evidence! Judge: Mr. Wright! Are you sure about this? Phoenix: (I'm sure sick of that smarmy prosecutor putting me down! Or... did he taunt me so I'd get mad and make a mistake?) Leads to: \"Very well, let's see it.\" I have proof Phoenix: I have it! Proof! Judge: Hmm... Intriguing! Leads to: \"Very well, let's see it.\" Judge: Very well, let's see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster! Present Lotta's Camera Phoenix: Phoenix: The proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera! Lotta: ...! Phoenix: You camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake. Lotta: ... Phoenix: And here, this article about \"Gourdy.\" According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren't you! That's why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises! Leads to: \"Order! Order!\" Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Phoenix: The proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster! Lotta: ...! Phoenix: According to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that's how you got this picture when the pistol fired! Leads to: \"Order! Order!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here's my proof! It's simple! Judge: ... If it's simple... then why have you obviously made an error, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Urk...? Lotta: What's that!? Karma: Go home. Consider a career change. Phoenix: (Gah! How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.) Judge: Luckily for you, I'm in a patient mood, Mr. Wright. One more time please. Leads back to: \"Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!\" Judge: Order! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange. Phoenix: (Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you? Lotta: ... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what? Phoenix: Huh...? Lotta: That don't change what I saw, does it? Karma: Exactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist! Lotta: H-hey! Karma: But, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing! Phoenix: (Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!) Judge: Ms. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony. Lotta: ... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though. Phoenix: (Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!) Karma: ... Witness Testimony -- Lotta's New Testimony -- Lotta: Actually, I'm not a research student at a university. I'm an investigative photographer. Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster! That's why I was camping out by the lake. But, that's all I was hiding. When I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake. There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time. Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot. I was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry. Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness. Karma: Karma: The witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination! Judge: Er... hmm. Phoenix: Phoenix: I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?) Judge: Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind. Karma: Hah! That would be a first! Phoenix: (Hah hah, very funny.) Judge: You understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- Lotta's New Testimony -- Lotta: Actually, I'm not a research student at a university. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then what manner of person are you!? Lotta: I'm not sure I'm high-falutin' enough to be called a \"manner\" of anything. Lotta: I'm an investigative photographer. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: An \"investigative photographer\"? Lotta: Yep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It's that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister's graduation last year... N' guess what! Phoenix: Umm... what? Lotta: There was a yoofoh just a' hanging in the sky! Phoenix: A \"yoofoh\"...? Lotta: You know, an \"Unidentified Flying Object\"? A yoofoh! That's when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer! Phoenix: I... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...) Lotta: Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is \"Gourdy\" really all that newsworthy? Lotta: Heck yeah! They even had him up on the TV! Phoenix: (I'm not sure that appearing on the local news \"rumor of the month\" show qualifies. Last month's show was \"Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill,\" I believe.) Lotta: Hey! They also had a picture of him in the newspaper! For real! Judge: Mr. Wright. This is one fight I do not believe you can win. Let's keep moving, shall we? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Lotta: That's why I was camping out by the lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That's why you put the automatic senior on your camera? Lotta: Yep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a \"bang!\"... Phoenix: It snaps a shot. Lotta: Yep. Phoenix: So, how many pictures has it taken so far? Lotta: The only time the camera triggered was that night. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Lotta: But, that's all I was hiding. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake. Lotta: Heck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake'd be swarmin' with competitors! Phoenix: Competitors...? Lotta: Yeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop! Phoenix: Ah... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth? Lotta: W-well, actually... Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! I'll not have you asking questions with no relevance to this case!!! Phoenix: (Whatever you say, von Karma. I know you told her to keep quiet.) Lotta: When I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Exactly what sort of sound was it? Lotta: Well, I never heard one before so I can't say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot. It was a lot sharper a sound than I would have expected. Phoenix: (Hmmm...) Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart!\" Lotta: There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There wasn't \"much else to look at\"? Lotta: Yep. Phoenix: (I dunno. If she heard a bang... and she thought Gourdy was out there... I kind of doubt she'd waste any time looking at a boat.) Lotta: What? What did I do now? What're you giving me that look for? Phoenix: (Definitely suspicious... Maybe it's time for some evidence...) Karma: Witness! Continue. Lotta: Hold your hushpuppies, pops, I'm getting there. Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart!\" Lotta: Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there nothing on the lake but the boat at that time? Lotta: Huh? Wait, so you're thinking maybe he was shot from some other place? I don't think so, nope. The lake was smooth as glass, and nobody was on the shore, neither. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Present Gourdy Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart!\" Phoenix: (I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!) Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!? Lotta: W-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it! Phoenix: I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal! Lotta: Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!? Phoenix: You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought! Lotta: Aah! Judge: Order! Continue, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing! Lotta: ...! ... ... Phoenix: Well!? Lotta: Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all... Judge: M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then? Lotta: ... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now. Judge: ... This... this is totally uncalled for-- Lotta: B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof! Judge: Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this. Lotta: Right! Right! That's why I took this photo n'... Karma: Karma: Witness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole. Lotta: Sh-shut my what!? Phoenix: (What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...) Gumshoe: She even had a photograph to prove it. Phoenix: But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting. Gumshoe: That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\" Phoenix: (She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?) Make her show the enlargement Leads to: \"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph.\" Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (If this is a trap... I'd better hold back and see how things go. But... if I wait now, the cross-examination will be over! Can I really risk that!?) Do nothing Judge: This hereby ends the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart. Karma: And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time. Judge: Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add? Karma: I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required? Judge: Nothing, of course. Phoenix: (Oh no! I should have pressed further!) Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Game over Rethink position Phoenix: (I have to fight now or I could lose everything!) Leads to: \"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph.\" Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not? Lotta: Y-yeah! I did! Phoenix: Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!? Karma: Karma: B-because it does not exist! Lotta: What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool! Judge: What's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma! Karma: Er... erm... Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement! Karma: Karma: The prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence! Judge: Objection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court. Lotta: Here it is. Judge: Hmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence. Lake Photo added to the Court Record. Karma: Happy now, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Hmm... (There has to be something!) Karma: You asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it! Judge: Hmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination... Karma: Is over! Obviously! Judge: Then, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart. Karma: And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time. Judge: Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add? Karma: I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required? Judge: Nothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict. Phoenix: (Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?) Object to the enlargement Leads to: \"Your Honor!\" Show other evidence Phoenix: W-wait! Your Honor, This evidence... Karma: Karma: I believe we have spent enough time talking about evidence! Judge: Hmm... indeed. We've heard opinions on every piece of evidence but this enlargement. I see no point in retracing our steps. Leads back to: \"This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?\" Wait and see Phoenix: (Uh oh... think of something! No good... I guess I'll just sit back and see how this turns out.) Judge: Very well! Allow me to state my verdict. Phoenix: (Oh no! I should have pressed further!) Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Game over Phoenix: Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement! Judge: W-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is \"strange\"? Phoenix: (Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.) Present shooter's hand or pistol Phoenix: Leads to: \"Here, Your Honor!\" Present shooter Phoenix: Phoenix: Here, your honor! Judge: The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange? Can you be more specific? Phoenix: (Specific, right...) Leads back to: \"I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here, Your Honor! Judge: Where...? Mr. Wright, I understand you're in a tight spot. However! You have nothing to gain by making baseless claims of faulty evidence! Phoenix: Y-Your Honor! Never mind that... my, my finger slipped! Please let me show you again! Judge: Hmm... Leads back to: \"I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.\" Phoenix: Here, Your Honor! Judge: The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange? Phoenix: Look at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor! Judge: The hand...? Phoenix: That hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence! Judge: This man's left hand does what...!? Phoenix: Let me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts! Present Pistol Phoenix: Leads to: \"The evidence is clear.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Hmm... I'm not sure this warrants a \"take that!\" I'd better think this one through!) Judge: Mr. Wright, please hurry up. We haven't got all day. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor! Right away! Leads back to: \"I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!\" Phoenix: The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's \"right hand\"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!! Judge: Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Judge: You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim? Karma: Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!? Ms. Hart Phoenix: Who else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart! Judge: Wh-what!? Do you have proof of this!? Phoenix: (Proof-shmoof! Always with the proof! Oh... wait, I do need proof, don't I.) Judge: Mr. Wright! I'll have you remember this is a court of law! Phoenix: (Uh oh. The Judge is mad.) Karma: Let me ask again! Leads back to: \"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?\" The victim himself Leads to: \"There is only one explanation remaining!\" Larry Phoenix: (Wait, wait--I can't do that. Sacrifice one friend to save another? What's the point!?) Karma: Well, Wright! Your answer! Leads back to: \"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?\" Phoenix: There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!! Judge: Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation. Judge: Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option. Karma: Karma: I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Karma: An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot. Phoenix: The... distance? Karma: The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away! Phoenix: A meter! Th-that's three feet! Karma: There is no way it could have been suicide! Judge: Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!? Karma: Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see. Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Karma: ... Judge: That is all. The court is adjourned. December 26, 1:15 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2 Phoenix: Whew, that was a close one. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: Hey! Don't you have anything to say!? Edgeworth: No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright. Phoenix: Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too! Edgeworth: ... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him! Phoenix: I was just kidding around. Edgeworth: Hmph. Phoenix: Look... I'm going to go check on Maya. Edgeworth: Oh... Wright. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: Tell her something for me. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: ... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all. Phoenix: (Would it kill you to just state how you really feel with a \"thanks\", Edgeworth?) (Changed from [Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!] in the original release) Phoenix: I requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the \"bang\" she heard. Lotta's Deposition added to the Court Record. To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Goodbyes Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 December 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Maya! Maya: Hey! Nick, it's you! I'm glad Mr. Edgeworth made it through the day okay. It's a relief... Phoenix: Hey. Why'd you do that, anyway? Maya: ... I don't know. I... just knew I had to do something. I know I'm not the lawyer my sister was... ... I'm sorry. Phoenix: Well, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay? Maya: O... Okay. Talk Questioning Phoenix: Have you been questioned yet? Maya: No... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said \"seeing as this is your first offense, we'll let you go after questioning.\" Phoenix: Whew... Maya: Oh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay? Phoenix: Huh? How much? Maya: I don't know. I guess they'll send you a bill or something. Phoenix: (Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word \"bail\"?) Mia Phoenix: Any luck with Mia...? Maya: None... I can't get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don't know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn't have stopped my training. Phoenix: (Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...) Maya: I wonder if I'll ever see my sister again... Present Attorney's Badge Maya: It must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say \"I'm a lawyer!\" But, spirit mediums, well... Phoenix: I dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you... Maya: But these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I'll ever be a proper medium... Lake Photo Maya: Isn't that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about? Phoenix: Uh huh. Maya: Huh... It's nice and big... but you can't really see the faces any clearer, can you? Misty Fey's Photo Maya: My... mother. ... Phoenix: (Now that I've shown her the picture, I'm not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I'm pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.) Gourdy Article Maya: I want to see Gourdy, too! Phoenix: If he really exists. Maya: Well, I'd say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let's get some fishing poles and go down to the lake! Phoenix: (Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...) Pistol Bullet Maya: So the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched? Phoenix: Hey, I'm surprised you remembered that! Maya: How could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings? Phoenix: I'm... not really sure. Pistol Maya: Mr. Edgeworth's prints are on this pistol, aren't they? Phoenix: Yes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting. Maya: What? Really!? Phoenix: (The shooter used his left hand, after all...) Anything else Maya: Sorry... I'm fresh out of ideas. December 26Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: ... Sure is quiet here with nobody around. Right... I have to get Maya out of that detention cell soon! December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe's not here...) Police: Gumshoe's at the scene again today. Phoenix: Huh? Oh, really? Police: He's a live wire that one. Got into a fight with the chief for not following protocol... Phoenix: (Not following protocol...? I bet he wouldn't help them build the case against Edgeworth...) Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"Don't do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: Wha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don't believe it! Phoenix: (He must be playing chess on the computer...) December 26Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: Apparently, Mr. Grossberg is on vacation today. Well, I guess I can come back tomorrow if I need anything. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read. Desk Phoenix: A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster. Vacant wall Phoenix: I guess Mr. Grossberg isn't getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him... Potted plant Phoenix: An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available. Table Phoenix: A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn. December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrance Phoenix: There are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today? Examine Trees Phoenix: I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a \"nature park.\" It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold. Sign Phoenix: The sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though. December 26Gourd LakePublic Beach Phoenix: Haven't seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance... Examine Lake Phoenix: The famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It's a pretty big lake, really. December 26Boat Rental Shop Phoenix: (Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.) Examine Shop Phoenix: A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder. Boats Phoenix: There are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock. December 26Gourd Lake Woods Phoenix: Hey, Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ... Phoenix: Yes? What about the trial? Gumshoe: Well, I was going to say \"good show,\" but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know? Phoenix: Er... thanks. Examine Camera Phoenix: Lotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen. Sign Phoenix: The sign says \"No Camping.\" Funny place to pick to pitch your tent. Campfire Phoenix: I wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit. SUV Phoenix: I don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here. Talk Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow? Gumshoe: It sounds like he's bringing in another witness! Phoenix: Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today... Karma: There were two witnesses! Phoenix: I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it? Gumshoe: S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information. Phoenix: (Right...) Prosecutor Edgeworth Phoenix: Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth. Gumshoe: What's up? Phoenix: Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before. Gumshoe: ... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident. Phoenix: The DL-6 Incident? Gumshoe: Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes. Maya Fey Phoenix: I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey... Gumshoe: Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release) Phoenix: Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?) Gumshoe: He was really grateful for what she did, you know. Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: I think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal! Lotta's Camera Gumshoe: That woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all... Phoenix: Still, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today. Gumshoe: Oh, huh, really? Phoenix: (Umm... you were at the trial, weren't you, Detective?) Robert's Autopsy Report Gumshoe: Robert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager. Lake Photo Gumshoe: I don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all! Phoenix: But Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat. Gumshoe: Then he's the one being shot, then! Phoenix: He seemed fine in court today... Gumshoe: ... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway? Phoenix: (All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...) Pistol Bullet Gumshoe: Yep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt. Phoenix: From a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat. Gumshoe: Hmm... Phoenix: What do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Hey, making something of things is your job! Phoenix: Er... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?) Pistol Gumshoe: Maybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal. Phoenix: Huh? How should I know!? Lotta's Deposition Gumshoe: Now, she heard two gunshots, right? Phoenix: But wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times! Gumshoe: What!? How's that possible!? Phoenix: Where was the third shot fired? Gumshoe: I wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something? Anything else Gumshoe: Sorry to disappoint you, pal. I'm drawing a blank. After clearing all Talk options: Gumshoe: I'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can. Phoenix: Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be? Gumshoe: Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount. Phoenix: What? Edgeworth...? Gumshoe: Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay? Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month's rent, too...) After clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake Woods: December 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: Hey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I'm free to go. Phoenix: Free at last, eh? Maya: Those interrogators were really mean! They were like \"okay, what did you do THIS time?\" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it? Phoenix: Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they? Maya: Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail. Phoenix: Thank Edgeworth. Maya: Huh? Phoenix: He posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did. Maya: Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick! Talk What to do Phoenix: What do you think we should do next? Maya: We're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy. Phoenix: ... Maya: I-I was kidding! Phoenix: Still, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there? Maya: Sure! Any ideas Phoenix: Have you noticed anything lately? Maya: Hmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean. Phoenix: I meant have you noticed anything about the case...? Maya: Well... Not much more than that, no. Phoenix: (She's probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.) Wright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great. Phoenix: Behave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay? Maya: Heh heh heh. Misbehaving's much more fun. Phoenix: It's not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again. Maya: ... Right. I'll behave. Phoenix: (Oh dear...) Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: I don't know! I've been in detention this whole time. I think I'll let you decide what we should do. Deal? Any ideas Phoenix: Well? Any thoughts you want to share? Maya: Well, I was detention all day. I think I'd like more time to think. Phoenix: (Poor Maya, she probably thought about Mia the whole time she was in there...) Present Anything Maya: Don't waste time showing me things! We have to get cracking on this case! You know the enemy has more tricks up his sleeve! He's bringing in another witness! December 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like Edgeworth is in questioning. Maya: Let's come back later. Phoenix: Guess so... December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrance Maya: There aren't many cops around today, are there? Phoenix: They're probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth. Maya: Mmm... Lotta: Hey y'all! Maya: Hey, it's Lotta! Lotta: Y'all really did it today... Phoenix: Wh-what did we do now? Lotta: Naw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind. Phoenix: Lotta... Lotta: So, you see, I want to make it up to y'all. Phoenix: \"Make it up\"...? Talk Today's trial Phoenix: What did you think of the trial? Lotta: To be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble. Maya: Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing. Lotta: Yeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder! Maya: Right! Phoenix: (You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...) Gourdy Phoenix: What about Gourdy? Lotta: Right! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom! Maya: All right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too! Phoenix: (Finish your spirit medium training first!) Making it up Phoenix: Lotta, what do you mean by \"making it up to us\"? Lotta: Well, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you. Maya: What!? Lotta: That von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it. Maya: Wh-what information!? Lotta: Now we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little \"exchange.\" Phoenix: E-\"exchange\"? Umm... I thought this was to \"make it up to us\"...? Lotta: Right! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you! Phoenix: ... Lotta: What!? Information don't come cheap, my friend! Maya: Uh... Lotta: Hey! I see you thinking \"my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are\"!!! It's written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I'm just the exception, okay? Well, what'll it be? We gonna deal, or not!? Maya: Wh-what should we do, Nick? Deal Phoenix: (We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much? Lotta: Huh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I'm not trying to rob the poor! Leads to: \"Huh?\" No deal Phoenix: I'm sorry... But I've no intention of dealing with you! Maya: Nor do we have any money, anyway! Lotta: You guys make a fine team, you know that? And I can tell you don't have any money, just look at those clothes! Leads to: \"Huh?\" Present Lotta's Camera Lotta: I'm thinking I should up the sensitivity of my camera mic. Y'all just be sure y'all don't sneeze or nothing when you're in my part of the woods! Phoenix: Right... Lake Photo Lotta: I'm glad I did that enlargement. Phoenix: No kidding. If we didn't have that, Edgeworth would be in prison now, or worse! Maya: There's never a lack of drama when you're on a case, is there, Nick? Lotta: What, are you always on the verge of horrible failure like this!? Phoenix: Umm... Lotta: Careful or the stress'll send you to an early grave. Phoenix: (Thanks for the cheerful message of support!) Gourdy Article Maya: Umm... uh... You know, I was wondering... Lotta: Yeah? Maya: What if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did? Lotta: Y'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn't make a hit story! I need a picture that screams \"I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!\" I can't turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y'all think I am? Phoenix: (The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn't see!) Anything else Lotta: Yep, I'd have to say I know exactly squat about that. Phoenix: (It's painfully easy to know when something doesn't catch Lotta's interest...) Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: The only fair exchange for information is... information! Listen good-- What I need from you is information about Gourdy! Maya: Whoa-whoa-whoa! G-Gourdy!? Phoenix: B-but Gourdy doesn't... I mean, Gourdy might not exist! Lotta: Then bring me proof that shows he don't! Phoenix: Uh... Lotta: I'll be keepin' watch from the car, okay? You see something, y'all come to me first, got it? Phoenix: O-okay... Lotta: Right! See y'all later! Phoenix: ... Maya: Okay, Nick, let's get hunting! Phoenix: H-hunting...? You don't seriously mean... Maya: Gourdy? I sure do! Phoenix: What about Edgeworth!? Maya: We're searching for Gourdy for him, Nick! Don't you get it!? Phoenix: (Okay... and how exactly do we search for a make-believe monster...? Maybe we can find a monster myth specialist?) December 26Gourd LakePublic Beach Phoenix: Wh-what's that? Maya: Th-the Steel Samurai, Nick. Butz: Yo! Maya! Phoenix: Larry! What the heck is that!? (Changed from [Larry! What the heck is this!?] in the original release) Butz: Oh, it was my girl Kiyance's idea... She was all \"if you like, put this here, it would be, like, really cool!\" Dude, she gave it to me along with the banner! Maya: Wow! That's really impressive she could find those for you! Butz: Well, she knows a lot of people. And that show's finished now, so she got 'em for free. Phoenix: Right... Examine Flags Phoenix: Those flags look sadly out of place here. Flapping listlessly back and forth in a cold wind under a cold sky... Maya: I dunno, I think it kind of gives the place a festival atmosphere. It reminds me of the \"War of the Eyeglasses\"! Phoenix: ...? The war of the what!? Maya: Huh? What? You mean, you don't know the War of the Eyeglasses? Phoenix: What the heck is it? Maya: Our local fair used to do it ever summer... Huh, I guess we were the only ones. Phoenix: (I ask again, what the heck is it!?) Steel Samurai inflatable Phoenix: Doesn't that Steel Samurai look a little out of place? I mean, it's so huge... I guess it's good advertising. Maya: ... Something about this Steel Samurai just doesn't work for me. Phoenix: Huh? Really? It looks pretty well made to me. Maya: Hmph. Still a novice, aren't you, Nick. Really... True connoisseurs like Cody and me don't fall for this kind of stuff. Phoenix: (These Steel Samurai fans are obviously in a league of their own...) Compressor Maya: What's this machine? Butz: That? That's a compressor. I use it to fill up that balloon there with air. Maya: Huh, neat. Butz: Just got it repaired yesterday! Man, what a drag that was. Talk Edgeworth Butz: Yo, Nick! What happened with Edgeworth? Phoenix: Well, we made it through the first day in court all right... I don't know how good our prospects are from here on, though. Butz: Huh. Maya: Hey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth's secret weakness? He's terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy! Butz: Huh? That's weird. I don't think he was ever like that in school. Maya: No? Really? Butz: Well, we were only in the same class for a year. He transferred schools pretty quickly... Maya: Transferred? Phoenix: (Right... when the DL-6 Incident happened. Doesn't look like Larry knows about it, though.) The big samurai Phoenix: Hey, Larry. What was that big... thing up there before? Butz: Huh? Oh, the big guy? I've had that for about a month, yeah. It's a big hit with the kids! Phoenix: Why wasn't it there yesterday? Butz: Huh? Huh!? Oh... right. Th-the compressor was busted. Maya: Compressor? Butz: Yeah--it's that little unit by my hotdog stand. That what I use to put air in the Steel Samurai! It broke a little while ago so I sent it in for repairs. Maya: Oh. And here I thought you'd inflated it by yourself. Present Gourdy Article Butz: That's the guy that\u2019s selling my dogs faster than I can cook 'em! Maya: Do you think Gourdy really exists? Butz: Nah, I think somebody probably saw something else that they just thought was Gourdy. But I'll keep selling Samurai Dogs until the truth's out! Anything else Butz: Sorry, Nick. I don't know much about that. I am a mere seller of hotdogs. December 26Boat Rental Shop Maya: ... It\u2019s always so quiet, here. I wonder if the boat shop is closed for good? Phoenix: Well, with the murder on the lake and all... They're probably just taking a vacation till it blows over. Maya: I get it. After clearing \"Making it up\" talk option in Gourd Lake Park - Entrance: December 26Gourd Lake Woods Lotta: Hey y'all! Well? Y'all find anything out about Gourdy? Maya: Umm... no, nothing. Lotta: Well, keep moving! It gets cold out here at nighttime. Maya: It is a little chilly... I... I think I have to sneeze! Lotta: Wh-whoa! No you don't! No sneezing!!! Maya: Whaaa-cho! klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik Maya: ... Lotta: I told y'all NO SNEEZING! See, I set the camera to respond to things a little softer than a \"bang.\" It'd trigger on one of von Karma's finger snaps now! Maya: Oh... I'm sorry. Lotta: Yeah, well, sorry's nice but what about my film!? Maya: Nick... pay the lady. Phoenix: (*sob*) Talk What happened Lotta: I learned something in today's trial, that's for sure. Testifyin' is serious business! That's why I decided not to talk about that case any more. Maya: Huh? Phoenix: Whoa--didn't you say you had information about the case!? Tell us that, at least! Lotta: Like I said... I'll trade it for the dirt on Gourdy! Gourdy Maya: What are you going to do if Gourdy doesn't exist? Lotta: I'll quit being an investigative photographer. Maya: What!? Lotta: After all, I only have one photo to my name so far... Maya: Was it a good one? Lotta: You bet... a yoofoh! Maya: A y-yoofoh...? Lotta: Anyway, if I can't get a career-making photo this time around... Then that's it! I'll quit and go back to school. Maya: Huh? So you really are a university student? Lotta: Yeah, well, I'm takin' a break for a bit. Maya: Right... Present Lotta's Camera Lotta: I gotta do what I gotta do to get me a picture of Gourdy! That's why I raised the sensitivity of my mic. Just... watch yourself from now on, okay? Maya: Sorry, sorry! December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Gumshoe: Hey there, pal. What's up? You look out of sorts. Wait... you didn't go and do something that's going to hurt Mr. Edgeworth's case again! Phoenix: What do you mean, \"again\"!? Gumshoe: Whatever, have a seat, pal. I'm here for you if you need anything. Besides money, that is. Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"You're under arrest! I have a warrant... You have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney...\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for making arrests. Talk The investigation Phoenix: How is the investigation proceeding? Gumshoe: It's not, really. We have another meeting coming up... We're supposed to talk about Mr. Edgeworth's motive... Maya: His motive? Gumshoe: See, Mr. Edgeworth's father died in the DL-6 Incident... And the guy who got the lone suspect declared innocent was the victim in this case... Robert Hammond. They're saying that's why Mr. Edgeworth shot him. Phoenix: (And Edgeworth never talks about his past... I bet they'll drag that out and hit him with it in court tomorrow, too...) Maya: Poor Edgeworth... Gumshoe: I gotta admit, it doesn't look good, pal. Gourdy Maya: Say, Detective Gumshoe. Do you know \"Gourdy\"? Gumshoe: The monster down in Gourd Lake? Not personally, no. Maya: Well... we're looking for it. (Changed from [Well... we're looking for him.] in the original release) Gumshoe: Huh!? Are you out of your minds!? Maya: Eeek! Gumshoe: You got time to go wild monster hunting!? How about doing a little questioning for me then!? Maya: Oh... Detective Gumshoe is scaring me, Nick. Phoenix: I told Detective Gumshoe about the deal with Lotta. Maya: Nick! Try telling him sooner next time! Phoenix: Er, sorry. Gumshoe: ... I see, pal. Sorry for shoutin' at you. ... Okay! I, Detective Gumshoe, will aid your search for Gourdy! Maya: H-huh!? Gumshoe: I'll loan you one of our newest secret weapons for finding evidence! Maya: Really!?

First, let me show 'em to you! These are our best and brightest! Introducing Secret Weapon No. 1: \"Missile\"! Maya: M-M-Missile? Gumshoe: He's a K-9 police dog, still in training! Missile! Missile! Here, boy... Missile: Woof. Gumshoe: Here he is. Maya: Hey, he's cute! Look, Nick! Cute dog! Phoenix: (A cute dog... And this will help us... how?) Missile: Woof. Gumshoe: Next, Secret Weapon No. 2... A fishing pole! Here, this is my own personal pole. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for a monster... Gumshoe: Yeah! Phoenix: How are we supposed to catch a whole sea monster with a fishing pole!? Gumshoe: Never know 'til you try, pal! Phoenix: ...! Gumshoe: Okay, this next one is the last one. Phoenix: (No, please, I'm already overwhelmed by our choices.) Gumshoe: Secret Weapon No. 3! A metal detector! Here. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for something alive. Gumshoe: Right! Phoenix: How are we supposed to find it with a metal detector!? Gumshoe: Hey, you never know! It might have been eating soda cans! Well, which will it be!? Maya: Umm... I can't make up my mind, Nick. They all seem so perfect! Phoenix: I can't make up my mind, either... for the totally opposite reason. (Oh well, I suppose it can't hurt to borrow one of them.) Borrow Missile Phoenix: Can we borrow Missile? Gumshoe: Sure thing, pal. Be good to 'im! Missile: Woof. Maya: He's sooooo cute! Phoenix: (Oh boy...) Borrowed K-9 unit Missile from Detective Gumshoe.

But I hear he's aptly-named, for what it's worth. Fishing Pole Gumshoe: It's funny, one day I woke up and I wanted a fishing pole. Maya: Do you like fishing? Gumshoe: I've never gone. I just wanted one so bad, I went out and bought it. I've never used it, actually. Phoenix: (Must have been one of those mid-life crisis things...) Metal Detector Gumshoe: As you can see, it's a metal detector. We use it to look for bullets in the ground. If you can find that monster with it, all the better! Phoenix: (I'm not so hopeful...) Gourd Lake Public Beach If Missile is added to the Court Record Maya: Hey, Nick... Phoenix: Hmm? Maya: Missile's been acting strangely... Phoenix: \"Missile\"? Oh, oh right.

(It's going to have to this time...) Present Missile Maya: Hey Larry! Look, it's Missile! Isn't he cute? Butz: K-keep that mutt away from me! What am I going to tell the big boss? Maya: There's a \"big boss\" in charge of your hot dog stand? Nick! Maybe the stand is a front for a mafia money laundering scheme!!! Phoenix: Maya... I think you should probably try to look a little sorry about what happened. Maya: Oh, right! Butz: Heh... My poor dogs... Fishing Pole Butz: You know, you can't catch many fish in this lake. Maya: I'm not after small fry. I'm after the biggest fry of them all... Gourdy! Butz: ... You really going to try to fish out a monster? Maya: To save Edgeworth, yes! Butz: ... Brings a tear to my eye, in more ways than one. Gourd Lake Woods If Fishing Pole is added to the Court Record Maya: Mmm. Okay, Nick, this looks like a good spot! Phoenix: A good spot... for what? Maya: Time to do some fishing! Phoenix: (She's serious...) Umm... What are you going to use for bait? Maya: Oh... Phoenix: Yeah. \"Oh.\" Maya: Mmm... Phoenix: I figured something like this would happen. We should have brought Missile along with us, too. At least then we'd have bait. Maya: ...!!! N-Nick...! How could you! Phoenix: I'm kidding! I'm kidding! Maya: Hmph! Some jokes are better left untold. Phoenix: (Oof! She hit me!) Maya: Okay... Watch this, Nick! Phoenix: Just try not to reel in any empty cans or boots, okay?

His name's \"Missile.\" Lotta: Huh. K-9s are the ones they use to sniff for things, right? I wonder what Gourdy smells like... Maya: Hmm... I hadn't thought about that. Fishing Pole Maya: Lotta, wait... For catching Gourdy... Lotta: A fishing pole!? Are you out of your doggone mind!? Maya: Yes! I mean... yes, it's a fishing pole! Lotta: Huh. I never thought of that! Good luck! Maya: Thanks! Phoenix: (I don't believe it...) Metal Detector Maya: Hey, Lotta, look at this: It's a metal detector! Lotta: I know what it is. Umm... I'm not sure that's going to pick up Gourdy, though. Unless he's been eating people's watches or spare change or something. Maya: Oh... I hadn't thought about that. Boat Rental Shop If Metal Detector is added to the Court Record *beep* *beep* *beep* Maya: N-Nick! It's beeping! The metal detector's found something! Phoenix: Sure it loud enough about it. (Whatever it is, it must be in those bushes...) Go check it out, Maya. Maya: Why do I have to check it out? ... Nick. Look! Phoenix: Huh...? An air tank? Huh. The valve looks broken. Maya: I thought it was Gourdy... Phoenix: Maya, first of all... Why would Gourdy be in the bushes!? And second of all, why would a metal detector react to a sea monster!? Maya: Oh. Phoenix: Huh? (There's something wrapped around this air tank... It looks like... a string of flags...?) Maya: Well, we might as well take it with us now that we've found it. Phoenix: (It's heavy...)

Detective Gumshoe isn't here... Maya: Now that you mention it, didn't he say he had a meeting to go to? Phoenix: Ah, that's right... Let's come back later. Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"Resistance is futile! We have you surrounded! It's not too late... Release the hostages and come out with your hands up.\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for negotiating a hostage situation. Gourd Lake Public Beach Talk The flying air tank (after selecting \"Is it yours?\", then \"To inflate something\", then \"Ask more about the tank\" upon presenting Air Tank) Maya: Umm... So, the tank and the Steel Samurai you were trying to fill up flew away... What happened next? Butz: Well, all that happened on the 20th or so. Phoenix: (The 20th... a week ago.) Butz: Now, as far as I could see, the tank went flying out into the lake. So I went out every night in a boat looking for it. I mean, Kiyance gave me that Steel Samurai after all! Maya: And when did you find it? Butz: Just the night before last! It flew way out there! Took me four whole days to find it. Phoenix: (The night before last... was the night of the murder!) Butz: Sorry for not telling you, Nick. Actually, I was here on the night of the murder. But, you see, I went home before midnight. Maya: So you didn't know about what happened? Butz: No... Maya: That's too bad... Phoenix: It's not all bad. We've solved one mystery at least. Maya: A mystery...? Phoenix: (Maybe we should go tell her...) Present Air Tank Butz: What? An air tank? What about it? Phoenix: Larry... I wanted to ask you about this tank... Have you seen it before? Phoenix: Have you seen this before? Butz: Huh? Me? N-no. Never. Who the heck would go diving in the middle of the winter! Phoenix: (There's something about the way his eye twitched when I showed him the tank... I think I'd better pursue this line of questioning a little further...) Leads back to Court Record Is it yours? Phoenix: Say... is this air tank yours? Butz: Wh-why would I have a thing like that? Phoenix: Look--see how there's a string of flags around the tank valve? It's just like the string of flags around your Steel Samurai there. Butz: ...! M-must be a coincidence! There's strings of flags everywhere these days! L-like elementary schools! A-and used car dealerships! L-look, why would I need a tank anyway!? To inflate something Phoenix: You used this to inflate that, didn't you? Butz: I-inflate what!? Phoenix: What else? That big puffy Steel Samurai! Butz: !!! ... N-now why would you go asking me a question like that. Phoenix: (Looks like I hit the nail on the head.) Butz: ... Right... right... Actually, umm... See, the compressor I always use was on the fritz. So I tried using the tank to inflate it, just once. And, er, it didn't go so well. Phoenix: (As I suspected!) Put the tank away Phoenix: (I guess I've gotten to the bottom of that mystery!) Butz: Heh. Sorry! Leads back to Court Record Ask more about the tank Phoenix: It \"didn't go so well\"? Butz: Er, yeah. Phoenix: Do you think you could be a little more specific? Butz: C-c'mon...  Look, it's embarrassing so I really don't want to talk about it... Maya: Tell us! Tell us! Butz: ... Fine. Whatever. It's like what I said, the compressor was busted. So I took the tank and tried to fill the Samurai up with that. And then... BLAAAAM! Butz: The valve busted open and made this incredible noise! And that tank there took off like a rocket. And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it! Maya: What!? Off into Gourd Lake? Butz: It sure scared me out of my gourd, that's for sure. Adds Talk option \"The flying air tank\" To go diving Phoenix: You used this to go diving in the lake, didn't you? Butz: Wh-wh-what!? Why the heck would I go diving in the lake!? Wait! You... you're not... You're not saying I had something to do with that murder!? Phoenix: N-no, not at all, just... Butz: Hey, you watch it buddy! I'm not saying anything until my lawyer gets here! Maya: Larry... Nick is your lawyer. Phoenix: Well, Larry? She's right. Butz: Bah! A-anyway, I never seen that air tank! Okay? Phoenix: (Yeah, right... Larry is hiding something, I can tell...) Leads back to Court Record Air Tank (after selecting \"Is it yours?\", then \"To inflate something\", then \"Ask more about the tank\" upon presenting Air Tank) Butz: See, I tried to use this tank to fill up the Samurai. I was attaching the tank, when it happened! BLAAAAM! Butz: The valve just busted open and the whole thing took off! The tank shot up in the air like a rocket... And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it! Man, what a sight that was. Maya: I wish I could have seen it! Phoenix: Me too. Gourd Lake Woods Talk Gourdy Lotta: Well, Mister Lawyer? I've got the info y'all need! Y'all got the scoop on Gourdy for me yet? Nothing yet Phoenix: It's not going to be that easy to find him, you know. Lotta: You'd better hurry or you won't have that info in time for the trial tomorrow! Phoenix: (Uh oh...) Leads back to Talk options We found him Phoenix: Huh? Gourdy? Oh, we found him already. Maya: What!? I haven't seen any monsters yet! Lotta: Y-y'all for real!? Gourdy really exists!? Wait! I need proof! You get a photo!? I have proof Phoenix: Of course I have proof. Maya: No fair, Nick! It was when I went to the bathroom, wasn't it!? That's when you made contact with Gourdy! Lotta: Enough jabbering already, let's see your proof! Present Air Tank (after clearing \"The flying air tank\" Talk option in Gourd Lake - Public Beach) Phoenix: Maya: Larry's air tank...? Lotta: What're y'all doing with an air tank? Phoenix: This... is Gourdy. Lotta: Umm... scuze me? Maya: Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick? Phoenix: There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud \"bang\" when it flew... Lotta: A \"bang\"...? Phoenix: The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo! Maya: Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!? Lotta: ... ... Well, that's a fine way to ruin a gal's dreams. Phoenix: I'm sorry, Lotta. Lotta: Nah, it's okay, you win. I'll give you your info, like I promised. Maya: Poor Lotta... Adds \"Case information\" Talk option Present anything else Phoenix: Lotta: ... Y'all trying to make a fool out of me? That don't prove diddly-squat! Maya: Hmph. We almost had her duped, too. Phoenix: (We need to do something soon or I won't get that information off of her!) Leads back to Talk options I have no proof Phoenix: I don't have it yet, but my lawyer instincts tell me the proof is out there. Lotta: Hah! Nice try, but y'all can't pull the wool over these eyes that easy! Maya: That won't work in court either, Nick... Phoenix: (Great, now they're both mad at me.) Leads back to Talk options Gourdy doesn't exist Phoenix: Lotta... There is no such thing as Gourdy. Lotta: Wh-what!? How can y'all be so sure! Maya: R-really, Nick!? Lotta: Y'all got some proof Gourdy don't exist!? Phoenix: The proof that Gourdy doesn't exist... Is here Phoenix: Of course I have proof. No lawyer worth his badge would make a claim without proof to back it up. Here's the proof that Gourdy doesn't exist... Present Air Tank (after clearing \"The flying air tank\" Talk option in Gourd Lake - Public Beach) Phoenix: Maya: Larry's air tank...? Lotta: What're y'all doing with an air tank? Phoenix: This... is Gourdy. Lotta: Umm... scuze me? Maya: Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick? Phoenix: There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there.

Adds \"Case information\" Talk option Present anything else Phoenix: Lotta: ... Hah! All that fancy talk about lawyers and proof had me going for a second there! Y'all better take a good hard look at that badge of yours and consider a career change! Phoenix: (Great, the \"investigative photographer\" is giving me career advice...) Leads back to Talk options Is out there somewhere Phoenix: I don't have it yet, but my lawyer instincts tell me the proof is out there. Lotta: Hah! Nice try, but y'all can't pull the wool over these eyes that easy! Maya: That won't work in court either, Nick... Phoenix: (Great, now they're both mad at me.) Leads back to Talk options Case information (appears after correctly presenting Air Tank upon selecting \"Gourdy\" Talk option) Leads to: \"So, tell us this \"information\" you have.\" Phoenix: So, tell us this \"information\" you have. Lotta: A promise is a promise, I guess... I overheard the cops around here saying something about the witness tomorrow... They said he's the caretaker of the boat rental place up the path here. Maya: Boat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted. Lotta: Just an old guy, living all by himself. Y'all should go check it out. Maya: Thanks, Lotta! We will! Let's get cracking, Nick! Lotta: Hold on. Phoenix: Something else? Lotta: Yeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know. Maya: ...! Wait... so you have another photo? Lotta: Well... Yeah, but there's nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn't be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it. Second Lake Photo added to the Court Record. Lotta: Bye now. Y'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave. Maya: ... Poor Lotta... Phoenix: It's all Larry's fault. The legend still lives on, I guess. Maya: The \"legend\"...? Phoenix: Yeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" Maya: Hmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape. December 26Boat Rental Shop Maya: Hey, Nick! This is the boat shop that Lotta was talking about! Phoenix: You're right. Doesn't seem to be anyone around at all. Maya: Well, let's go check it out anyway! December 26Caretaker's Shack Uncle: Meg! That you!? Maya: Eeeek! Uncle: Hey, is that Keith with you!? Where have you two been! I've been worried sick. Maya: ... N-Nick... you handle this. Phoenix: Uh, I think I'll leave this one up to you, Maya. Uncle: Meg! Maya: Y-yes!? Uncle: Finally made up your mind, have you? Meg: M-my mind? Uncle: You'll run the pasta shop when I'm gone? Maya: P-pasta? Uncle: Glad to hear it, glad to hear it! You make your old man proud. When you kids left the house, I didn't know what to think. How'm I supposed to keep this place running, an old man like me? Polly! The kids are home! Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Maya: N-Nick! What was that!? Phoenix: A parrot... the one on the perch. Uncle: Keith! Phoenix: Y-yes!? Uncle: I leave the \"Wet Noodle\" in your capable hands, sonny. Maya: N-Nick? What's the \"Wet Noodle\"? Phoenix: Um, based on the available evidence, I'd say it's the name of his pasta shop. Uncle: That's a relief, isn't it, Polly? Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Uncle: Ayup... ... *Zzzzz* Maya: He fell asleep... Phoenix: I guess he's relieved. Examine Stove Phoenix: Looks like a kitchen unit. It's pretty clean. Funny, he doesn't look like the type who'd keep things tidy like that. Maya: You're forgetting, Nick... He's running a pasta shop, here! Fish pictures Phoenix: Wow, there's lots of various fish in Gourd Lake, aren't there! Maya: ...? Something's funny, Nick. All these fish are saltwater fish. Fishing pole Phoenix: This fishing pole looks expensive. Table Maya: Look, Nick, he has an electric blanket on his table! Looks warm! That's a great idea, we should do that at the office. We can sit down with our clients, snug and warm, and drink hot cocoa! Phoenix: And what, talk about murders? Maya: Aw, you're a party pooper, Nick! Television Maya: Wow, he has a television in here, too. Safe Maya: Look, a little safe! Hmm... ... It's locked. Parrot Maya: Wow... what an amazing parrot that is. Good morning! Parrot: \"...\" Maya: Hello! Parrot: \"...\" Maya: He ignored me! Uncle: </nowiki>*</nowiki>Zzzzz* What, you forgot, Meg? You gotta call her name first! Maya: Her name? Uncle: Polly! How ya been!? Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Uncle: See? Maya: Neat! So the parrot's name is \"Polly\"! Parrot added to the Court Record. Maya: Too bad all she can say is \"hello\"... Uncle: Har har har! Old Polly can say lots of things! You just need to know the secret words! Maya: The \"secret words\"...? Parrot (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Maya: Wow... what an amazing parrot that is. Good morning! Parrot: \"...\" Maya: Hello! Parrot: \"...\" Maya: He ignored me! Uncle: What, you forgot, Meg? You gotta call her name first! Maya: Her name? Uncle: Polly! How ya been!?

Parrot: \"Pol-ly!\" *squawk* Maya: Hee hee! Cute! Phoenix: (Maya's found a new friend.) Talk The pasta restaurant Uncle: *Zzzzz* Phoenix: Umm... a pasta shop? Uncle: Ayup! To think, the \"Wet Noodle,\" will live on when I'm gone! My father started it you know. So that makes you two the third generation! Meg... Maya: Y-yes! Uncle: Tomorrow, we'll start with the secrets of dough tossin'! Maya: D-dough tossing? Uncle: You, too, Keith. Phoenix: Y-yes? Uncle: You'll be the best pasta wrangler the west has ever seen! Maya: P-pasta wrangler? The west? I-isn't pasta from Italy? Uncle: Meg! Maya: Y-yes! Uncle: You know the best pasta's always been made west of the Rockies, don't you? Phoenix: R-right, of course. Everybody knows that. Maya: Nick...? Phoenix: Huh? Maya: How long do we have to keep up this all-in-the-family charade? Phoenix: (This old man must know something about the murder...! We're not leaving until we find out what that is.) The pasta restaurant (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: Umm... a pasta shop? Uncle: Ayup!

We're not leaving until we find out what that is.) The boat rental shop Uncle: *Zzzzz* Phoenix: Umm... this is a boat rental shop, right? Uncle: What're you talking about!? This here's the palace of pasta, the \"Wet Noodle\"! Though, now that you mention it, we haven't gotten many orders for spaghetti lately. All the kids come up and say \"Yo dude, we wanna ride in one of your boats!\" That's why I keep them boats out there. Youngsters these days... Darned if I understand 'em! Phoenix: I'm pretty confused myself. Maya: Nick... This isn't going anywhere. Phoenix: But this old man is the witness tomorrow, right? We've got to find some way of getting information out of him!

Polly (appears after examining parrot) Uncle: *Zzzzz* Ack, my memory's gotten worse of late. That's why I just tell everything important to old Polly here. Maya: Everything... important? Hmm, I wonder... Polly! What's the number to the safe!? Parrot: \"... 1228!\" *squawk* Maya: Alright! Uncle: H-hey! Polly! Watch it, will ya! Maya: Heh heh. See, Nick? All it takes is a little clever thinking! Phoenix: (And a criminal mind...) Maya: Quick, Nick! Write that number down! Phoenix: H-hey! Don't get me involved in your little heist schemes. Polly (appears after examining parrot; after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: Ack, my memory's gotten worse of late. That's why I just tell everything important to old Polly here.

What you saw (appears after presenting Attorney's Badge, then presenting Lake Photo) Uncle: I forget the time, but it was pretty dark outside... probably night, ayup. Phoenix: (It was after midnight, but okay...) Uncle: Then I heard this \"bang!\" So I looked outside. Then I heard another one. \"Bang!\" A little while later, this boat comes back. Then a young man walked by my window here. He was mutterin' something to himself, ayup. Maya: What did he say? Uncle: ... Ayup... ... I forgot. I'll remember tomorrow by court time, promise. Maya: We need to know earlier than that...! Present Attorney's Badge Uncle: *Zzzzz* ...! That a lawyer's badge? Phoenix: Y-yes, it is! (I don't believe it! This old guy is the first person to recognize my badge!) Uncle: ... I get it. Phoenix: Huh? Uncle: Ayup... I got you figured out now! You're not Keith! Phoenix: ... Maya: N-Nick!  Now's our chance to clear things up! Phoenix: Umm... sir. No, I'm not Keith. Maya: And I'm not Meg, either! Uncle: ... Phoenix: We're here investigating a murder that took place on this lake the other night. Maya: Please, help us! Uncle: ... Hmm... a lawyer, huh? Maya: Please, mister... Uncle: Alright, I'll help. But, on one condition. Maya: What's that? Uncle: When this case is over and done... You'll run the \"Wet Noodle\"! Promise to run the Noodle Leads to: \"Okay, we promise.\" We can't promise that Phoenix: I can't make that promise. Uncle: ... I-is that any way to treat your old man!? Bah! You want me help? You've come to the wrong man! Maya: Uh oh... now he's grumpy. Phoenix: Not to mention he still thinks we're his kids. (Maybe we should just lie and say we'll run his shop?) Leads to: \"Okay, we promise.\" Phoenix: Okay, we promise. Maya: N-Nick! Are you sure about this? Phoenix: Hey, anything to get the case solved. Also... Who wouldn't want to eat \"Phoenix Noodles\"? Maya: I... guess so. Uncle: That's my boy! Good for you, Keith. Phoenix: W-wait, didn't I just say... Uncle: You, too, Meg! Maya: Y-yes!? Uncle: Heh heh heh... you bring a tear to your old man's eye, you know. Now, what was that you wanted to know? Speak up, Polly! Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Maya: Er... Phoenix: (Now he's talking to the bird again! How do we get him to talk to us!?) Attorney's Badge (subsequent times) Uncle: You won't be needing that badge to run a pasta shop. Toss it. Phoenix: Uh, um, I think I'll hold on to it if you don't mind. Anything (before presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: *Zzzzz* Now, listen here, Keith. Remember that tricolor pasta we were talking about? Our \"Rainbolioli\"! I figured out the last color we should use! Indigo Blue! Maya: Indigo... Blue? Phoenix: (That didn't seem to work the way I thought it might.) Gourdy Article (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: You know about Gourdy? Uncle: Nope. Lake Photo (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: Ayup, I seen this. Phoenix: Y-you know something about this, sir!? Uncle: Keith. Phoenix: Y-yes? Uncle: It's okay. You can call me Dad. Phoenix: ... D-Dad! You know something about this!? Uncle: Ayup. The other night... out on the lake... Maya: Yes? Yes!? Uncle: I know all about that! I seen it. Maya: Whaaaat!? Tell us! Tell what you saw! Uncle: Well, I suppose. Since you're taking over the shop and all... Parrot (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: Polly here's my only friend in the world. Isn't that right, Polly? Parrot: \"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk* Uncle: Ayup. Anything else (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Uncle: ... *Zzzzz* Phoenix: (He fell asleep...) Uncle: *Zzzzz* *mmph* After clearing \"Polly\" and \"What you saw\" Talk options: Uncle: You know what? Eh? Little Terry was just here. Phoenix: \"Terry\"...? Uncle: Ayup, that kid next door. You always used to make him cry, remember? He was wearin' this tattered old coat. Got himself some whiskers growing out of his face. Phoenix: (He must be talking about Detective Gumshoe...) Uncle: He comes up and tells me to come down to court tomorrow. Maya: Really...? Phoenix: (Somehow I don't think we're going to get much useful information out of this guy.) Maya... maybe we should be leaving. Maya: I think you're right. Oh, wait--I had one more question. Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something? Parrot: *squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Maya: H-huh!? What did she just say, Nick? Phoenix: One more time, Polly! Parrot: \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Phoenix: (What!? The DL-6 Incident?) Hey, mister! I-I mean, Dad! Uncle: *Zzzzz* Phoenix: (This is getting weird... Who IS this old guy!?) Boat Rental Shop Maya: Why would that bird Polly know about DL-6...? Phoenix: We have to figure out who that old man is. Maya: Oh... Phoenix: What? Maya: He locked the door, from the other side. Phoenix: (... Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this DL-6 Incident... Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe.) After clearing \"Polly\" and \"What you saw\" Talk options in Caretaker's Shack: December 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs Gumshoe: Hey, pal! Long time no see! ... You don't look so happy. What's wrong this time? Phoenix: Actually, we wanted to ask you something... Gumshoe: Yeah? Examine Detective Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Police: \"I... I'm not gonna make it... Just... just arrest that guy for me... please... uggh!\" Phoenix: ... He must be doing image training for dying in action. Talk The boat caretaker Phoenix: You know the boat rental shop down at Gourd Lake? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah... Phoenix: The old man who runs it is appearing as a witness in court tomorrow, right? Gumshoe: Huh...!? How'd you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret. Maya: Do you know who that old man is, Detective? Gumshoe: ... Actually... I don't. He's a bit of an odd bird... I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn't persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That's why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea. Maya: Hmm... sounds suspicious! Gumshoe: Hmm... The DL-6 Incident Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, please, help us... Gumshoe: H-huh? Phoenix: We need to know about the DL-6 Incident! Gumshoe: ...! Phoenix: That was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case. Gumshoe: ... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal. Maya: What!? Gumshoe: However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up. Present Metal Detector Phoenix: Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. This was really helpful. Gumshoe: R-really? Maya: You seem surprised! Gumshoe: Huh? N-no, not at all. Glad it worked out for you. Parrot Gumshoe: What's that? A parrot? Phoenix: The old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that \"incident\"... Gumshoe: That incident? Phoenix: DL-6. Gumshoe: Wh-what!? Maya: Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something? Parrot: *squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk* Maya: H-huh!? Phoenix: I'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word... Gumshoe: Yeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident? Phoenix: Wait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6? Maya: N-Nick! You think he might be!? Gumshoe: ... After clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot: Gumshoe: ... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need. Maya: All right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room! Phoenix: (I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...) December 26Police DepartmentRecords Room Maya: Wow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty. Phoenix: Ten years of files and ten years of dust, I guess. Maya: Let's find that DL-6 stuff quick! Phoenix: (Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?) Maya: Nick! I found out where the file is! Phoenix: O-oh, thanks! Maya: Just let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file! Examine Glass case Phoenix: It looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside. Maya: Nick... it's locked. Phoenix: They must keep important case files in there. Back wall Phoenix: There are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity... Maya: Nick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me! Cabinet Phoenix: This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk. Maya: Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for? Phoenix: Don't touch that! It's evidence... Shelves Phoenix: Here are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here. Maya: Wow... these are all case reports!? Phoenix: Yeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases. Maya: I guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust. Talk The case summary Phoenix: Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary. Maya: Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go. Phoenix: December 28... 2001. Maya: That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow! Phoenix: (So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release) Maya: What!? Is this the same district courthouse where we're holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?] in the original release) Phoenix: Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out. Maya: Wow... that was some earthquake! Phoenix: At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours! Maya: That would be scary like that, in the dark! Phoenix: There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious. Maya: The survivors...? Phoenix: One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart. Maya: That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it. Phoenix: (He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.) Victim data Phoenix: Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father? Maya: Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it! Phoenix: Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles. Maya: \"Miles\"...! Phoenix: Miles Edgeworth, of course. Maya: So he was on the elevator with his father! Phoenix: From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?) Suspect data Phoenix: Got any data on the suspect in there? Maya: Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it. Phoenix: The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently. Maya: So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it! Phoenix: But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond. Maya: Hammond... the victim in our case! Phoenix: Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared. Maya: Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder? Phoenix: (He may be closer than we think...) Present Anything Maya: Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here... After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth... Maya: Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out. Phoenix: Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need... DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how \"Dad\" will do testifying in court... To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\n-- The Night of the Murder --Butz: That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ... Judge: Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: There were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin... Judge: Ah... Phoenix: Um, well, okay. First of all, what time was it? Butz: Oh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak. Phoenix: And why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?Butz: I was looking for something and I, er, found it.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Looking for something\"...? Butz: Er, yeah. Judge: Mr. Butz, what was it you were looking for? Karma: Karma: What the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this \"Gourdy\"! Phoenix: (You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.) Karma: This is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with.Butz: So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Around what time was that? Butz: Uh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah. Judge: You're not sure? Butz: Hey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!? Phoenix: (People use watches these days, Larry...)Butz: Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did the sound come from? Butz: Yeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know. Judge: Did you look at the lake? Butz: Yeah, I looked.Butz: I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wasn't there a boat on the lake!? Judge: Order! Order! Well? Mr. Butz! Butz: Whoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not. Phoenix: (Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!) Karma: Hmph!Butz: So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you only heard one \"bang\" correct? Butz: Yeah. Phoenix: (Huh.)Present Lotta's Deposition Phoenix: Leads to: \"W-wait a sec, Larry!\"Maya: Well, Nick?Phoenix: Hmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.Maya: Sorry... I wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...Phoenix: W-wait a sec, Larry!Butz: Wh-what!?Phoenix: You only heard one \"bang\"!? You're sure!?Butz: That's what I said!Phoenix: But Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two \"bang\"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!Butz: Huh?Phoenix: Were you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?Butz: Yo, Nick, please!Phoenix: Huh?Butz: You know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?Phoenix: ...Judge: Mr. Butz.Butz: What!?Judge: You only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?Butz: ... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure.Judge: Eh...?Phoenix: Not sure!? H-how could you not be sure?Butz: Yeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...Phoenix: Something... else?Butz: My radio, dude! With my headphones. (Changed from [My radio, dude! On my headphones.] in the original release)Phoenix: Whaaaaaaat!?Judge: Order! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to the radio with your headphones? (Changed from [You were listening to a radio on earphones?] in the original release)Butz: Y-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?Judge: Hmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?Karma: Waste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?That's enough Phoenix: (No, I think I've heard enough. This is all too embarrassing... In fact, I think we've all heard enough.) Maya: What are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty! We have to turn this trial around now! Phoenix: Uh... Leads to: \"Your Honor.\"Continue Leads to: \"Your Honor.\"Phoenix: Your Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.Karma: Bah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!Judge: Very well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.Butz: Right! Leave it to me!Phoenix: (I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)Witness Testimony-- What Larry Heard --Butz: It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve! That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see? I was listening to it real booming loud, like. But I'm sure I heard that gunshot! I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.Judge: You were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?Butz: Yeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?Phoenix: (I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem here is.)Karma: Judge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!Judge: True enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.Phoenix:Phoenix: Wait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!Judge: Excuse me? \"Dee-jay\"...?Phoenix: An announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!Judge: V-very well, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: (I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What Larry Heard --Butz: It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you turned on the radio? Butz: Right! I just wanted to hear someone's voice, y'know? You don't know what it's like out there, alone, on Christmas Eve! Alone! Phoenix: (I shouldn't have said anything...)Butz: That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you by any chance remember the name of the program you were listening to? Karma: Karma: This has nothing to do with the case, Your Honor! Judge: Objection sustained. The witness was listening to the radio. That is all we need to know. Tell us, Mr. Butz, how loud was your radio set to that night?Butz: I was listening to it real booming loud, like.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Real \"booming\" loud? Butz: Yeah, y'know. Judge: And you had headphones on? Butz: Yup. Judge: I wouldn't think you could hear anything going on outside at all...Butz: But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can you prove that...? No... no, of course you can't. Butz: Nah, I can't prove it. But I remember that moment real clear. I mean, while I was talking about it, it came back real clear to me, y'know?Butz: I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What did she say? (Changed from [What did he say?] in the original release) Karma: Karma: Mr. Wright! Please cease these pointless questions! What possible good could knowing what a radio DJ said do us!? Judge: Indeed, Mr. von Karma has a point. I'll allow the question only if you see some reason why we should care...? We don't care Phoenix: (Hmm... right. I didn't really have a deep reason for asking that question, now that I think about it.) Understood, Your Honor. I withdraw my question. Judge: Continue your examination of the witness, then. Phoenix: (This is getting nowhere...) Leads back to cross-examination We should care Phoenix: We should care, Your Honor! Of course we should! Karma: Why? Phoenix: Uh. W-well, how do you know if we don't ask, hmm? Judge: Fine, very well. Mr. Butz, please testify to the court. What was the radio announcer saying when you heard the gunshot? Adds statement \"Just when she said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" I heard the gunshot!\"Butz: Just when she said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" I heard the gunshot!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure? Butz: Course I am! She had this real sexy voice... Phoenix: (Hmm... maybe von Karma was right. I'm not sure how that helped us at all.)Present Lake Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!? Butz: Huh? What's with the face? You look scary, dude. Hey, if you're trying to scare me, you better know I don't scare that easy! Judge: Is something the matter, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" when he heard the gunshot! Judge: Indeed... And...? Phoenix: \"Almost Christmas\" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!! Judge: That would seem to be the case, yes... Phoenix: But he should have heard that gunshot after midnight! This photograph is irrefutable proof of this fact! Judge: Let's see what the time was on the photo taken when the gun triggered Ms. Hart's camera. < 12/25 00:15 >...! Fifteen minutes after midnight, on Christmas Day! Leads to: \"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!\"Present Lotta's Deposition Phoenix: Phoenix: Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!? Butz: Huh? What's with the face? You look scary, dude. Hey, if you're trying to scare me, you better know I don't scare that easy! Judge: Is something the matter, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" when he heard the gunshot! Judge: Indeed... And...? Phoenix: \"Almost Christmas\" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!! Judge: That would seem to be the case, yes... Phoenix: But that contradicts the two testimonies we have heard, Your Honor! Both Ms. Hart and the old man said it was after midnight when they heard the shots! In other words... When they heard the gunshots, it was already Christmas!!! Leads to: \"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!\"Phoenix: (This is the most ludicrous testimony I've ever heard.

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The testimonies are from Larry Butz. The key points here are about the timing of the gunshot he heard.\n\nLarry's testimony says he heard a gunshot when the DJ said, \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" which would be on Christmas Eve, before midnight. But the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken at 00:15 AM on 12/25, which is after midnight. That means the gunshot happened on Christmas Day, not Christmas Eve. So Larry's claim that he heard it when the DJ mentioned \"almost Christmas\" (implying before midnight) contradicts the photo's timestamp showing it was after midnight. Therefore, the evidence is the Lake Photo (4) and the testimony is the fifth one where he mentions the DJ's statement."

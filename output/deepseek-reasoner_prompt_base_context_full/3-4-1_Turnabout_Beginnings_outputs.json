That was a whole year before Mia and I ever met.-- Six Years Earlier --Mia FeyFirst TrialFebruary 16, 9:24 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4Mia: (Ugh... I'm so nervous. I feel like I'm going to die. I never should've accepted this case...) Eeeeeeek! ...Ah! G-G-Good morning! (Don't be so jumpy, Mia!)???: I-I din't do nuttin'! I swear! I din't kill nobody!Mia: (Terry Fawles... ...My first client. Sentenced to death 5 years ago, and now... a prison escapee.)Fawles: ...Mia: (Just relax, Mia! Make small talk and try to relax him!) ...Err, umm... So why did you escape anyway?Fawles: Ah. Ah. UGGA!Mia: Eeeeek! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!Fawles: ...Ugh. I din't do nuttin'! I din't kill nobody! I never... I never lie! I din't escape from nowhere!Mia: Err... But, Mr. Fawles... The police just recaptured you two days ago.Fawles: ... Ugh. Sorry. I told a little lie.Mia: (Oh boy...)Fawles: But anyway, I din't do it! I never killed nobody!Mia: Umm, sorry for asking but... You're on death row, right?Fawles: Uh. Uh... UGGA!Mia: Eeeeeek! I'm really, really sorry!Fawles: They sentenced me to die 5 years ago! But I was tricked I tell you! That woman! She lied in her testimony! ...That's why I got the death penalty! I swear it! I din't kill her! I could never do that!Mia: (Two days ago, he escaped from the police wagon when it crashed... Then about 8 hours later... A policewoman was murdered before the police could recapture him. The police believe that Terry Fawles did it.) Umm... After you escaped, did you meet a policewoman?Fawles: ... Yeah... I did. ...She's the reason I escaped.Mia: (So that much is true... He did meet with the victim.)Fawles: But I din't kill her! She was alive when I left! She was alive...! It-It's true!Mia: (I can trust him... right? I mean, I should...)???: Ha...! You're not going to figure out the truth by just staring at the guy...Mia: Y-You're... Why are you here????: I came to see how our little kitten was doing all alone in the big, scary lion's den. ...I thought maybe you'd like someone to play with.Mia: Err, where is Mr. Grossberg????: Ha...! That old man is probably still in bed. I bet he's clutching an empty bottle and mumbling in his sleep.Armando: Aren't I good enough? After all, it's me... Diego Armando!Mia: I-I didn't say... So, Diego Armando, the finest attorney at Grossberg Law Offices, is here for me...?Armando: No, no, no... You've got it all wrong! Today, YOU'RE the finest! After all, it took an amazing amount of guts to take this case! Imagine... An escaped death row convict for a first client!Mia: Yeah, err... Th-Thanks. (I sure wish I could get out of it though!)Armando: Ha...! Relax. I just heard some good news. The prosecutor for today is fresh out of his diapers as well.Mia: R-Really!?Armando: However... Unlike a certain somebody who I won't mention... ...he's earned the reputation as a \"genius\" since beginning his law career.Mia: (G-Genius...?)Armando: Well, it's about time to head in, Kitten. Sharpen those claws of yours. It's go time!Mia: (A solitary confinement cell for the condemned must be the world's loneliest place. ...And that's what my client ran away from. Every other lawyer gave up on him... But not me. When I saw those overflowing eyes and heard that simple, child-like voice... I just had the feeling that he was telling the truth.)February 16, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Terry Fawles.Mia: The defense is ready, Your Honor.???: The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.Judge: I understand the lawyers for both sides are newcomers...?Mia: Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm Mia Fey.Edgeworth: Miles Edgeworth... Your Honor.Judge: So you're the new prosecutor everyone is talking about, eh? They say you joined the prosecutor's office at quite an early age.Edgeworth: At 20... Your Honor.Armando: I guess our little kitten hasn't earned herself much of a reputation yet, huh?Mia: (Come on, Mia! You can't lose! Not to someone younger than you!)Edgeworth: ...Hmph.Judge: Young people running a trial. I'm not too sure how I feel about that. ...Now then, the defendant in this case is currently a felon on death row. Two days ago, he escaped from a police wagon. Is that correct?Edgeworth: Precisely.Armando: But the defendant is not on trial for escaping prison. On the day that the defendant escaped, a policewoman was murdered...Mia: So we're here to determine if Mr. Fawles was responsible for her death...?Armando: You got it, Kitten.Judge: Well then, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's hear your opening statement.Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor. It was five years ago. The defendant, Terry Fawles, was sentenced to death in this very court. His crimes were kidnapping, extortion... and murder. The girl he threw off the bridge was only 14 years old.Judge: A truly horrible crime. I remember it well. There was no decisive evidence, so the trial was long and protracted.Edgeworth: Correct. But in the end, what finally decided the case was... ...a certain witness's testimony.Mia: A witness's testimony...Edgeworth: The testimony of Detective Valerie Hawthorne; the person who confronted this criminal. She arrested Mr. Fawles at the scene and later testified against him. She said she witnessed Mr. Fawles throw his young victim into the river. For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered...Mia: (So Ms. Hawthorne's testimony was the one that put him away...)Judge: That policewoman you just mentioned... That wouldn't be...?Edgeworth: Exactly. The victim. The same woman that was killed 2 days ago... Police Sergeant... Valerie Hawthorne.Judge: Aha...! I see... The man who was sentenced to death based on her testimony escaped two days ago... ...with only one thing on his mind. To take revenge against the woman who convicted him. ... Hmm... Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!Mia: Huh?Judge: Yes, yes... It's quite obvious that the defendant is guilty.Mia:Mia: W-Wait a minute! That's not right! At least hear the case before you decide on the outcome, Your Honor!Judge: Grrrngh... Watch yourself, Ms. Fey! I'm not sure I care for your word choice, or your tone of voice.Edgeworth: Young people these days simply don't know how to respect their elders.Mia: (Why you...! You're even younger than me, you hypocrite!)Judge: Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, please call your first witness.Edgeworth: I call the detective who was in charge of the initial investigation of this case.Edgeworth: Witness... State your name and occupation.Gumshoe: Gumshoe. Dick Gumshoe. I'm the homicide detective in charge of the case, sir! I finally got promoted to the detective division half a year ago!Mia: I don't believe anyone asked you about that.Gumshoe: Hey, ma'am! You got any idea how much work it takes... ......Mia: Wh-What is it?Gumshoe: You... Y-You're really gorgeous...Mia: Excuse me?Gumshoe: No, seriously... My heart... It's aching for you...Edgeworth: Detective. Pull yourself together and try to be professional. Otherwise... I'll write you up on contempt so quick that something other than your heart will ache!Gumshoe: Urk... O-OK, I-I got it!Judge: ...Now, Detective. Tell us about the incident.Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Right away! The victim was Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, a veteran on the police force. She was stabbed in the back with a knife and died from excessive blood loss.Judge: That much is already stated in the autopsy report. The court would like to hear more details about the incident itself.Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I gotcha! OK! Let's take a look at this aerial map of the area here! This is a sketch of Dusky Bridge, an old suspension bridge. And the river that runs under there is Eagle River. The victim and the defendant met there... On top of the bridge. After stabbing her in the back, the killer carried the victim back to his car. He was recaptured at a police checkpoint as he was trying to make his getaway, sir.Judge: Hmm... I see...Dusky Bridge Map added to the Court Record.Judge: Was the victim's blood found on the bridge?Gumshoe: The victim, Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, was wearing a thick coat, sir. Unfortunately, no traces of blood were found on the bridge.Judge: Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth. I warn you that I absolutely despise conjecture. If there was no blood on the bridge, then you have no proof that they even met there!Edgeworth: Your Honor. If you would listen to the testimony we have prepared, I'm sure you'll be convinced. The two of them most certainly did meet on the bridge that day...Judge: Why, Mr. Edgeworth... I'm not sure I like you wagging your finger at me as though I were some hoser! Detective, proceed with your testimony!Gumshoe: Um... Yes, sir!Mia: (Here we go, Mia! Hang on...!)Armando: OK now... Listen carefully, Kitten. One little mistake and this guy will drink you for morning tea! Trust me and get ready.Witness Testimony-- Summary of the Incident --Gumshoe: On the day of the incident, an unknown person phoned the sergeant and asked to meet. Sergeant Hawthorne went to Dusky Bridge at the designated time and met with Mr. Fawles. And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir. The criminal stuffed her body into his car trunk and tried to make a getaway. Mr. Fawles was arrested at a police checkpoint we set up at the base of the mountain.Judge: Hmm... Well, you certainly have established the importance of the bridge.Edgeworth: ...Naturally.Judge: Now, would the defense please hurry up and proceed with the cross-examination.Mia: Y-Yes, Your Honor! C-C-Cross-examination... Coming right up!Armando: Hey, hey! Settle down there, Kitten! If you keep trembling like that, you're gonna make me spill my coffee!Mia: I-I-I'm not t-trembling! It-It-It's just cold in here!Armando: The courtroom can be a cold battlefield alright. Especially... for a beginner.Mia: I-I don't need you to worry about me...! I mean... I mean, the defendant, the witness... everyone's a beginner in here!Armando: Ha...! You got me there. But maybe you should keep your claws out, and show them what you've got... Kitten.Mia: (It's OK, Mia. Stay calm... Just remember those court procedure videos you stayed up all last night watching!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Summary of the Incident --Gumshoe: On the day of the incident, an unknown person phoned the sergeant and asked to meet.Press Mia: Mia: This \"unknown person\"... You have no idea who it might be, right? Gumshoe: Sorry, but I'm afraid I do! Mia: What...? Gumshoe: The one who called Sergeant Hawthorne was the defendant, Terry Fawles! Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaat! The defendant...! The defendant called her!? Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne was a very thorough person, sir! She left a note about her phone call with Mr. Fawles. Mia: A note...? Gumshoe: Yeah, a top-secret memo that she left on her desk. Victim's Note added to the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... According to this note, it seems the one who called her to the bridge was indeed... ...the defendant, Terry Fawles! Mia: Nngh! (Whose bright idea was it to keep that note from me!?) Armando: Ha...! Looks like the judge is even more sure of his verdict now. Listen up! Never ask a question if you don't already know the answer! Mia: (It's that detective's fault! He's the one that said, \"unknown person\"...!) Gumshoe: Hey now! Don't make that face at me! I just said it that way 'cause the prosecutor told me to! Mia: (Was that... a trap...? ...With that cute face, I didn't expect him to be so sneaky.) Edgeworth: Hmph.Press (subsequent times) Mia: Mia: This \"unknown person\"... You have no idea who it might be, right? Gumshoe: Sorry, but I'm afraid I do! Mia: What...? Gumshoe: The one who called Sergeant Hawthorne was the defendant, Terry Fawles! Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaat! The defendant...! The defendant called her!? Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne was a very thorough person, sir! She left a note about her phone call with Mr. Fawles. Judge: Hmm... According to this note, it seems the one who called her to the bridge was indeed... ...the defendant, Terry Fawles! Mia: Nngh! (Whose bright idea was it to keep that note from me!?) Armando: Ha...!

Mia: (Was that... a trap...? ...With that cute face, I didn't expect him to be so sneaky.) Edgeworth: Hmph.Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne went to Dusky Bridge at the designated time and met with Mr. Fawles.Press Mia: Mia: A bridge up in the mountains? But why meet there? Gumshoe: Because it is a very important place to the defendant, that's why. Judge: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: If you remember, 5 years ago, the defendant kidnapped a young girl. He was chased onto a bridge... And it was there that he killed his hostage. And the place where all of this occurred is, of course, Dusky Bridge. Mia: ...! Gumshoe: The very place where Sergeant Hawthorne arrested and handcuffed Mr. Fawles. Armando: Ha...! Returning to the scene of the crime... How nostalgic.Gumshoe: And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir.Press Mia: Mia: Was the body of the victim discovered right away? Gumshoe: Yeah. We were really on the ball. We found the criminal within one hour of the murder. It was great! We even got to say, \"Don't move! We've got you surrounded!\" Mia: (...Wait a second. Isn't there something weird about that...?) Armando: The location was a suspension bridge, up in the mountains. So how did they find out about the crime so quickly...? Mia: Sergeant Hawthorne must have mentioned the phone call to someone else, right? Armando: Ha...! If that's what had happened, then she wouldn't have been killed. Gumshoe: She never mentioned the phone call from Mr. Fawles. But... She left a note on her desk about it. If only I had noticed it earlier... Maybe she'd still be alive. Mia: (I wonder why she didn't mention the phone call to anyone...?)Gumshoe: The criminal stuffed her body into his car trunk and tried to make a getaway.Press Mia: Mia: Mr. Fawles had a car, then? Gumshoe: Well, that bridge is way up in the mountains, ma'am. The defendant and the victim both went up there by car. I mean, how else, right? Judge: What! You mean the defendant drove his own car? Gumshoe: No, no, of course not. ...It was stolen. He stole it from a young couple that had been waiting at a red light. Judge: Hmm... Car thieves... I'm not sure how I feel about car thieves. Mia: (Is this guy sure about how he feels about ANYTHING?) Gumshoe: This is a photo of the stolen car's trunk. ...Naturally, that's the body of Valerie Hawthorne in there. Judge: Whoa! That... That doesn't look too comfortable... Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Mia: The victim... She was stabbed in the back, correct? Gumshoe: Yeah. Armando: Ha...! ...For some reason, men always seem to get stabbed in the back... Mia: (We're talking about a woman here...) Gumshoe: You can't tell from this photo, but... ...the knife was stuck in her back nice and firm. Judge: The condition of the body when it was discovered is very important information. Detective, was there anything strange or noteworthy in the trunk of the car? Adds statement \"Here's a photo of the trunk. But I don't see anything strange, do you? Anyway...\"Press (subsequent times) Mia: Mia: Mr. Fawles had a car, then? Gumshoe: Well, that bridge is way up in the mountains, ma'am. The defendant and the victim both went up there by car.

I din't do nuttin'!! Gumshoe: ...That's all he says. Judge: \"Nuttin'\"? I wouldn't say he did \"nuttin'\". At the very least, we know he stole a car! Gumshoe: It's just what he always says, Your Honor. And then he always says... Fawles: ... Uh. Sorry. I told a little lie. Gumshoe: ...Or something like that. Mia: ... Judge: Well, in any case, it seems he was caught and arrested. Edgeworth: Precisely.Present Victim's Note Mia: Leads to: \"...Witness!\"Gumshoe: Mr. Fawles was arrested at a police checkpoint we set up at the base of the mountain.Press Mia: Mia: That certainly is some impressive police work. Gumshoe: Well, no, actually it was way too close for comfort. We set up that checkpoint just after 5:00 PM... We figured that Mr. Fawles might just try to run. Mia: ...What do you mean it was too close for comfort? Edgeworth: The two of them arranged to meet at 4:30 PM. And it takes approximately 30 minutes to go from the bridge to the checkpoint. Mia: (Hmm... That WAS kinda close. Any later and Mr. Fawles could have slipped right by.)Armando: Listen up, Kitten. There's a big trap waiting for you in that testimony.Mia: A t-trap?Armando: Walk into it carelessly, and it'll leave more than just a flesh wound. Fun, huh?Mia: No, it's NOT!Armando: Well, if you want to have any chance at all, you'd better get some more information. And if you're going to get caught in a trap, it's best to get caught early. You can always look for contradictions afterwards.Mia: (The ever-famous \"contradictions\".

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided the story, characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let me start by going through each testimony and cross-referencing with the evidence.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies by Gumshoe. The relevant ones are about the incident. Testimony 3 says the criminal stuffed her body into the car trunk. Evidence 4 is the Crime Photo of the trunk. The photo shows the victim's coat is dry and clean. But the bridge is over a river, and the area around might have mud or water. Also, the Scarf (Evidence 5) is wet and muddy, which was found on the bridge. So if the victim was killed on the bridge and then put into the trunk, why is the coat dry? The Scarf being wet suggests she was there, maybe fell or was near water. But the coat in the trunk photo is dry. That's a contradiction because if she was murdered on the bridge, her coat should have signs of the environment, like being wet or muddy, especially if the scarf was. But the coat in the trunk is dry, so maybe she wasn't killed there. That would contradict Testimony 2, which states she was murdered at the bridge. Wait, Testimony 2: \"And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir.\" So if she was murdered on the bridge, her coat would be wet or dirty, but the Crime Photo shows it's dry. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (murder on bridge) and Evidence 4 (dry coat in trunk). But wait, Testimony 3 is about moving the body to the trunk. The coat's dryness would mean she wasn't at the bridge when killed, because the scarf was left there wet. So the murder didn't happen on the bridge, thus contradicting Testimony 2. So the correct pair would be Evidence 4 (Crime Photo showing dry coat) and Testimony 2 (murdered on bridge). But let me check the evidence again. Evidence 4: coat is dry and clean. Scarf (Evidence 5) is wet and muddy. So if the scarf was worn by the victim at the time, but the coat is dry, that's inconsistent. Therefore, the murder might have occurred elsewhere, which would contradict the testimony that she was killed on the bridge. So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (murder at bridge) and Evidence 4 (dry coat in trunk, implying she wasn't there when killed). But let me check the exact wording of the testimonies. Testimony 2 says \"And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir.\" \"That's\" refers to Dusky Bridge. So if she was murdered there, her clothes should reflect the environment. The scarf was found on the bridge (wet and muddy), but the coat in the trunk is dry. Therefore, the presence of the wet scarf on the bridge but the dry coat in the trunk suggests that the murder didn't happen there, contradicting Testimony 2. Hence, the evidence is 4 (Crime Photo) and testimony 2. Wait, but another possibility: the Scarf is Evidence 5, which is separate from the coat. The victim was wearing a coat and scarf. The Scarf was found on the bridge, but the coat in the trunk is dry. So maybe the scarf was lost during a struggle, but the coat remained dry. Hmm. But if she was stabbed on the bridge, there should be blood on the bridge. However, the autopsy report says she was stabbed in the back. The coat is thick, so maybe the blood didn't seep through, but the fact that the coat is dry and clean in the trunk photo could imply that she wasn't exposed to the elements on the bridge when she was killed. Alternatively, the bridge's environment might have mud or water, which would affect her clothes. The scarf being wet and muddy suggests she was on the bridge, but the coat is dry. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the testimony that she was murdered on the bridge (Testimony 2) is contradicted by the Crime Photo (Evidence 4) showing her coat is dry. Thus, the answer should be evidence 4 and testimony 2."

Sharpen those claws of yours. It's go time!Mia: (A solitary confinement cell for the condemned must be the world's loneliest place. ...And that's what my client ran away from. Every other lawyer gave up on him... But not me. When I saw those overflowing eyes and heard that simple, child-like voice... I just had the feeling that he was telling the truth.)February 16, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Terry Fawles.Mia: The defense is ready, Your Honor.???: The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.Judge: I understand the lawyers for both sides are newcomers...?Mia: Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm Mia Fey.Edgeworth: Miles Edgeworth... Your Honor.Judge: So you're the new prosecutor everyone is talking about, eh? They say you joined the prosecutor's office at quite an early age.Edgeworth: At 20... Your Honor.Armando: I guess our little kitten hasn't earned herself much of a reputation yet, huh?Mia: (Come on, Mia! You can't lose! Not to someone younger than you!)Edgeworth: ...Hmph.Judge: Young people running a trial. I'm not too sure how I feel about that. ...Now then, the defendant in this case is currently a felon on death row. Two days ago, he escaped from a police wagon. Is that correct?Edgeworth: Precisely.Armando: But the defendant is not on trial for escaping prison. On the day that the defendant escaped, a policewoman was murdered...Mia: So we're here to determine if Mr. Fawles was responsible for her death...?Armando: You got it, Kitten.Judge: Well then, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's hear your opening statement.Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor. It was five years ago. The defendant, Terry Fawles, was sentenced to death in this very court. His crimes were kidnapping, extortion... and murder. The girl he threw off the bridge was only 14 years old.Judge: A truly horrible crime. I remember it well. There was no decisive evidence, so the trial was long and protracted.Edgeworth: Correct. But in the end, what finally decided the case was... ...a certain witness's testimony.Mia: A witness's testimony...Edgeworth: The testimony of Detective Valerie Hawthorne; the person who confronted this criminal. She arrested Mr. Fawles at the scene and later testified against him. She said she witnessed Mr. Fawles throw his young victim into the river. For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered...Mia: (So Ms. Hawthorne's testimony was the one that put him away...)Judge: That policewoman you just mentioned... That wouldn't be...?Edgeworth: Exactly. The victim. The same woman that was killed 2 days ago... Police Sergeant... Valerie Hawthorne.Judge: Aha...! I see... The man who was sentenced to death based on her testimony escaped two days ago... ...with only one thing on his mind. To take revenge against the woman who convicted him. ... Hmm... Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!Mia: Huh?Judge: Yes, yes... It's quite obvious that the defendant is guilty.Mia:Mia: W-Wait a minute! That's not right! At least hear the case before you decide on the outcome, Your Honor!Judge: Grrrngh... Watch yourself, Ms. Fey! I'm not sure I care for your word choice, or your tone of voice.Edgeworth: Young people these days simply don't know how to respect their elders.Mia: (Why you...! You're even younger than me, you hypocrite!)Judge: Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, please call your first witness.Edgeworth: I call the detective who was in charge of the initial investigation of this case.Edgeworth: Witness... State your name and occupation.Gumshoe: Gumshoe. Dick Gumshoe. I'm the homicide detective in charge of the case, sir! I finally got promoted to the detective division half a year ago!Mia: I don't believe anyone asked you about that.Gumshoe: Hey, ma'am! You got any idea how much work it takes... ......Mia: Wh-What is it?Gumshoe: You... Y-You're really gorgeous...Mia: Excuse me?Gumshoe: No, seriously... My heart... It's aching for you...Edgeworth: Detective. Pull yourself together and try to be professional. Otherwise... I'll write you up on contempt so quick that something other than your heart will ache!Gumshoe: Urk... O-OK, I-I got it!Judge: ...Now, Detective. Tell us about the incident.Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Right away! The victim was Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, a veteran on the police force. She was stabbed in the back with a knife and died from excessive blood loss.Judge: That much is already stated in the autopsy report. The court would like to hear more details about the incident itself.Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I gotcha! OK! Let's take a look at this aerial map of the area here! This is a sketch of Dusky Bridge, an old suspension bridge. And the river that runs under there is Eagle River. The victim and the defendant met there... On top of the bridge. After stabbing her in the back, the killer carried the victim back to his car. He was recaptured at a police checkpoint as he was trying to make his getaway, sir.Judge: Hmm... I see...Dusky Bridge Map added to the Court Record.Judge: Was the victim's blood found on the bridge?Gumshoe: The victim, Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, was wearing a thick coat, sir. Unfortunately, no traces of blood were found on the bridge.Judge: Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth. I warn you that I absolutely despise conjecture. If there was no blood on the bridge, then you have no proof that they even met there!Edgeworth: Your Honor. If you would listen to the testimony we have prepared, I'm sure you'll be convinced. The two of them most certainly did meet on the bridge that day...Judge: Why, Mr. Edgeworth... I'm not sure I like you wagging your finger at me as though I were some hoser! Detective, proceed with your testimony!Gumshoe: Um... Yes, sir!Mia: (Here we go, Mia! Hang on...!)Armando: OK now... Listen carefully, Kitten. One little mistake and this guy will drink you for morning tea! Trust me and get ready.Witness Testimony-- Summary of the Incident --Gumshoe: On the day of the incident, an unknown person phoned the sergeant and asked to meet. Sergeant Hawthorne went to Dusky Bridge at the designated time and met with Mr. Fawles. And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir. The criminal stuffed her body into his car trunk and tried to make a getaway. Mr. Fawles was arrested at a police checkpoint we set up at the base of the mountain.Judge: Hmm... Well, you certainly have established the importance of the bridge.Edgeworth: ...Naturally.Judge: Now, would the defense please hurry up and proceed with the cross-examination.Mia: Y-Yes, Your Honor! C-C-Cross-examination... Coming right up!Armando: Hey, hey! Settle down there, Kitten! If you keep trembling like that, you're gonna make me spill my coffee!Mia: I-I-I'm not t-trembling! It-It-It's just cold in here!Armando: The courtroom can be a cold battlefield alright. Especially... for a beginner.Mia: I-I don't need you to worry about me...! I mean... I mean, the defendant, the witness... everyone's a beginner in here!Armando: Ha...! You got me there. But maybe you should keep your claws out, and show them what you've got... Kitten.Mia: (It's OK, Mia. Stay calm... Just remember those court procedure videos you stayed up all last night watching!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Summary of the Incident --Gumshoe: On the day of the incident, an unknown person phoned the sergeant and asked to meet.Press Mia: Mia: This \"unknown person\"...

The defendant...! The defendant called her!? Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne was a very thorough person, sir! She left a note about her phone call with Mr. Fawles. Mia: A note...? Gumshoe: Yeah, a top-secret memo that she left on her desk. Victim's Note added to the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... According to this note, it seems the one who called her to the bridge was indeed... ...the defendant, Terry Fawles! Mia: Nngh! (Whose bright idea was it to keep that note from me!?) Armando: Ha...! Looks like the judge is even more sure of his verdict now. Listen up! Never ask a question if you don't already know the answer! Mia: (It's that detective's fault!

Edgeworth: Hmph.Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne went to Dusky Bridge at the designated time and met with Mr. Fawles.Press Mia: Mia: A bridge up in the mountains? But why meet there? Gumshoe: Because it is a very important place to the defendant, that's why. Judge: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: If you remember, 5 years ago, the defendant kidnapped a young girl. He was chased onto a bridge... And it was there that he killed his hostage. And the place where all of this occurred is, of course, Dusky Bridge. Mia: ...! Gumshoe: The very place where Sergeant Hawthorne arrested and handcuffed Mr. Fawles. Armando: Ha...! Returning to the scene of the crime... How nostalgic.Gumshoe: And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir.Press Mia: Mia: Was the body of the victim discovered right away? Gumshoe: Yeah. We were really on the ball. We found the criminal within one hour of the murder. It was great! We even got to say, \"Don't move! We've got you surrounded!\" Mia: (...Wait a second. Isn't there something weird about that...?) Armando: The location was a suspension bridge, up in the mountains. So how did they find out about the crime so quickly...? Mia: Sergeant Hawthorne must have mentioned the phone call to someone else, right? Armando: Ha...! If that's what had happened, then she wouldn't have been killed. Gumshoe: She never mentioned the phone call from Mr. Fawles. But... She left a note on her desk about it. If only I had noticed it earlier... Maybe she'd still be alive. Mia: (I wonder why she didn't mention the phone call to anyone...?)Gumshoe: The criminal stuffed her body into his car trunk and tried to make a getaway.Press Mia: Mia: Mr. Fawles had a car, then? Gumshoe: Well, that bridge is way up in the mountains, ma'am. The defendant and the victim both went up there by car. I mean, how else, right? Judge: What! You mean the defendant drove his own car? Gumshoe: No, no, of course not. ...It was stolen. He stole it from a young couple that had been waiting at a red light. Judge: Hmm... Car thieves... I'm not sure how I feel about car thieves.

I can't seem to find it in this photo...Gumshoe: Um... Well, to be honest, we didn't find it in the trunk, ma'am...Mia: And you stopped there!? You should have looked for it!Gumshoe: Aaaaaaarrrggg...!Judge: The caller told her to wear it to identify herself, so I'd expect she did just that! Well, Mr. Edgeworth!?

I was there first, and decided to conduct my own investigation.Gumshoe: Wh-Why...? Why didn't you tell me?Edgeworth: I made a decision to keep all pieces of evidence in my personal satchel. It's the safest place I know.Armando: Hmph! That hot-shot sure has a flair for the dramatic...Edgeworth: It's not exactly \"white\", as the caller requested... But as you can see, it's close enough, for what it was intended for.Judge: Hmmm... It looks like it spent some time in the mud.Edgeworth: Not surprising... It was drizzling on the mountain that day.Mia: (Prosecutor Edgeworth... He was intentionally hiding that scarf the whole time!)Judge: The court will accept the scarf into evidence.Scarf added to the Court Record.Edgeworth: Now, if the attorney for the defense is finished embarrassing herself... ...I'd like to move on with the testimony. That IS alright with you, isn't it, Ms. Fey?Mia: (Boy would I like to wrap this scarf around his smarmy little neck...)Edgeworth: Very good. Now, if we're done with this mud-covered scarf business... ...the prosecution moves to establish conclusively, and with hard evidence that... ...Ms. Hawthorne and Mr. Fawles did indeed meet on that bridge that day. Further, we will show exactly what occurred there.Judge: That sounds quite promising. I can't wait to hear all about it.Mia: (Argh... Everything is moving at his whim...)Armando: Don't forget, Kitten. There's a reason why everyone considers this kid a genius.Mia: (A genius, huh...)Witness Testimony-- Events on Dusky Bridge --Gumshoe: Actually, there's an eyewitness who was there when the incident took place. This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows the vic wearing the scarf, sir. (Changed from [This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows her wearing the scarf, sir.] in the original release) It was drizzling that day; unfortunately, it's a little hard to see what's going on. Anyway, the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back! ...That must have been when the scarf fell off.Judge: Hmm. Looking at this photo... ...you really get the sense that this bridge is very high up.Edgeworth: It is about a 40 feet drop from the bridge to the Eagle River down below.Judge: Mr. Edgeworth, who took this photo anyway?Edgeworth: Let's just say that it was a well-intentioned third party.Judge: Aha! A potential witness! So why isn't this person in the courtroom?Gumshoe: Well... They said they absolutely did not want to testify.Edgeworth: ...The person in question is very delicate, Your Honor. Besides, as long as we have this photo, we see no reason to compel her to testify.Judge: ... I'm not sure how I feel about that!Witness's Photo added to the Court Record.Edgeworth: So, as you can see, Terry Fawles had both the motive and the opportunity. I think it's quite clear at this point what happened on that bridge.Judge: ... Hmm. Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!Mia: Huh?Judge: Yes, it's quite obvious. He's clearly guilty.Mia: N-Not again! That's not fair! I haven't even done my cross-examination yet!Judge: Hmm...Mia: (What do you mean, \"Hmm\"!?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Events on Dusky Bridge --Gumshoe: Actually, there's an eyewitness who was there when the incident took place.Press Mia: Mia: Who is this eyewitness? Gumshoe: She's a college student! Mia: A female college student...? Gumshoe: That's right! Meaning she's \"female\" AND a \"college student\", ma'am! She doesn't do well in front of other people, so I came to testify for her. Mia: Maybe so! But as the attorney for the defense, I have the right to cross-examine her... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the time being, we're not relying on the witness's statements... That is all. Mia: Wh-What is that supposed to mean!? Edgeworth: ...The prosecution has other, more decisive evidence. Our case doesn't rest on the vague testimony of a female college student. Judge: A female college student, eh. Gumshoe: It means she's \"female\" AND a \"college student\", sir! Edgeworth: If you absolutely must hear her testimony, you'll have to give us a good reason why. Mia: Grrr... Judge: Please tell us about the more decisive evidence in question.Gumshoe: This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows the vic wearing the scarf, sir. (Changed from [This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows her wearing the scarf, sir.] in the original release)Press Mia: Mia: (The victim is wearing a scarf in that photo alright.) So, about the witness who took this photo... What was this person doing all the way in the mountains? Gumshoe: She was taking photos of wild flowers apparently. Edgeworth: There are many unusual types of flora on that mountain, Ms. Fey. People in the area say it's because of the spirits that live there. Judge: S-S-Spirits! Now that you mention it, th-this photo... This cloudy fog-like thing... Is-Is it a ghost!? I-I don't believe it! Gumshoe: No, Your Honor, no... I don't think it's a ghost.Gumshoe: It was drizzling that day; unfortunately, it's a little hard to see what's going on.Press Mia: Mia: Drizzling, huh? Gumshoe: That's right. There was a light rain coming down. The whole place was dreary... ...But not as dreary as the mood that's in this court room right now. Ha ha. Mia: ... Edgeworth: ... Judge: ... Gumshoe: ...Looks like a cold front just moved in. Edgeworth: In any case... The point is that the area was quite damp. There was even some fog. Gumshoe: I even slipped and fell while I was on the bridge. It was really something.Gumshoe: Anyway, the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back!Press Mia: Mia: Is that part of the witness's testimony as well? Gumshoe: Of course it is. He pushed the victim hard in the back and she fell down right on her stomach! Judge: Hmm... ...I remember that happening once myself. It was really broodle. Mia: ... (Are you talking about seeing someone get pushed, or were you the one getting pushed? Or does it mean that you pushed someone down like that once...? With his mind-boggling tales and the way he said, \"brutal\", I wonder if he's Canadian...) Armando: Ha...! Save your nasty look for the right person. Mia: Huh...? Armando: ...Take a look. Poor baby... The Court Record seems to have wet itself. Mia: Hey! Watch where you spill your coffee! (The Court Record, huh...)Present Crime Photo Mia: Leads to: \"So at the time of the crime, there was a light drizzle coming down, correct?\"Gumshoe: ...That must have been when the scarf fell off.Press Mia: Mia: So in other words, there was a struggle between the criminal and the victim, huh? Gumshoe: That's what the witness said. Well. It looks like she didn't remember about the scarf. But from what she said, it sounded like a pretty violent fight, ma'am. Mia: (The area was wet from rain. The bridge was probably wet, too. Which would explain why the scarf was all covered in mud, but... There's something about this testimony that's still bothering me...)Present Crime Photo Mia: Leads to: \"So at the time of the crime, there was a light drizzle coming down, correct?\"Armando: Heh, talk about a surprise. I had no idea there was a photo.Mia: S-So what do I do...\u00a0?Armando: You really still believe him? Mr. Crybaby, I mean?Mia: Of course I do!Armando: Hmph...! So the little kitten believes in fairy tales, huh... In that case, the answer is obvious. If what you believe is the truth... ...then that means that somewhere, hidden in that testimony, is a contradiction. One huge contradiction waiting to be discovered. ...That's your chance.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Terry Fawles\nDescription: My client. Sentenced to death 5 years ago.

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies here. The user provided a bunch of information from the game transcript, including characters, evidence, and testimonies. The task is to find a pair where an evidence item directly contradicts a specific testimony.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Testimony 3 is Gumshoe saying the criminal shoved the victim from behind and stabbed her in the back. The key points here are the manner of the attack\u2014shoving from behind and stabbing in the back. \n\nNow, looking at the evidence, let's check the Crime Photo (Evidence 4). The description says the victim's coat is dry and clean. But according to Testimony 2, it was drizzling that day, and the bridge was wet. If she was pushed down onto a wet bridge, her coat should be wet or muddy. However, the coat in the photo is dry and clean. That seems contradictory. Wait, but the testimony about the drizzle is Testimony 2, not 3. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Scarf (Evidence 5) being found on the bridge contradicts something. The Scarf is blue, wet, and muddy, but the Victim's Note (Evidence 3) says to wear a white scarf. But the Scarf is blue, so that's a contradiction. But which testimony does that contradict? Testimony 1 says the photo shows the vic wearing the scarf. The Witness's Photo (Evidence 6) shows her wearing a scarf. But the scarf in the photo is supposed to be white according to the note, but the found scarf is blue. However, Edgeworth presents the Scarf as being found on the bridge, explaining that it's not exactly white but close enough. So maybe that's not the contradiction.\n\nWait, another angle: the Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the victim's coat as dry and clean. But according to the testimony that it was drizzling and the bridge was wet, if she was pushed down and stabbed, her coat should be wet or dirty. However, the coat in the trunk is dry. But the testimony about the stabbing (Testimony 3) doesn't directly mention the coat's condition. However, if the attack happened in the rain, the coat would get wet. But the coat in the trunk is dry. So maybe the contradiction is between the Crime Photo (dry coat) and Testimony 2 (drizzling). But the user asked for which testimony contradicts the evidence. Alternatively, Testimony 3 says she was pushed down, which would imply the coat gets dirty or wet, but the Crime Photo shows it's clean and dry. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Evidence 4. But wait, the Crime Photo's caption says the coat is dry and clean. So if she was pushed onto a wet bridge, her coat should be wet or muddy. But the Crime Photo shows it's dry. Therefore, the dry coat in the Crime Photo contradicts the testimony that she was pushed down in the drizzle, leading to her being wet/muddy. So the evidence would be 4 (Crime Photo) and testimony 3 (shoved and stabbed). But wait, the exact testimony is about the action, not the coat's condition. Alternatively, maybe the Scarf's condition (wet and muddy, Evidence 5) contradicts Testimony 4 (scarf fell off during the struggle). But the Scarf being muddy would make sense if it fell off during the struggle in the rain. Hmm.\n\nWait, another point: the Witness's Photo (Evidence 6) shows the victim wearing a scarf and a hat. The scarf in the photo is presumably the white one mentioned in the note, but the found scarf is blue. Edgeworth presented the blue one, but the note says white. That's a contradiction between Victim's Note (Evidence 3) and the Scarf (Evidence 5). But how does that relate to the testimonies? Testimony 1 says the photo shows her wearing the scarf. The problem is the color. The note says to wear a white scarf, but the scarf in the photo (if the photo's scarf is white) and the found scarf is blue. But Edgeworth explains that the scarf isn't exactly white. Maybe that's not a direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the autopsy report (Evidence 1) says she died between 4-5 PM. The meeting was at 4:30 PM. The time of death aligns, but maybe the timeline. If the meeting was at 4:30, and the murder happened then, the car was found at the checkpoint around 5 PM. But the coat being dry might be an issue. If it was drizzling, and the coat is dry, perhaps she was killed elsewhere. But the testimony says she was killed on the bridge. So the dry coat in the trunk (Crime Photo) contradicts the drizzling weather (Testimony 2). Therefore, Evidence 4 (Crime Photo showing dry coat) contradicts Testimony 2 (drizzling). But the user needs the testimony number. Testimony 3 is about the stabbing, Testimony 2 is about the drizzle.\n\nWait, but the question is which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user example uses evidence 2 and testimony 3, but that's just an example. Let me recheck.\n\nThe Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the victim's coat is dry. The testimony about the drizzle (Testimony 2) says it was raining. If she was outside in the rain, her coat would be wet, but the photo shows it's dry. So that's a contradiction between Evidence 4 and Testimony 2. But Testimony 2 is \"It was drizzling that day; unfortunately, it's a little hard to see what's going on.\" So the fact that the coat is dry contradicts the fact that it was drizzling. However, maybe the coat was waterproof? But the evidence doesn't state that. Alternatively, if she was killed on the bridge in the rain, her coat should be wet, but in the trunk photo, it's dry. Therefore, Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 2.\n\nBut the user might be looking for another contradiction. Let's think again. The witness's photo (Evidence 6) shows the victim standing near the broken end of the bridge. The bridge is broken towards the east. The caption says the view from the south to the parking lot is obstructed by rocks. If the witness took the photo from the south, but the rocks block the view, how did the witness take the photo? But this might not directly contradict a testimony.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back. The autopsy report (Evidence 1) says she was stabbed in the back. That's consistent. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the coat is clean and dry. If she was pushed onto a wet bridge, the coat should be wet or muddy, but it's dry. So the contradiction is between the Crime Photo (dry coat) and the fact that it was raining (Testimony 2). Therefore, Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 2. But the user's answer example pairs evidence 2 (Dusky Bridge Map) with testimony 3. Wait, why would that be?\n\nWait, the Dusky Bridge Map (Evidence 2) mentions that the bridge is broken midway towards the east. The Witness's Photo (Evidence 6) shows the victim standing close to the broken end. If the bridge is broken, how did the victim and the defendant get there? Wait, the map says the bridge connects to the parking lot towards the west. The broken part is east. So if the victim is near the broken end (east), that's dangerous. But the testimony says the criminal shoved her down from behind and stabbed her. If the bridge is broken, maybe the photo's positioning is impossible. For instance, if the bridge is broken, they can't be on the east side. But according to the map, the bridge's broken end is towards the east. The parking lot is west. So if the photo shows them near the broken end (east), but the bridge is broken, they couldn't be there. So the Witness's Photo (Evidence 6) contradicts the Dusky Bridge Map (Evidence 2). But that's between two evidences, not a testimony and evidence. Alternatively, Testimony 3 says the criminal shoved her down from behind. If they were on the broken part of the bridge, maybe she would have fallen into the river. But the autopsy says she died from blood loss from a stab wound, not a fall. Hmm.\n\nWait, another angle: the scarf in the photo (Witness's Photo, Evidence 6) shows the victim wearing a scarf. The found scarf (Evidence 5) is blue, muddy, and wet. The Victim's Note (Evidence 3) says to wear a white scarf. So the scarf in the photo is white, but the found one is blue. That's a contradiction. But Edgeworth says it's \"close enough,\" but maybe the color discrepancy is a contradiction. However, the user's answer needs to pair evidence and testimony. Testimony 1 states the photo shows the vic wearing the scarf. The scarf in the photo is white, but the found one is blue. But since the note says white, maybe the scarf in the photo is white, but the one found is blue, indicating someone else's scarf. So this would contradict the testimony that the scarf in the photo is the same as the one found. But according to the game, Edgeworth presents the blue scarf as the one from the bridge, so maybe the contradiction is between the Victim's Note (white) and the Scarf (blue). But how does that relate to the testimonies?\n\nAlternatively, the testimony says the scarf fell off during the struggle (Testimony 4). The Scarf (Evidence 5) is found on the bridge. The Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the victim in the trunk without the scarf. That's consistent. But the Scarf is blue, not white. The note says white, so the victim should have been wearing a white scarf. Therefore, the scarf in the photo (white) and the found scarf (blue) are different, indicating that the found scarf isn't the victim's. Therefore, the Scarf (Evidence 5) contradicts Testimony 1 (photo shows the vic wearing the scarf). But in Testimony 1, Gumshoe says the photo shows the vic wearing the scarf (which should be white per the note), but the found scarf is blue, so there's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 5 (Scarf) contradicts Testimony 1. But Edgeworth says the scarf isn't exactly white. So maybe the contradiction is between the Victim's Note (white) and the Scarf (blue), but that's between two evidences. The user wants evidence and testimony.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The key contradiction that Mia points out is about the scarf. In the transcript, when she cross-examines Gumshoe about the photo and the note, she points out that the victim's note says to wear a white scarf, but the photo in the trunk doesn't show the scarf. The scarf was found on the bridge, but it's blue. Edgeworth then presents the scarf, which is blue and muddy. So the contradiction is between the note (white scarf) and the found scarf (blue). But in the testimonies, Testimony 1 says the photo shows the vic wearing the scarf (which should be white), but the scarf found is blue, implying either the photo's scarf is different or the found scarf is not the victim's. But Edgeworth explains it away by saying it's close enough. However, in the game, the real contradiction is that the victim's coat in the trunk is dry, but the scarf is muddy. If the murder happened on the bridge in the rain, the coat should be wet. But the coat in the trunk is dry, implying she was killed elsewhere. Therefore, the dry coat (Crime Photo, Evidence 4) contradicts the testimony that the murder happened on the bridge in the rain (Testimony 2 and 3). But specifically, the coat's dryness contradicts the drizzling weather (Testimony 2). Therefore, Evidence 4 (Crime Photo) contradicts Testimony 2 (drizzling). But looking at the actual game's solution, the correct contradiction is that the coat is dry despite the rain, which means she wasn't killed on the bridge. Therefore, the correct pair would be Evidence 4 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3 (stabbing on the bridge in the rain). Because if she was stabbed there, her coat would be wet. But in the photo, it's dry. So the answer is {\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 3}."

I never... I never lie! I din't escape from nowhere!Mia: Err... But, Mr. Fawles... The police just recaptured you two days ago.Fawles: ... Ugh. Sorry.

I din't kill her! I could never do that!Mia: (Two days ago, he escaped from the police wagon when it crashed... Then about 8 hours later... A policewoman was murdered before the police could recapture him. The police believe that Terry Fawles did it.) Umm... After you escaped, did you meet a policewoman?Fawles: ... Yeah... I did. ...She's the reason I escaped.Mia: (So that much is true... He did meet with the victim.)Fawles: But I din't kill her! She was alive when I left! She was alive...!

Why are you here????: I came to see how our little kitten was doing all alone in the big, scary lion's den. ...I thought maybe you'd like someone to play with.Mia: Err, where is Mr. Grossberg????: Ha...! That old man is probably still in bed. I bet he's clutching an empty bottle and mumbling in his sleep.Armando: Aren't I good enough? After all, it's me... Diego Armando!Mia: I-I didn't say... So, Diego Armando, the finest attorney at Grossberg Law Offices, is here for me...?Armando: No, no, no... You've got it all wrong! Today, YOU'RE the finest!

I'm Mia Fey.Edgeworth: Miles Edgeworth... Your Honor.Judge: So you're the new prosecutor everyone is talking about, eh? They say you joined the prosecutor's office at quite an early age.Edgeworth: At 20... Your Honor.Armando: I guess our little kitten hasn't earned herself much of a reputation yet, huh?Mia: (Come on, Mia! You can't lose! Not to someone younger than you!)Edgeworth: ...Hmph.Judge: Young people running a trial. I'm not too sure how I feel about that. ...Now then, the defendant in this case is currently a felon on death row. Two days ago, he escaped from a police wagon. Is that correct?Edgeworth: Precisely.Armando: But the defendant is not on trial for escaping prison. On the day that the defendant escaped, a policewoman was murdered...Mia: So we're here to determine if Mr. Fawles was responsible for her death...?Armando: You got it, Kitten.Judge: Well then, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's hear your opening statement.Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor. It was five years ago. The defendant, Terry Fawles, was sentenced to death in this very court. His crimes were kidnapping, extortion... and murder. The girl he threw off the bridge was only 14 years old.Judge: A truly horrible crime. I remember it well. There was no decisive evidence, so the trial was long and protracted.Edgeworth: Correct. But in the end, what finally decided the case was... ...a certain witness's testimony.Mia: A witness's testimony...Edgeworth: The testimony of Detective Valerie Hawthorne; the person who confronted this criminal. She arrested Mr. Fawles at the scene and later testified against him. She said she witnessed Mr. Fawles throw his young victim into the river. For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered...Mia: (So Ms. Hawthorne's testimony was the one that put him away...)Judge: That policewoman you just mentioned... That wouldn't be...?Edgeworth: Exactly. The victim. The same woman that was killed 2 days ago... Police Sergeant... Valerie Hawthorne.Judge: Aha...! I see... The man who was sentenced to death based on her testimony escaped two days ago... ...with only one thing on his mind. To take revenge against the woman who convicted him. ... Hmm... Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!Mia: Huh?Judge: Yes, yes... It's quite obvious that the defendant is guilty.Mia:Mia: W-Wait a minute! That's not right! At least hear the case before you decide on the outcome, Your Honor!Judge: Grrrngh... Watch yourself, Ms. Fey! I'm not sure I care for your word choice, or your tone of voice.Edgeworth: Young people these days simply don't know how to respect their elders.Mia: (Why you...! You're even younger than me, you hypocrite!)Judge: Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, please call your first witness.Edgeworth: I call the detective who was in charge of the initial investigation of this case.Edgeworth: Witness... State your name and occupation.Gumshoe: Gumshoe. Dick Gumshoe. I'm the homicide detective in charge of the case, sir! I finally got promoted to the detective division half a year ago!Mia: I don't believe anyone asked you about that.Gumshoe: Hey, ma'am! You got any idea how much work it takes... ......Mia: Wh-What is it?Gumshoe: You... Y-You're really gorgeous...Mia: Excuse me?Gumshoe: No, seriously... My heart... It's aching for you...Edgeworth: Detective. Pull yourself together and try to be professional. Otherwise... I'll write you up on contempt so quick that something other than your heart will ache!Gumshoe: Urk... O-OK, I-I got it!Judge: ...Now, Detective. Tell us about the incident.Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Right away! The victim was Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, a veteran on the police force. She was stabbed in the back with a knife and died from excessive blood loss.Judge: That much is already stated in the autopsy report. The court would like to hear more details about the incident itself.Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I gotcha! OK! Let's take a look at this aerial map of the area here! This is a sketch of Dusky Bridge, an old suspension bridge. And the river that runs under there is Eagle River. The victim and the defendant met there... On top of the bridge. After stabbing her in the back, the killer carried the victim back to his car. He was recaptured at a police checkpoint as he was trying to make his getaway, sir.Judge: Hmm... I see...Dusky Bridge Map added to the Court Record.Judge: Was the victim's blood found on the bridge?Gumshoe: The victim, Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, was wearing a thick coat, sir. Unfortunately, no traces of blood were found on the bridge.Judge: Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth. I warn you that I absolutely despise conjecture. If there was no blood on the bridge, then you have no proof that they even met there!Edgeworth: Your Honor. If you would listen to the testimony we have prepared, I'm sure you'll be convinced. The two of them most certainly did meet on the bridge that day...Judge: Why, Mr. Edgeworth... I'm not sure I like you wagging your finger at me as though I were some hoser! Detective, proceed with your testimony!Gumshoe: Um... Yes, sir!Mia: (Here we go, Mia! Hang on...!)Armando: OK now... Listen carefully, Kitten. One little mistake and this guy will drink you for morning tea! Trust me and get ready.Witness Testimony-- Summary of the Incident --Gumshoe: On the day of the incident, an unknown person phoned the sergeant and asked to meet. Sergeant Hawthorne went to Dusky Bridge at the designated time and met with Mr. Fawles. And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir. The criminal stuffed her body into his car trunk and tried to make a getaway. Mr. Fawles was arrested at a police checkpoint we set up at the base of the mountain.Judge: Hmm... Well, you certainly have established the importance of the bridge.Edgeworth: ...Naturally.Judge: Now, would the defense please hurry up and proceed with the cross-examination.Mia: Y-Yes, Your Honor! C-C-Cross-examination... Coming right up!Armando: Hey, hey! Settle down there, Kitten! If you keep trembling like that, you're gonna make me spill my coffee!Mia: I-I-I'm not t-trembling! It-It-It's just cold in here!Armando: The courtroom can be a cold battlefield alright. Especially... for a beginner.Mia: I-I don't need you to worry about me...! I mean... I mean, the defendant, the witness... everyone's a beginner in here!Armando: Ha...! You got me there. But maybe you should keep your claws out, and show them what you've got... Kitten.Mia: (It's OK, Mia. Stay calm... Just remember those court procedure videos you stayed up all last night watching!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Summary of the Incident --Gumshoe: On the day of the incident, an unknown person phoned the sergeant and asked to meet.Press Mia: Mia: This \"unknown person\"... You have no idea who it might be, right? Gumshoe: Sorry, but I'm afraid I do! Mia: What...? Gumshoe: The one who called Sergeant Hawthorne was the defendant, Terry Fawles! Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaat! The defendant...! The defendant called her!? Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne was a very thorough person, sir! She left a note about her phone call with Mr. Fawles. Mia: A note...? Gumshoe: Yeah, a top-secret memo that she left on her desk. Victim's Note added to the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... According to this note, it seems the one who called her to the bridge was indeed... ...the defendant, Terry Fawles! Mia: Nngh! (Whose bright idea was it to keep that note from me!?) Armando: Ha...! Looks like the judge is even more sure of his verdict now. Listen up! Never ask a question if you don't already know the answer! Mia: (It's that detective's fault! He's the one that said, \"unknown person\"...!) Gumshoe: Hey now! Don't make that face at me! I just said it that way 'cause the prosecutor told me to! Mia: (Was that... a trap...? ...With that cute face, I didn't expect him to be so sneaky.) Edgeworth: Hmph.Press (subsequent times) Mia: Mia: This \"unknown person\"... You have no idea who it might be, right? Gumshoe: Sorry, but I'm afraid I do! Mia: What...? Gumshoe: The one who called Sergeant Hawthorne was the defendant, Terry Fawles! Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaat!

Edgeworth: Hmph.Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne went to Dusky Bridge at the designated time and met with Mr. Fawles.Press Mia: Mia: A bridge up in the mountains? But why meet there? Gumshoe: Because it is a very important place to the defendant, that's why. Judge: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: If you remember, 5 years ago, the defendant kidnapped a young girl. He was chased onto a bridge... And it was there that he killed his hostage. And the place where all of this occurred is, of course, Dusky Bridge. Mia: ...!

How nostalgic.Gumshoe: And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir.Press Mia: Mia: Was the body of the victim discovered right away? Gumshoe: Yeah. We were really on the ball. We found the criminal within one hour of the murder. It was great! We even got to say, \"Don't move! We've got you surrounded!\" Mia: (...Wait a second. Isn't there something weird about that...?) Armando: The location was a suspension bridge, up in the mountains. So how did they find out about the crime so quickly...? Mia: Sergeant Hawthorne must have mentioned the phone call to someone else, right? Armando: Ha...! If that's what had happened, then she wouldn't have been killed. Gumshoe: She never mentioned the phone call from Mr. Fawles. But... She left a note on her desk about it. If only I had noticed it earlier... Maybe she'd still be alive.

Gumshoe: No, no, of course not. ...It was stolen. He stole it from a young couple that had been waiting at a red light. Judge: Hmm... Car thieves... I'm not sure how I feel about car thieves.

The defendant...! The defendant called her!? Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne was a very thorough person, sir! She left a note about her phone call with Mr. Fawles. Mia: A note...? Gumshoe: Yeah, a top-secret memo that she left on her desk. Victim's Note added to the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... According to this note, it seems the one who called her to the bridge was indeed... ...the defendant, Terry Fawles! Mia: Nngh! (Whose bright idea was it to keep that note from me!?) Armando: Ha...!

Come on, Mia! Shake it off! You're a lawyer!) Detective!Gumshoe: Y-Yes, ma'am!Mia: This photo... You said that there was nothing peculiar about it. ...Is that correct?Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, that's what I said!Mia: Well then, I suggest you take another look at the note written by the victim!Gumshoe: The n-n-note...?Mia: It very clearly says, \"Wear white scarf for identification.\"... The caller must have forgotten what the victim looked like. Thus, this special request.Gumshoe: Aaah... I, umm...!Mia: I have one very simple question for you, Detective. Where is the white scarf? I can't seem to find it in this photo...Gumshoe: Um... Well, to be honest, we didn't find it in the trunk, ma'am...Mia: And you stopped there!? You should have looked for it!Gumshoe: Aaaaaaarrrggg...!Judge: The caller told her to wear it to identify herself, so I'd expect she did just that! Well, Mr. Edgeworth!? What do you have to say about this!?Edgeworth: *sigh* I see the defense is a little... lacking.Mia: ...!Edgeworth: The scarf you are searching so desperately for... ...Is it this one, perchance?Mia: ...Ah!Gumshoe: Wh-Where did you find that, sir!?Edgeworth: On Dusky Bridge. I was there first, and decided to conduct my own investigation.Gumshoe: Wh-Why...? Why didn't you tell me?Edgeworth: I made a decision to keep all pieces of evidence in my personal satchel. It's the safest place I know.Armando: Hmph! That hot-shot sure has a flair for the dramatic...Edgeworth: It's not exactly \"white\", as the caller requested... But as you can see, it's close enough, for what it was intended for.Judge: Hmmm... It looks like it spent some time in the mud.Edgeworth: Not surprising... It was drizzling on the mountain that day.Mia: (Prosecutor Edgeworth... He was intentionally hiding that scarf the whole time!)Judge: The court will accept the scarf into evidence.Scarf added to the Court Record.Edgeworth: Now, if the attorney for the defense is finished embarrassing herself... ...I'd like to move on with the testimony. That IS alright with you, isn't it, Ms. Fey?Mia: (Boy would I like to wrap this scarf around his smarmy little neck...)Edgeworth: Very good. Now, if we're done with this mud-covered scarf business... ...the prosecution moves to establish conclusively, and with hard evidence that... ...Ms. Hawthorne and Mr. Fawles did indeed meet on that bridge that day. Further, we will show exactly what occurred there.Judge: That sounds quite promising. I can't wait to hear all about it.Mia: (Argh... Everything is moving at his whim...)Armando: Don't forget, Kitten. There's a reason why everyone considers this kid a genius.Mia: (A genius, huh...)Witness Testimony-- Events on Dusky Bridge --Gumshoe: Actually, there's an eyewitness who was there when the incident took place. This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows the vic wearing the scarf, sir. (Changed from [This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows her wearing the scarf, sir.] in the original release) It was drizzling that day; unfortunately, it's a little hard to see what's going on. Anyway, the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back! ...That must have been when the scarf fell off.Judge: Hmm. Looking at this photo... ...you really get the sense that this bridge is very high up.Edgeworth: It is about a 40 feet drop from the bridge to the Eagle River down below.Judge: Mr. Edgeworth, who took this photo anyway?Edgeworth: Let's just say that it was a well-intentioned third party.Judge: Aha! A potential witness! So why isn't this person in the courtroom?Gumshoe: Well... They said they absolutely did not want to testify.Edgeworth: ...The person in question is very delicate, Your Honor. Besides, as long as we have this photo, we see no reason to compel her to testify.Judge: ... I'm not sure how I feel about that!Witness's Photo added to the Court Record.Edgeworth: So, as you can see, Terry Fawles had both the motive and the opportunity. I think it's quite clear at this point what happened on that bridge.Judge: ... Hmm. Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!Mia: Huh?Judge: Yes, it's quite obvious. He's clearly guilty.Mia: N-Not again! That's not fair! I haven't even done my cross-examination yet!Judge: Hmm...Mia: (What do you mean, \"Hmm\"!?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Events on Dusky Bridge --Gumshoe: Actually, there's an eyewitness who was there when the incident took place.Press Mia: Mia: Who is this eyewitness? Gumshoe: She's a college student! Mia: A female college student...? Gumshoe: That's right! Meaning she's \"female\" AND a \"college student\", ma'am!

So, about the witness who took this photo... What was this person doing all the way in the mountains? Gumshoe: She was taking photos of wild flowers apparently. Edgeworth: There are many unusual types of flora on that mountain, Ms. Fey. People in the area say it's because of the spirits that live there. Judge: S-S-Spirits! Now that you mention it, th-this photo... This cloudy fog-like thing... Is-Is it a ghost!? I-I don't believe it! Gumshoe: No, Your Honor, no... I don't think it's a ghost.Gumshoe: It was drizzling that day; unfortunately, it's a little hard to see what's going on.Press Mia: Mia: Drizzling, huh? Gumshoe: That's right. There was a light rain coming down. The whole place was dreary... ...But not as dreary as the mood that's in this court room right now. Ha ha. Mia: ... Edgeworth: ... Judge: ...

It was really something.Gumshoe: Anyway, the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back!Press Mia: Mia: Is that part of the witness's testimony as well?

As far as I can see, there is nothing strange about it.Mia: That's exactly what's strange! Remember the testimony! What were the conditions on the bridge that day? It was drizzling and foggy. Dusky Bridge was all wet. If the victim really had fallen down on her stomach on top of the bridge... ...then the front of her coat should have been covered in mud!Gumshoe: Urk...!Edgeworth: ...!Judge: That... That's exactly right! The other day I fell on a muddy street and my gorgeous playoff beard was befouled!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: ...I do admit that the crime scene was quite wet that day. However! That doesn't mean that the top of the bridge itself was muddy! If Your Honor had fallen in the shower instead of on a muddy street... ...his glorious hockey beard, pride of the Legal League, would be wet, but not muddy!Judge: Fortunately, I have yet to test that. Still, your point is well-taken.Edgeworth: Can you prove that the surface of the bridge was muddy that day?Mia: (The surface of the bridge, huh...)Armando: Ha...! A real man wouldn't stand for a taunt like this!Mia: (Neither would a real woman!) Of course I can!Edgeworth: ...!Mia: Here is the evidence that proves the surface of the bridge was muddy!Present Scarf Mia: Leads to: \"The evidence is... this scarf!\"Present anything else Mia: Mia: The evidence is...

Like jumping off a 100-story building into a bubbling pool of magma. ...After tying a 10-ton boulder around your neck. Mia: What is THAT supposed to mean? Armando: To put it simply... It would be suicide. Mia: (Why didn't he just put it simply in the first place...?) Edgeworth: Is your little chat finished? Can we move on now? Mia: Y-Yes... I-I've changed my mind. Judge: Life is short, Ms. Fey. Hurry it up already! Mia: Yes, Your Honor! The defense is now prepared to show our evidence! Leads back to: \"Here is the evidence that proves the surface of the bridge was muddy!\"Mia: The evidence is... this scarf!Judge: Ah...!Mia: It should be obvious... If the scarf fell onto the bridge and got this muddy... It means that the bridge was obviously covered in mud!Edgeworth: Urrrnngh...! No... I can't be outwitted by this novice bimbo...!Mia: (Hey! Same to you, buddy!)Judge: Ms. Fey's assertion makes perfect sense to me...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I do admit that there appears to be a contradiction between... ...the condition of the victim's coat and her scarf. However! The real question is... why is there a contradiction?Mia: Huh?Edgeworth: For every contradiction, there exists an explanation. Let's look at what the explanation in this case may be, shall we?Mia: A-Alright...! (It's not like he's really giving me a choice here...)Armando: Ha...! You're doing pretty well. ...For a little kitten. (Changed from [You're doing pretty good. ...For a little kitten.] in the original release)Mia: M-Mr. Armando!Armando: No matter what he says, a contradiction always comes down to a lie. It's either the victim discovered in the trunk... ...the witness's photo showing the defendant and the victim... ...or the witness's testimony that stated she saw the moment of the murder. Just relax and think it over. It's pretty simple, isn't it? The false evidence... It's one of those three.Judge: Hmph! What you said just now! I'm not sure I like that!Mia: Th-That wasn't me, Your Honor! It was the coffee aficionado over here that said it!Judge: This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!Armando: Blame it on him, Your Honor. He's the one trying to slip false evidence into the court.Mia: ...!Armando: But we won't let him! We'll expose his evidence as the flimsy scam it really is!Mia: Y-Yes! The false evidence in this case is the...witness's photo. Mia: About the photo that the prosecution claims was taken by a witness... It certainly seems to show a man in a prison uniform and a woman in a coat. However! We can't tell any more than that from the photo! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you saying the people in the photo may not be the victim and the defendant? Mia: W-Well, that's certainly a possibility! Edgeworth: So perhaps it was another prisoner and policewoman? I admit, people have their quirks. Perhaps they were part of a role-playing group? Mia: W-Well, I suppose that's also p-possible... I guess... Armando: You messed up again... Kitten. Mia: M-Mr. Armando! Armando: There should be something else that's even more suspicious. Now think the whole thing over again. Judge: From this point on, Ms. Fey, I will penalize you for making unsubstantiated accusations! Mia: (Ugggh... Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry until you get home!) Judge: In any case...! Leads back to: \"This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!\"body in the trunk Mia: If the victim really did try to repel her killer and if she did fall down on the bridge... ...then you would expect her coat to be dirty. Therefore! The body that was found in the trunk of the car... It was NOT the body of Valerie Hawthorne! Judge: Wh-What do you have to say to that, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: *sigh* Objection. Judge: Hmm... Not only a whisper, but he mixed in a sigh, too. Edgeworth: Valerie Hawthorne was more than a simple meter maid; she was a sergeant. There's absolutely no chance that a mistake about her identity could be made. Mia: Uuurgh... (I guess he's right...) Judge: From this point on, Ms. Fey, I will penalize you for making unsubstantiated accusations! Mia: (Ugggh... Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry until you get home!) Judge: In any case...! Leads back to: \"This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!\"witness's testimony. Leads to: \"It is a no-brainer. Obviously it's the witness that's suspicious!\"Mia: It is a no-brainer. Obviously it's the witness that's suspicious! During his earlier testimony, the detective pointed out a crucial fact. \"The criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back.\" Now, is that testimony exactly what the witness claims to have seen?Gumshoe: Yeah. ...That's what the witness told us.Mia: That testimony... is filled with holes. After all, the victim's coat isn't dirty at all.Judge: Hmm... That's true.Armando: Ha...! It's not just true. It's the truth. If there was a truly decisive witness in this case... ...I'm certain that boy wonder over there would have called them in the first place!Mia: ...Your Honor! The defense requests to cross-examine the eyewitness! The testimony presented so far is not only vague, but contradictory as well!Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth? It appears that we'll need to hear from your mystery witness after all.Edgeworth: ... *sigh* You should brace yourself. ...For the brutal truth.Mia: ...?Edgeworth: Your Honor, the prosecution has no intention of hiding the witness from the court. We are prepared to present our witness at any time.Judge: Very well... Please bring forth your witness at this time.Mia: (What Mr. Edgeworth said... kind of worries me... What does he mean by \"the brutal truth\"?)Judge: Now, let's proceed with the testimony. Mr. Edgeworth. Please go right ahead.Edgeworth: Thank you, Your Honor. The prosecution summons... ...the woman who saw the events that day with her very own eyes.Mia: (This is it, Mia! The battle begins here!)Edgeworth: ...Witness. What is your name and occupation? ...Judge: ...Mia: (Everyone is so silent that I can hear their hearts going pitter-patter...)Judge: Hmm... Ohh... When I look at you... How can I put it...? You look as scrumptous [sic] as a double-double and a dozen doughnut holes... I feel like I want to hurry up and hand down a verdict just to have a bite...Mia: (Hey, hey! Not so fast!)Edgeworth: ...*sigh* As I said before... This witness is very sensitive and delicate. I would ask the court to please exercise care when addressing her.Judge: Yes, indeed... Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. You are a true gentleman. Ms. Fey! You could learn a lot from this man!Mia: (...If he's such a gentleman, he sure doesn't act like one to me.)???: Umm... Sir?Judge: Hmmm... Eh? Yes, my dear????: This is my first time, so I'm sure I'll make a lot of mistakes. Anyway... I just wanted to say I'm sorry for all the trouble I might cause...Judge: Hmmmmm... Not at all! It's no trouble at all!Mia: Now then... May we please have your name and occupation?Melissa: My name is, umm... ...Melissa Foster. I'm a college student... A-A freshman in the literature department.Edgeworth: You were on the scene when the unfortunate event occurred, correct?Mia: ...And you were the one who took this photo? Is that accurate?Melissa: Waaaaaah! H-How can you be so mean...?Judge: Now see here! What are you doing shoving that in her face like that!?Mia: Huh? B-But it's just a photograph! It's not like it's something dangerous!Judge: Next time I'll be forced to penalize you!Mia: (Uh oh... I don't like the turn this has taken...)Melissa: ...Mia: ...? (Is she... staring at me?)Melissa: Umm... And you would be...?Mia: Huh? I-I'm the defense attorney. ...My name is Mia Fey. (Changed form [Huh? I-I'm the defense lawyer. ...My name is Mia Fey.] in the original release)Melissa: ... ...I see. So you are...Judge: Now then, young lady. Could you please give us your testimony?Melissa: Yes, Your Honor... I-I'll do my best.Witness Testimony-- The Witness's Photograph --Melissa: I... I was using my camera to take some pictures of wild flowers. Then, I noticed there were two people standing up on the suspension bridge. Suddenly, they just started fighting! That's when I hurried and took the photo that shows the crucial moment. And right after that, I called the police.Judge: Hmm... By the way, where were you standing when the incident occurred...?Edgeworth: I believe the map would be of help here.Melissa: Umm... I was standing right over... here. [caption] I was standing to the south of the bridge. I was standing in a beautiful field, surrounded by tall cliffs.Judge: So you took the photo from that location, eh.Melissa: I brought the camera I was using at the time, just like Mr. Edgeworth asked me to.Judge: Ho ho ho. What a cute camera... Just like its owner.Camera added to the Court Record.Judge: ...Alright then, Ms. Fey. Time for your cross-examination. But I warn you, make the witness cry again, and you'll feel the wrath of my gavel.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Witness's Photograph --Melissa: I... I was using my camera to take some pictures of wild flowers.Press Mia: Mia: Did you say... \"wild flowers\"? Melissa: Yes, the mountain is famous for its beautiful spring wild flowers. Mia: Umm... But it's only February. Melissa: Well, I... I couldn't wait for Spring to come. Judge: Ho ho... I know just how you feel! It's just like when I first started growing this glorious beard of mine... I just couldn't wait, so I wore a dyed blonde Santa beard until mine grew in properly. Edgeworth: ...Would you mind if we got back to the facts of the case, Your Honor?Melissa: Then, I noticed there were two people standing up on the suspension bridge.Press Mia: Mia: Was there anything strange about the two of them? Melissa: I... I'm a bad girl. ...I know I am. It looked like they were having a really serious conversation up there... ...So I decided to watch them. Like some kind of Peeping Tom. Judge: No, not at all! Everyone is like that! I love watching other people fight, too. In fact, I can't get enough of it! ...Actually, that's why I took this job in the first place. Mia: (Too much info, Your Honor!) Edgeworth: ...In any case, it's perfectly natural for you to have kept watching them. Especially dressed as they were... Melissa: Well, anyway... I was watching them very closely.Melissa: Suddenly, they just started fighting!Press Mia: Mia: Do you have any idea what they were fighting about? Melissa: Eh? No... I have no idea. Why do you ask that? Mia: Oh, I just thought that maybe you overheard what they said... Melissa: ... Mia: ...! Melissa: I would never... I would never eavesdrop... I've got more class than that! Judge: That's right, Ms. Fey! Don't drag the witness down to your level! Mia: (Grrrr...!)Melissa: That's when I hurried and took the photo that shows the crucial moment.Press Mia: Mia: Why did you take a photo? Melissa: Well, the two of them were really going at it... Ever since I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a news reporter... I guess that part of me just kind of took over... Mia: (Smells like a lie to me...) Judge: Yes, I understand completely! Even now, I can't completely abandon my boyhood dreams... I still use my grandson to test my comedy routines on! Mia: (So he wanted to be a comedian, huh. ...Not that it has any bearing on this.) Melissa: All I could do was to use my camera. So I took the photo of the crucial moment and gave it to the police.Present Witness's Photo Mia: Mia: ...Witness. When you said you took a photo of the crucial moment,  is this what you meant? Melissa: Err... Mia: All I can see in this photo are two people facing each other. You testified that you saw the two of them starting to fight. Normally that's the kind of thing we would refer to as a crucial moment! Why haven't you presented a photo like that!? Melissa: ...W-Well, you see... Edgeworth: ...The photo we presented was the only one there was. Mia: But if you really wanted to capture the crucial moment... ...then what happened next? You must have taken a photo of it! Judge: Hm... Hmmmmm... Doh! Err... Umm... My apologies, young lady... But Ms. Fey's assertion is not without a certain amount of merit... Mia: He can certainly downplay a situation, can't he... (Was an inner monologue in the original release) Melissa: ...I-I'm sorry... ...I'm a very bad girl. I umm... I used it all up... The film, I mean. Judge: You ran out of film!? Melissa: Err, this photo was the last one. Mia: What!? Edgeworth: Unfortunately, that is the truth. ...I personally examined all of the photographs she took that day. All the other photos are of the witness herself, playing among the wild flowers. Mia: The witness herself? Then who took the photos? Melissa: Well... You see... My camera has a timer feature built into it. Mia: So, you took photos of yourself!? Judge: Hmm... I remember taking some photos of myself once, too! Mia: (Please! No details...!) Judge: ...It seems that Ms. Fey's assertion was not so decisive after all. Mia: W-Wait! Just a minute! Judge: Well, if she had no film left, she couldn't very well take more pictures, eh. Edgeworth: Ms. Foster, perhaps then you could tell us about a different sort of photo. Photos of the incident that you \"took\" with your very own eyes. Melissa: Mr. Edgeworth... You're quite the poet! Judge: Very well then! Let's get back to the cross-examination. ...Let's hear your thoughts on the fight that you witnessed! Melissa: Yes... Mr. Judge. Mia: (Boy, this guy is really a sucker for sweet talk...) Armando: Ha...! It looks like the other kitten in the room is the one that's getting all the attention. Mia: Yeah, it's sickening.

Why do you think she tried to run away? Melissa: Umm... Mia: With her police training, she certainly knew better than to turn her back on a criminal... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This was a large, powerful man with a knife. If it had been a quaggy woman like you, I'm sure she would have acted differently. Mia: (\"Quaggy\"!? Why you...!) Judge: If it had been me, I probably would have jumped into the river! Mia: (There's still something wrong with this testimony...)Present Dusky Bridge Map Mia: Leads to: \"Witness! Your testimony is a joke!\"Melissa: And right after that, I called the police.Press Mia: Mia: You called the police? Melissa: Yes. Because it looked to me like the murderer was going to try to escape. Edgeworth: ...We were already moving before the call even came in. Thanks to the victim's note, we had already started our operation. Judge: Hmm... That was certainly tough luck for the criminal, eh.Melissa: She only got about 10 yards before she was stabbed in the back.Press Mia: Mia: So you're saying Sergeant Hawthorne wasn't able to get away from him...? Melissa: Well, it's a narrow bridge and it was swaying back and forth... If you ask me, both of them were in danger of falling off. I only wish I could have done something to help her... Judge: Hmmmm... That seems to make sense. Mia: I wonder about that... Something seems kind of off... Armando: Ha...! You have a good sixth sense. When you feel that something's off, that's when you need to figure out why...Present Dusky Bridge Map Mia: Leads to: \"Witness! Your testimony is a joke!\"Mia: (If Terry Fawles isn't the criminal... Then there must be something strange in that girl's testimony!)Armando: Be careful, Kitten. That girl has the judge wrapped right around her little finger.

    "cot": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the problem is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony in the given Ace Attorney case transcript. The user provided all the characters, evidence, and testimonies.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Melissa Foster's testimony includes that she took the photo showing the crucial moment of the crime. Specifically, Testimony 3 says: \"That's when I hurried and took the photo that shows the crucial moment.\" The corresponding evidence here would be the Witness's Photo (Evidence 6), which is the photo she took.\n\nNow, looking at the details of Evidence 6: Witness's Photo. The description mentions that in the photo, the victim is wearing a scarf and a hat, standing close to the broken end of the bridge, and the man (Fawles) is in jail uniform. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the victim's coat is dry and clean, which contradicts the expected mud if she had fallen on the bridge as per the rainy conditions. But that's about another contradiction earlier. \n\nWait, the specific contradiction here is regarding Melissa's claim that she took the photo of the crucial moment. But according to the evidence, the Witness's Photo (Evidence 6) shows the victim and Fawles facing each other, not during the actual stabbing. The crucial moment would be the stabbing, but the photo doesn't show that. The actual stabbing happened after the victim tried to run away, which is covered in later testimonies. So Melissa's testimony about taking the photo of the crucial moment (the fight/stabbing) doesn't align with the photo evidence, which only shows them standing, not fighting. Therefore, the photo doesn't capture the crucial moment she described, indicating a contradiction between her testimony (Testimony 3) and the actual photo (Evidence 6).\n\nAnother angle: The camera (Evidence 7) has a timer function, and she used up all the film. The last photo was the one presented, which was not of the actual attack. So she couldn't have taken a photo of the crucial moment because the film was already used up on the prior photos, which were selfies. Therefore, her claim to have taken the crucial moment's photo is contradicted by the evidence that the photo she provided doesn't show the stabbing, only the two standing. So the photo (Evidence 6) contradicts her Testimony 3 that it shows the crucial moment."

I feel like I'm going to die. I never should've accepted this case...) Eeeeeeek! ...Ah! G-G-Good morning! (Don't be so jumpy, Mia!)???: I-I din't do nuttin'! I swear! I din't kill nobody!Mia: (Terry Fawles... ...My first client. Sentenced to death 5 years ago, and now... a prison escapee.)Fawles: ...Mia: (Just relax, Mia! Make small talk and try to relax him!) ...Err, umm... So why did you escape anyway?Fawles: Ah. Ah. UGGA!Mia: Eeeeek! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!Fawles: ...Ugh. I din't do nuttin'! I din't kill nobody! I never... I never lie! I din't escape from nowhere!Mia: Err... But, Mr. Fawles... The police just recaptured you two days ago.Fawles: ... Ugh. Sorry. I told a little lie.Mia: (Oh boy...)Fawles: But anyway, I din't do it! I never killed nobody!Mia: Umm, sorry for asking but... You're on death row, right?Fawles: Uh. Uh... UGGA!Mia: Eeeeeek! I'm really, really sorry!Fawles: They sentenced me to die 5 years ago! But I was tricked I tell you! That woman! She lied in her testimony! ...That's why I got the death penalty! I swear it! I din't kill her! I could never do that!Mia: (Two days ago, he escaped from the police wagon when it crashed... Then about 8 hours later... A policewoman was murdered before the police could recapture him. The police believe that Terry Fawles did it.) Umm... After you escaped, did you meet a policewoman?Fawles: ... Yeah... I did. ...She's the reason I escaped.Mia: (So that much is true... He did meet with the victim.)Fawles: But I din't kill her! She was alive when I left! She was alive...! It-It's true!Mia: (I can trust him... right? I mean, I should...)???: Ha...! You're not going to figure out the truth by just staring at the guy...Mia: Y-You're... Why are you here????: I came to see how our little kitten was doing all alone in the big, scary lion's den. ...I thought maybe you'd like someone to play with.Mia: Err, where is Mr. Grossberg????: Ha...! That old man is probably still in bed. I bet he's clutching an empty bottle and mumbling in his sleep.Armando: Aren't I good enough? After all, it's me... Diego Armando!Mia: I-I didn't say... So, Diego Armando, the finest attorney at Grossberg Law Offices, is here for me...?Armando: No, no, no... You've got it all wrong! Today, YOU'RE the finest! After all, it took an amazing amount of guts to take this case! Imagine... An escaped death row convict for a first client!Mia: Yeah, err... Th-Thanks. (I sure wish I could get out of it though!)Armando: Ha...! Relax. I just heard some good news. The prosecutor for today is fresh out of his diapers as well.Mia: R-Really!?Armando: However... Unlike a certain somebody who I won't mention... ...he's earned the reputation as a \"genius\" since beginning his law career.Mia: (G-Genius...?)Armando: Well, it's about time to head in, Kitten. Sharpen those claws of yours. It's go time!Mia: (A solitary confinement cell for the condemned must be the world's loneliest place. ...And that's what my client ran away from. Every other lawyer gave up on him... But not me. When I saw those overflowing eyes and heard that simple, child-like voice... I just had the feeling that he was telling the truth.)February 16, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Terry Fawles.Mia: The defense is ready, Your Honor.???: The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.Judge: I understand the lawyers for both sides are newcomers...?Mia: Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm Mia Fey.Edgeworth: Miles Edgeworth... Your Honor.Judge: So you're the new prosecutor everyone is talking about, eh? They say you joined the prosecutor's office at quite an early age.Edgeworth: At 20... Your Honor.Armando: I guess our little kitten hasn't earned herself much of a reputation yet, huh?Mia: (Come on, Mia! You can't lose! Not to someone younger than you!)Edgeworth: ...Hmph.Judge: Young people running a trial. I'm not too sure how I feel about that. ...Now then, the defendant in this case is currently a felon on death row. Two days ago, he escaped from a police wagon. Is that correct?Edgeworth: Precisely.Armando: But the defendant is not on trial for escaping prison. On the day that the defendant escaped, a policewoman was murdered...Mia: So we're here to determine if Mr. Fawles was responsible for her death...?Armando: You got it, Kitten.Judge: Well then, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's hear your opening statement.Edgeworth: Yes, Your Honor. It was five years ago. The defendant, Terry Fawles, was sentenced to death in this very court. His crimes were kidnapping, extortion... and murder. The girl he threw off the bridge was only 14 years old.Judge: A truly horrible crime. I remember it well. There was no decisive evidence, so the trial was long and protracted.Edgeworth: Correct. But in the end, what finally decided the case was... ...a certain witness's testimony.Mia: A witness's testimony...Edgeworth: The testimony of Detective Valerie Hawthorne; the person who confronted this criminal. She arrested Mr. Fawles at the scene and later testified against him. She said she witnessed Mr. Fawles throw his young victim into the river. For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered...Mia: (So Ms. Hawthorne's testimony was the one that put him away...)Judge: That policewoman you just mentioned... That wouldn't be...?Edgeworth: Exactly. The victim. The same woman that was killed 2 days ago... Police Sergeant... Valerie Hawthorne.Judge: Aha...! I see... The man who was sentenced to death based on her testimony escaped two days ago... ...with only one thing on his mind. To take revenge against the woman who convicted him. ... Hmm... Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!Mia: Huh?Judge: Yes, yes... It's quite obvious that the defendant is guilty.Mia:Mia: W-Wait a minute! That's not right! At least hear the case before you decide on the outcome, Your Honor!Judge: Grrrngh... Watch yourself, Ms. Fey! I'm not sure I care for your word choice, or your tone of voice.Edgeworth: Young people these days simply don't know how to respect their elders.Mia: (Why you...! You're even younger than me, you hypocrite!)Judge: Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, please call your first witness.Edgeworth: I call the detective who was in charge of the initial investigation of this case.Edgeworth: Witness... State your name and occupation.Gumshoe: Gumshoe. Dick Gumshoe. I'm the homicide detective in charge of the case, sir! I finally got promoted to the detective division half a year ago!Mia: I don't believe anyone asked you about that.Gumshoe: Hey, ma'am! You got any idea how much work it takes... ......Mia: Wh-What is it?Gumshoe: You... Y-You're really gorgeous...Mia: Excuse me?Gumshoe: No, seriously... My heart... It's aching for you...Edgeworth: Detective. Pull yourself together and try to be professional. Otherwise... I'll write you up on contempt so quick that something other than your heart will ache!Gumshoe: Urk... O-OK, I-I got it!Judge: ...Now, Detective. Tell us about the incident.Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Right away! The victim was Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, a veteran on the police force. She was stabbed in the back with a knife and died from excessive blood loss.Judge: That much is already stated in the autopsy report. The court would like to hear more details about the incident itself.Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I gotcha! OK! Let's take a look at this aerial map of the area here! This is a sketch of Dusky Bridge, an old suspension bridge. And the river that runs under there is Eagle River. The victim and the defendant met there... On top of the bridge. After stabbing her in the back, the killer carried the victim back to his car. He was recaptured at a police checkpoint as he was trying to make his getaway, sir.Judge: Hmm... I see...Dusky Bridge Map added to the Court Record.Judge: Was the victim's blood found on the bridge?Gumshoe: The victim, Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, was wearing a thick coat, sir. Unfortunately, no traces of blood were found on the bridge.Judge: Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth. I warn you that I absolutely despise conjecture. If there was no blood on the bridge, then you have no proof that they even met there!Edgeworth: Your Honor. If you would listen to the testimony we have prepared, I'm sure you'll be convinced. The two of them most certainly did meet on the bridge that day...Judge: Why, Mr. Edgeworth... I'm not sure I like you wagging your finger at me as though I were some hoser! Detective, proceed with your testimony!Gumshoe: Um... Yes, sir!Mia: (Here we go, Mia! Hang on...!)Armando: OK now... Listen carefully, Kitten. One little mistake and this guy will drink you for morning tea! Trust me and get ready.Witness Testimony-- Summary of the Incident --Gumshoe: On the day of the incident, an unknown person phoned the sergeant and asked to meet. Sergeant Hawthorne went to Dusky Bridge at the designated time and met with Mr. Fawles. And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir. The criminal stuffed her body into his car trunk and tried to make a getaway. Mr. Fawles was arrested at a police checkpoint we set up at the base of the mountain.Judge: Hmm... Well, you certainly have established the importance of the bridge.Edgeworth: ...Naturally.Judge: Now, would the defense please hurry up and proceed with the cross-examination.Mia: Y-Yes, Your Honor! C-C-Cross-examination... Coming right up!Armando: Hey, hey! Settle down there, Kitten! If you keep trembling like that, you're gonna make me spill my coffee!Mia: I-I-I'm not t-trembling! It-It-It's just cold in here!Armando: The courtroom can be a cold battlefield alright. Especially... for a beginner.Mia: I-I don't need you to worry about me...! I mean... I mean, the defendant, the witness... everyone's a beginner in here!Armando: Ha...! You got me there. But maybe you should keep your claws out, and show them what you've got... Kitten.Mia: (It's OK, Mia. Stay calm... Just remember those court procedure videos you stayed up all last night watching!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Summary of the Incident --Gumshoe: On the day of the incident, an unknown person phoned the sergeant and asked to meet.Press Mia: Mia: This \"unknown person\"... You have no idea who it might be, right? Gumshoe: Sorry, but I'm afraid I do! Mia: What...? Gumshoe: The one who called Sergeant Hawthorne was the defendant, Terry Fawles! Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaat! The defendant...! The defendant called her!? Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne was a very thorough person, sir! She left a note about her phone call with Mr. Fawles. Mia: A note...? Gumshoe: Yeah, a top-secret memo that she left on her desk. Victim's Note added to the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... According to this note, it seems the one who called her to the bridge was indeed... ...the defendant, Terry Fawles! Mia: Nngh! (Whose bright idea was it to keep that note from me!?) Armando: Ha...! Looks like the judge is even more sure of his verdict now. Listen up! Never ask a question if you don't already know the answer! Mia: (It's that detective's fault!

Edgeworth: Hmph.Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne went to Dusky Bridge at the designated time and met with Mr. Fawles.Press Mia: Mia: A bridge up in the mountains? But why meet there? Gumshoe: Because it is a very important place to the defendant, that's why. Judge: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: If you remember, 5 years ago, the defendant kidnapped a young girl. He was chased onto a bridge... And it was there that he killed his hostage. And the place where all of this occurred is, of course, Dusky Bridge. Mia: ...!

How nostalgic.Gumshoe: And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir.Press Mia: Mia: Was the body of the victim discovered right away? Gumshoe: Yeah. We were really on the ball. We found the criminal within one hour of the murder. It was great! We even got to say, \"Don't move! We've got you surrounded!\" Mia: (...Wait a second. Isn't there something weird about that...?) Armando: The location was a suspension bridge, up in the mountains. So how did they find out about the crime so quickly...? Mia: Sergeant Hawthorne must have mentioned the phone call to someone else, right? Armando: Ha...! If that's what had happened, then she wouldn't have been killed. Gumshoe: She never mentioned the phone call from Mr. Fawles. But... She left a note on her desk about it. If only I had noticed it earlier... Maybe she'd still be alive. Mia: (I wonder why she didn't mention the phone call to anyone...?)Gumshoe: The criminal stuffed her body into his car trunk and tried to make a getaway.Press Mia: Mia: Mr. Fawles had a car, then? Gumshoe: Well, that bridge is way up in the mountains, ma'am. The defendant and the victim both went up there by car. I mean, how else, right? Judge: What! You mean the defendant drove his own car? Gumshoe: No, no, of course not. ...It was stolen. He stole it from a young couple that had been waiting at a red light. Judge: Hmm... Car thieves... I'm not sure how I feel about car thieves.

The caller must have forgotten what the victim looked like. Thus, this special request.Gumshoe: Aaah... I, umm...!Mia: I have one very simple question for you, Detective. Where is the white scarf? I can't seem to find it in this photo...Gumshoe: Um... Well, to be honest, we didn't find it in the trunk, ma'am...Mia: And you stopped there!? You should have looked for it!Gumshoe: Aaaaaaarrrggg...!Judge: The caller told her to wear it to identify herself, so I'd expect she did just that! Well, Mr. Edgeworth!?

I was there first, and decided to conduct my own investigation.Gumshoe: Wh-Why...? Why didn't you tell me?Edgeworth: I made a decision to keep all pieces of evidence in my personal satchel. It's the safest place I know.Armando: Hmph! That hot-shot sure has a flair for the dramatic...Edgeworth: It's not exactly \"white\", as the caller requested... But as you can see, it's close enough, for what it was intended for.Judge: Hmmm... It looks like it spent some time in the mud.Edgeworth: Not surprising... It was drizzling on the mountain that day.Mia: (Prosecutor Edgeworth... He was intentionally hiding that scarf the whole time!)Judge: The court will accept the scarf into evidence.Scarf added to the Court Record.Edgeworth: Now, if the attorney for the defense is finished embarrassing herself... ...I'd like to move on with the testimony. That IS alright with you, isn't it, Ms. Fey?Mia: (Boy would I like to wrap this scarf around his smarmy little neck...)Edgeworth: Very good. Now, if we're done with this mud-covered scarf business... ...the prosecution moves to establish conclusively, and with hard evidence that... ...Ms. Hawthorne and Mr. Fawles did indeed meet on that bridge that day. Further, we will show exactly what occurred there.Judge: That sounds quite promising. I can't wait to hear all about it.Mia: (Argh... Everything is moving at his whim...)Armando: Don't forget, Kitten. There's a reason why everyone considers this kid a genius.Mia: (A genius, huh...)Witness Testimony-- Events on Dusky Bridge --Gumshoe: Actually, there's an eyewitness who was there when the incident took place. This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows the vic wearing the scarf, sir. (Changed from [This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows her wearing the scarf, sir.] in the original release) It was drizzling that day; unfortunately, it's a little hard to see what's going on. Anyway, the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back! ...That must have been when the scarf fell off.Judge: Hmm. Looking at this photo... ...you really get the sense that this bridge is very high up.Edgeworth: It is about a 40 feet drop from the bridge to the Eagle River down below.Judge: Mr. Edgeworth, who took this photo anyway?Edgeworth: Let's just say that it was a well-intentioned third party.Judge: Aha! A potential witness! So why isn't this person in the courtroom?Gumshoe: Well... They said they absolutely did not want to testify.Edgeworth: ...The person in question is very delicate, Your Honor. Besides, as long as we have this photo, we see no reason to compel her to testify.Judge: ... I'm not sure how I feel about that!Witness's Photo added to the Court Record.Edgeworth: So, as you can see, Terry Fawles had both the motive and the opportunity. I think it's quite clear at this point what happened on that bridge.Judge: ... Hmm. Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!Mia: Huh?Judge: Yes, it's quite obvious. He's clearly guilty.Mia: N-Not again! That's not fair!

I had no idea there was a photo.Mia: S-So what do I do...\u00a0?Armando: You really still believe him? Mr. Crybaby, I mean?Mia: Of course I do!Armando: Hmph...! So the little kitten believes in fairy tales, huh... In that case, the answer is obvious. If what you believe is the truth... ...then that means that somewhere, hidden in that testimony, is a contradiction. One huge contradiction waiting to be discovered. ...That's your chance.Mia: So at the time of the crime, there was a light drizzle coming down, correct?Gumshoe: Yeah, and fog, too. Just a generally soggy atmosphere.Mia: Well, I have evidence that doesn't go with the soggy atmosphere.Judge: But this is a photo of the victim's body that was found in the car trunk.Mia: Considering the conditions at the scene of the crime, something isn't right.Edgeworth: ...Judge: Well by all means... Please enlighten us as to what isn't right! What is it about this photo of the trunk that doesn't fit with the conditions that day?Present victim's coat Mia: Leads to: \"Naturally the answer is... right here!\"Present anywhere else Mia: Mia: Naturally, the answer is... right around HERE! ...I think. Judge: ...Well, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: It seems to me that Ms. Fey could use a trunk herself. Mia: What...? Edgeworth: One that she could hide all her bitter memories from this trial in, that is. Judge: Ho ho ho ho ho... You truly are a genius... A genius of sarcasm and word-play. Mia: (Oops! It looks like I really put my foot in my mouth that time!) Armando: Just relax. Lick your wounds clean and then go after him again, Kitten. No matter how bitter the memory... It can never be as bitter as dark black coffee. Mia: (Alright, Mia! You have got to think harder this time!) Judge: Now then, let me ask you one more time... Leads back to: \"What is it about this photo of the trunk that doesn't fit with the conditions that day?\"Mia: Naturally the answer is... right here!Judge: The victim's... coat? As far as I can see, there is nothing strange about it.Mia: That's exactly what's strange! Remember the testimony! What were the conditions on the bridge that day? It was drizzling and foggy. Dusky Bridge was all wet. If the victim really had fallen down on her stomach on top of the bridge... ...then the front of her coat should have been covered in mud!Gumshoe: Urk...!Edgeworth: ...!Judge: That... That's exactly right! The other day I fell on a muddy street and my gorgeous playoff beard was befouled!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: ...I do admit that the crime scene was quite wet that day. However! That doesn't mean that the top of the bridge itself was muddy! If Your Honor had fallen in the shower instead of on a muddy street... ...his glorious hockey beard, pride of the Legal League, would be wet, but not muddy!Judge: Fortunately, I have yet to test that. Still, your point is well-taken.Edgeworth: Can you prove that the surface of the bridge was muddy that day?Mia: (The surface of the bridge, huh...)Armando: Ha...! A real man wouldn't stand for a taunt like this!Mia: (Neither would a real woman!) Of course I can!Edgeworth: ...!Mia: Here is the evidence that proves the surface of the bridge was muddy!Present Scarf Mia: Leads to: \"The evidence is... this scarf!\"Present anything else Mia: Mia: The evidence is... Armando: Wait a minute. Mia: Wh-What is it? Your timing is terrible...! Armando: If you present that evidence, it would be like... Like jumping off a 100-story building into a bubbling pool of magma. ...After tying a 10-ton boulder around your neck. Mia: What is THAT supposed to mean? Armando: To put it simply... It would be suicide. Mia: (Why didn't he just put it simply in the first place...?) Edgeworth: Is your little chat finished? Can we move on now? Mia: Y-Yes... I-I've changed my mind. Judge: Life is short, Ms. Fey. Hurry it up already! Mia: Yes, Your Honor! The defense is now prepared to show our evidence! Leads back to: \"Here is the evidence that proves the surface of the bridge was muddy!\"Mia: The evidence is... this scarf!Judge: Ah...!Mia: It should be obvious... If the scarf fell onto the bridge and got this muddy... It means that the bridge was obviously covered in mud!Edgeworth: Urrrnngh...! No... I can't be outwitted by this novice bimbo...!Mia: (Hey! Same to you, buddy!)Judge: Ms. Fey's assertion makes perfect sense to me...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I do admit that there appears to be a contradiction between... ...the condition of the victim's coat and her scarf. However! The real question is... why is there a contradiction?Mia: Huh?Edgeworth: For every contradiction, there exists an explanation. Let's look at what the explanation in this case may be, shall we?Mia: A-Alright...! (It's not like he's really giving me a choice here...)Armando: Ha...! You're doing pretty well. ...For a little kitten. (Changed from [You're doing pretty good. ...For a little kitten.] in the original release)Mia: M-Mr. Armando!Armando: No matter what he says, a contradiction always comes down to a lie. It's either the victim discovered in the trunk... ...the witness's photo showing the defendant and the victim... ...or the witness's testimony that stated she saw the moment of the murder. Just relax and think it over. It's pretty simple, isn't it? The false evidence... It's one of those three.Judge: Hmph! What you said just now! I'm not sure I like that!Mia: Th-That wasn't me, Your Honor! It was the coffee aficionado over here that said it!Judge: This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!Armando: Blame it on him, Your Honor. He's the one trying to slip false evidence into the court.Mia: ...!Armando: But we won't let him! We'll expose his evidence as the flimsy scam it really is!Mia: Y-Yes! The false evidence in this case is the...witness's photo. Mia: About the photo that the prosecution claims was taken by a witness... It certainly seems to show a man in a prison uniform and a woman in a coat. However! We can't tell any more than that from the photo! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you saying the people in the photo may not be the victim and the defendant? Mia: W-Well, that's certainly a possibility! Edgeworth: So perhaps it was another prisoner and policewoman? I admit, people have their quirks. Perhaps they were part of a role-playing group? Mia: W-Well, I suppose that's also p-possible... I guess... Armando: You messed up again... Kitten. Mia: M-Mr. Armando! Armando: There should be something else that's even more suspicious. Now think the whole thing over again. Judge: From this point on, Ms. Fey, I will penalize you for making unsubstantiated accusations! Mia: (Ugggh... Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry until you get home!) Judge: In any case...! Leads back to: \"This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!\"body in the trunk Mia: If the victim really did try to repel her killer and if she did fall down on the bridge... ...then you would expect her coat to be dirty. Therefore! The body that was found in the trunk of the car... It was NOT the body of Valerie Hawthorne! Judge: Wh-What do you have to say to that, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: *sigh* Objection. Judge: Hmm... Not only a whisper, but he mixed in a sigh, too. Edgeworth: Valerie Hawthorne was more than a simple meter maid; she was a sergeant. There's absolutely no chance that a mistake about her identity could be made. Mia: Uuurgh... (I guess he's right...) Judge: From this point on, Ms. Fey, I will penalize you for making unsubstantiated accusations! Mia: (Ugggh... Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry until you get home!) Judge: In any case...! Leads back to: \"This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!\"witness's testimony. Leads to: \"It is a no-brainer. Obviously it's the witness that's suspicious!\"Mia: It is a no-brainer. Obviously it's the witness that's suspicious! During his earlier testimony, the detective pointed out a crucial fact. \"The criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back.\" Now, is that testimony exactly what the witness claims to have seen?Gumshoe: Yeah. ...That's what the witness told us.Mia: That testimony... is filled with holes. After all, the victim's coat isn't dirty at all.Judge: Hmm... That's true.Armando: Ha...! It's not just true. It's the truth. If there was a truly decisive witness in this case... ...I'm certain that boy wonder over there would have called them in the first place!Mia: ...Your Honor! The defense requests to cross-examine the eyewitness! The testimony presented so far is not only vague, but contradictory as well!Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth? It appears that we'll need to hear from your mystery witness after all.Edgeworth: ... *sigh* You should brace yourself. ...For the brutal truth.Mia: ...?Edgeworth: Your Honor, the prosecution has no intention of hiding the witness from the court. We are prepared to present our witness at any time.Judge: Very well... Please bring forth your witness at this time.Mia: (What Mr. Edgeworth said... kind of worries me... What does he mean by \"the brutal truth\"?)Judge: Now, let's proceed with the testimony. Mr. Edgeworth. Please go right ahead.Edgeworth: Thank you, Your Honor. The prosecution summons... ...the woman who saw the events that day with her very own eyes.Mia: (This is it, Mia! The battle begins here!)Edgeworth: ...Witness. What is your name and occupation? ...Judge: ...Mia: (Everyone is so silent that I can hear their hearts going pitter-patter...)Judge: Hmm... Ohh... When I look at you... How can I put it...? You look as scrumptous [sic] as a double-double and a dozen doughnut holes... I feel like I want to hurry up and hand down a verdict just to have a bite...Mia: (Hey, hey! Not so fast!)Edgeworth: ...*sigh* As I said before... This witness is very sensitive and delicate. I would ask the court to please exercise care when addressing her.Judge: Yes, indeed... Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. You are a true gentleman. Ms. Fey! You could learn a lot from this man!Mia: (...If he's such a gentleman, he sure doesn't act like one to me.)???: Umm... Sir?Judge: Hmmm... Eh? Yes, my dear????: This is my first time, so I'm sure I'll make a lot of mistakes. Anyway... I just wanted to say I'm sorry for all the trouble I might cause...Judge: Hmmmmm... Not at all! It's no trouble at all!Mia: Now then... May we please have your name and occupation?Melissa: My name is, umm... ...Melissa Foster. I'm a college student... A-A freshman in the literature department.Edgeworth: You were on the scene when the unfortunate event occurred, correct?Mia: ...And you were the one who took this photo? Is that accurate?Melissa: Waaaaaah! H-How can you be so mean...?Judge: Now see here! What are you doing shoving that in her face like that!?Mia: Huh? B-But it's just a photograph! It's not like it's something dangerous!Judge: Next time I'll be forced to penalize you!Mia: (Uh oh... I don't like the turn this has taken...)Melissa: ...Mia: ...? (Is she... staring at me?)Melissa: Umm... And you would be...?Mia: Huh? I-I'm the defense attorney. ...My name is Mia Fey. (Changed form [Huh? I-I'm the defense lawyer. ...My name is Mia Fey.] in the original release)Melissa: ... ...I see. So you are...Judge: Now then, young lady. Could you please give us your testimony?Melissa: Yes, Your Honor... I-I'll do my best.Witness Testimony-- The Witness's Photograph --Melissa: I... I was using my camera to take some pictures of wild flowers. Then, I noticed there were two people standing up on the suspension bridge. Suddenly, they just started fighting! That's when I hurried and took the photo that shows the crucial moment. And right after that, I called the police.Judge: Hmm... By the way, where were you standing when the incident occurred...?Edgeworth: I believe the map would be of help here.Melissa: Umm... I was standing right over... here. [caption] I was standing to the south of the bridge. I was standing in a beautiful field, surrounded by tall cliffs.Judge: So you took the photo from that location, eh.Melissa: I brought the camera I was using at the time, just like Mr. Edgeworth asked me to.Judge: Ho ho ho. What a cute camera... Just like its owner.Camera added to the Court Record.Judge: ...Alright then, Ms. Fey. Time for your cross-examination. But I warn you, make the witness cry again, and you'll feel the wrath of my gavel.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Witness's Photograph --Melissa: I... I was using my camera to take some pictures of wild flowers.Press Mia: Mia: Did you say... \"wild flowers\"? Melissa: Yes, the mountain is famous for its beautiful spring wild flowers. Mia: Umm... But it's only February. Melissa: Well, I... I couldn't wait for Spring to come. Judge: Ho ho... I know just how you feel! It's just like when I first started growing this glorious beard of mine... I just couldn't wait, so I wore a dyed blonde Santa beard until mine grew in properly. Edgeworth: ...Would you mind if we got back to the facts of the case, Your Honor?Melissa: Then, I noticed there were two people standing up on the suspension bridge.Press Mia: Mia: Was there anything strange about the two of them? Melissa: I... I'm a bad girl. ...I know I am. It looked like they were having a really serious conversation up there... ...So I decided to watch them. Like some kind of Peeping Tom. Judge: No, not at all! Everyone is like that! I love watching other people fight, too. In fact, I can't get enough of it! ...Actually, that's why I took this job in the first place. Mia: (Too much info, Your Honor!) Edgeworth: ...In any case, it's perfectly natural for you to have kept watching them. Especially dressed as they were... Melissa: Well, anyway... I was watching them very closely.Melissa: Suddenly, they just started fighting!Press Mia: Mia: Do you have any idea what they were fighting about? Melissa: Eh? No... I have no idea. Why do you ask that? Mia: Oh, I just thought that maybe you overheard what they said... Melissa: ... Mia: ...! Melissa: I would never... I would never eavesdrop... I've got more class than that! Judge: That's right, Ms. Fey! Don't drag the witness down to your level! Mia: (Grrrr...!)Melissa: That's when I hurried and took the photo that shows the crucial moment.Press Mia: Mia: Why did you take a photo? Melissa: Well, the two of them were really going at it... Ever since I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a news reporter... I guess that part of me just kind of took over... Mia: (Smells like a lie to me...) Judge: Yes, I understand completely! Even now, I can't completely abandon my boyhood dreams... I still use my grandson to test my comedy routines on! Mia: (So he wanted to be a comedian, huh. ...Not that it has any bearing on this.) Melissa: All I could do was to use my camera. So I took the photo of the crucial moment and gave it to the police.Present Witness's Photo Mia: Mia: ...Witness. When you said you took a photo of the crucial moment,  is this what you meant? Melissa: Err... Mia: All I can see in this photo are two people facing each other. You testified that you saw the two of them starting to fight. Normally that's the kind of thing we would refer to as a crucial moment! Why haven't you presented a photo like that!? Melissa: ...W-Well, you see... Edgeworth: ...The photo we presented was the only one there was. Mia: But if you really wanted to capture the crucial moment... ...then what happened next? You must have taken a photo of it! Judge: Hm... Hmmmmm... Doh! Err... Umm... My apologies, young lady... But Ms. Fey's assertion is not without a certain amount of merit... Mia: He can certainly downplay a situation, can't he... (Was an inner monologue in the original release) Melissa: ...I-I'm sorry... ...I'm a very bad girl. I umm... I used it all up... The film, I mean. Judge: You ran out of film!? Melissa: Err, this photo was the last one. Mia: What!? Edgeworth: Unfortunately, that is the truth. ...I personally examined all of the photographs she took that day. All the other photos are of the witness herself, playing among the wild flowers. Mia: The witness herself? Then who took the photos? Melissa: Well... You see... My camera has a timer feature built into it. Mia: So, you took photos of yourself!? Judge: Hmm... I remember taking some photos of myself once, too! Mia: (Please! No details...!) Judge: ...It seems that Ms. Fey's assertion was not so decisive after all. Mia: W-Wait! Just a minute! Judge: Well, if she had no film left, she couldn't very well take more pictures, eh. Edgeworth: Ms. Foster, perhaps then you could tell us about a different sort of photo. Photos of the incident that you \"took\" with your very own eyes. Melissa: Mr. Edgeworth... You're quite the poet! Judge: Very well then! Let's get back to the cross-examination. ...Let's hear your thoughts on the fight that you witnessed! Melissa: Yes... Mr. Judge. Mia: (Boy, this guy is really a sucker for sweet talk...)

Why do you think she tried to run away? Melissa: Umm... Mia: With her police training, she certainly knew better than to turn her back on a criminal... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This was a large, powerful man with a knife. If it had been a quaggy woman like you, I'm sure she would have acted differently. Mia: (\"Quaggy\"!? Why you...!)

Because it looked to me like the murderer was going to try to escape. Edgeworth: ...We were already moving before the call even came in. Thanks to the victim's note, we had already started our operation. Judge: Hmm... That was certainly tough luck for the criminal, eh.Melissa: She only got about 10 yards before she was stabbed in the back.Press Mia: Mia: So you're saying Sergeant Hawthorne wasn't able to get away from him...? Melissa: Well, it's a narrow bridge and it was swaying back and forth... If you ask me, both of them were in danger of falling off. I only wish I could have done something to help her...

Allow me to personally apologize for the confusion.Judge: What do you mean?Edgeworth: There's one major mistake in this diagram.Mia: What did you say!?Judge: What are you referring to?Edgeworth: It's all because this diagram was made after the incident occurred. It's a very old bridge... We couldn't find any official blueprints of it.Judge: S-So you're saying...?Edgeworth: I'm saying that even though this bridge is currently in disrepair... ...there's no evidence that can prove that the bridge was broken during the incident.Mia: Th-That's ridiculous...!Edgeworth: You can't actually tell the condition of the bridge from this photo... I apologize to the court for not being more clear when I presented the evidence.Judge: Hmm. Hmmmm...Armando: Ha...! That guy is good.Mia: Huh? What do you mean?Armando: He planned it from the beginning. He's a genius alright... That diagram of the bridge was his insurance policy.Mia: (What!? That coward!)Judge: Well, Ms. Fey... It seems you've once again made a reckless accusation.Mia: ...!Melissa: I-I'm so sorry! I should have been more careful myself...!Judge: No, no, no, no!

Alright, young lady... May I ask you to please proceed with your testimony?Melissa: But I... It's so hard to go on...!Judge: We're all on your side, Ms. Foster!Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. Just tell us what you saw.Melissa: Y-Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Running From the Crime --Melissa: After he stabbed her in the back, he quickly picked her up in his arms. Then he carried her over to the car. I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden. He couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge. Oh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.Judge: Hmm... Witnessing such violence must have been difficult.Melissa: Yes, sir... I-I'm still shaken up...Armando: If he accepts this testimony as it is, we're finished.Mia: D-Don't say that...!Armando: Oh well... Maybe I'll stop off at my favorite caf\u00e9 on the way home.

Melissa: Err... Umm... Actually, maybe she did fall. Edgeworth: Of course she didn't fall down on the bridge. If she had fallen down, this photo wouldn't make any sense. If that was the case, her coat would've been all muddy. Mia: Mia: If you don't mind, I was asking the witness! Edgeworth: *sigh* No need to be so rude. Judge: Well, young lady? Melissa: ... Of course she didn't fall down. The man in the prison uniform grabbed her before she could. Mia: ... Armando: Ha...! We're one step too slow...

Mia: Did anything strange happen when he did that? Melissa: Well, I don't know if you'd call it strange or not... ...but that's when the victim's scarf fell off. Judge: Hmm... You mean this scarf!? Edgeworth: Her words match what we found at the scene. I don't see any problem...Melissa: I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.Press Mia: Mia: You mean the defendant carried the body all by himself? Melissa: Y-Yes... Edgeworth: Considering the size of the defendant, I don't think it would be difficult. Mia: Yes, but... Let's remember they were on a narrow bridge that was ready to collapse! Is it even possible for him to have carried a dead body on a bridge like that...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, the fact of the matter is that he DID! That kind of talk is just silly! Mia: (Wow... Why did he get so emotional all of a sudden?) Judge: Ms. Fey, if you think there's some other possibility, please share it with the rest of us.Present Dusky Bridge Map Mia: Mia: A killer not wanting his victim to be found... I can understand that. However! The idea of moving the body for that purpose is clearly odd. There was a much easier way to make sure the body wasn't found! Edgeworth: ... Judge: W-Well? What is it!? Mia: Take another look at the map of the area and you'll see how. There's a river right below the bridge. Earlier Mr. Edgeworth pointed out something interesting about the river. Edgeworth: For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered... Judge: Ahh... Mia: In the kidnapping case 5 years ago, the victim's body was carried away and never found. Melissa: ...! Mia: If 10 murders were to occur at that same spot above the Eagle River... ...you can bet your boots that every other killer would have tossed the body in the water! Judge: Order! Order! Order! I'm not sure if I care for the way you put that, Ms. Fey! But I must admit it does seem odd not to have thrown the body into the river! Melissa: Ooooh...! Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: *sigh* How sad. Perhaps Ms. Fey would do well to try taking a dip in the river herself. After all, you claim to be such an expert in the ways of nature... Mia: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: My point is that no matter how odd you may find the killer's method of body-disposal... ...the fact is that this is what the killer did. None of your arguments have anything to do with what the witness saw. Judge: Hmm... Quite true... Ms. Fey, it seems that your assertion is without merit after all. Mia: Mia: But what the witness claims to have seen is totally ridiculous... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Surely you can't deny that the body was found in the trunk of the car. Judge: That's certainly consistent with what the witness has told us. Mia: Ugh... Edgeworth: Please, witness, go on with your testimony. Melissa: I-I'll try... Edgeworth: All you have to do is tell us only what you saw. Otherwise the mean lady might yell at you again. Mia: (Who is he talking about!?) Melissa: Alright! I-I'll do my best!

Melissa: Well... Naturally, he got in the car and was about to flee. That's... That's when I came to my senses. I said to myself, \"You have to call the police!\" Edgeworth: And so that's when you called the police? Mia: You're sure that you saw all that with your own eyes? Melissa: Yes. I'm 100% certain.Present Dusky Bridge Map or Witness's Photo Mia: Leads to: \"Well, Ms. Foster... It looks like you've done it this time.\"Melissa: He couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge.Press Mia: Mia: Why do you say that? It's already a broken-down bridge hidden away in the mountains. Doing anything more to hide the corpse would be going overboard, wouldn't it? Melissa: Yes, but that mountain is famous among hikers. A surprising number of people go up there. Mia: But it's February, right? And it was raining that day, correct? Melissa: There is also a small temple and a channeling dojo there. You know those monks... They just love cold, isolated places... Edgeworth: I think the witness is trying to say that the corpse could have been found at any time... Besides, the witness is merely reporting what she witnessed with her own eyes. Melissa: ...Melissa: Oh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.Press Mia: Mia: And you're absolutely certain that it was my client who was carrying the body? Melissa: ... Well, he was wearing a prisoner's uniform, but... as for his face... Judge: So you're saying you didn't get a clear look at his face? Melissa: Well, they were far away and it was raining as well. I-I thought I was only supposed to say exactly what I saw... Judge: Excellent! You're a remarkably honest young woman!Mia: (Something about this testimony is bothering me, but what...?)Armando: Hey, Kitten... Have you ever put salt in your coffee?Mia: No... Why would I!?Armando: Why not?Mia: Huh...?Armando: It may actually go better with coffee than sugar, right?Mia: ...Armando: Listen. My point is if you're not sure, you might as well add a ton of salt to it. It might... bring out the rust in something. Like a piece of evidence.Mia: (He's right, Mia... Go present something. You've got nothing to lose!)Armando: By the way, I wouldn't put salt in my coffee. The two don't go well, after all.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Terry Fawles\nDescription: My client.

    "cot": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find which evidence and testimony from the given list contradict each other. Let me start by going through the evidence and testimonies to see where the inconsistency lies.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies provided by Melissa Foster. She's the college student who witnessed the crime. Her testimonies include statements about how the killer (supposedly Terry Fawles) handled the body after stabbing Valerie Hawthorne. Specifically, Testimony 3 says, \"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\" \n\nNow, looking at the evidence, Evidence 4 is the Crime Photo of the trunk. The description mentions that the trunk opener appears to be tampered with. Wait, but if the killer broke into the trunk, that would mean the trunk was forced open. However, the Crime Photo's caption says the trunk opener was tampered, which suggests someone tried to open it without breaking in, maybe using a key or some other method. But according to Melissa's testimony, the killer broke into the trunk. That could be a contradiction. If the trunk was already tampered with (maybe unlocked or opened without force), then breaking into it wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, if the trunk was forced open (broken into), the evidence should show signs of forced entry, but the description says \"tampered\" which might not necessarily mean broken. However, in the context of the game, tampered could imply forced entry. Hmm, maybe I need to cross-reference this with the map.\n\nWait, Evidence 2 is the Dusky Bridge Map. It shows that the bridge is broken on the east side and connects to a parking lot on the west. The Crime Photo's trunk is part of the stolen car, which would be in the parking lot. But how does that relate to breaking into the trunk? Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nAnother angle: The victim's coat in the Crime Photo (Evidence 4) is dry and clean. Earlier testimonies mentioned that the bridge was wet and muddy. If the victim was carried and the body was moved, her coat should be dirty, but it's clean. That was addressed earlier in the trial. But Melissa's testimony here is about moving the body to the trunk, not about the coat's condition. \n\nWait, the key contradiction here is in Testimony 3: \"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\" But Evidence 4's Crime Photo states the trunk opener was \"tampered.\" If the trunk was already open or tampered with without force, then the act of breaking into it would be unnecessary. However, \"tampered\" could mean forced entry, so maybe this isn't the contradiction. Let me check other evidence.\n\nLooking at Evidence 3, the Victim's Note, which mentions the white scarf. The Scarf (Evidence 5) is blue and muddy. But that's not directly related to the testimony about the trunk.\n\nWait, another possibility: The map (Evidence 2) shows that the bridge is broken on the east side. If the killer was on the bridge and carried the body to the car parked on the west side (parking lot), then Melissa's testimony about the killer moving the body from the bridge to the car's trunk would be possible. But maybe the location of the car is an issue. However, the stolen car was taken from a couple at a red light, so it's plausible it was driven to the bridge's parking lot.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Witness's Photo (Evidence 6), which shows the victim standing near the broken end of the bridge. If the bridge was broken, how did the killer carry the body across? But the map says the bridge is broken on the east side, while the parking lot is on the west. So the killer would have to go west towards the parking lot, which is accessible. So that's not the contradiction.\n\nWait, Melissa's Testimony 3 says the killer broke into the trunk. But the car was stolen. The stolen car's trunk might not have been locked, or the keys were available. If Fawles stole the car, he might have had the keys, so breaking into the trunk wouldn't be necessary. Therefore, if the trunk was opened normally with keys, but the testimony says he broke into it, that's a contradiction. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 4) says the trunk opener was tampered, which could mean forced entry (breaking in). So maybe they align. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think again. The stolen car's trunk: if Terry stole the car, he might not have the keys to the trunk. So he would have to break into it. But the Crime Photo's caption says the trunk opener was tampered with, which would support that. So maybe no contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle. The testimony says the killer broke into the trunk, but according to the evidence, the body was placed in the trunk. If the trunk was already open, then breaking into it wouldn't be necessary. But the evidence says the trunk opener was tampered, which implies forced entry. So maybe the testimony and evidence are consistent. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check the other testimonies. Testimony 4 says \"He couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge.\" But the bridge is broken, so maybe leaving the body there wouldn't hide it. But the map shows the bridge is over a river with strong currents. If the body was thrown into the river, it would be carried away. But the killer didn't do that. The defense earlier pointed out that not throwing the body into the river is odd, but the prosecution dismissed it as irrelevant. However, that's not a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, another thought. The Witness's Photo (Evidence 6) shows the victim wearing a scarf and a hat. The scarf in Evidence 5 is blue and muddy. But the Victim's Note (Evidence 3) says to wear a white scarf for identification. The scarf found is blue, not white. That's a contradiction. But which testimony does that contradict? The Victim's Note's instruction was to wear a white scarf, but the scarf found is blue. That could imply that the victim wasn't Valerie, but someone else. However, the autopsy confirms it's Valerie. So maybe the scarf was changed, but the testimony from Melissa says the victim was wearing a scarf, which in the photo is the same as the blue one found. That suggests that the caller (supposedly Fawles) told her to wear white, but she wore blue. Which could indicate that Valerie wasn't the intended victim, but that's a different contradiction. However, this relates to the Victim's Note and the Scarf evidence, not directly to Melissa's testimonies about the trunk.\n\nWait, the main contradiction earlier in the trial was about the coat not being muddy despite the rain. That was resolved with the Scarf's muddiness proving the bridge was muddy. But that's already been addressed.\n\nGoing back to the current task: the user is asking which evidence and testimony (from the given lists) contradict each other. The options are the provided evidences 0-8 and testimonies 0-5. The answer must be in the JSON format.\n\nLooking at Melissa's Testimony 3: \"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\" The corresponding evidence would be the Crime Photo (Evidence 4), which says the trunk opener was tampered. If \"broke into\" implies forced entry, and \"tampered\" also implies forced entry, they might align. But perhaps there's a contradiction in the method. Alternatively, maybe the car was already stolen, and breaking into the trunk wasn't necessary if the keys were present. But if the car was stolen, the keys might not be available, so breaking in would be necessary. Hmm.\n\nWait, another angle: The Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the victim's coat is dry and clean. If the killer carried her through the muddy bridge (as per the Scarf evidence), her coat should be muddy. But the coat is clean, which contradicts the act of carrying her on the bridge. But that contradiction was already addressed earlier in the trial when Mia presented the Scarf. The current testimonies are about moving the body to the trunk, not about the coat's condition. So that's a different point.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Dusky Bridge Map (Evidence 2), which shows the bridge is broken on the east side. Melissa's testimony says the killer carried the body from the bridge to the car in the parking lot (west side). But if the bridge is broken, how did he get to the west side? Wait, the map's caption says the bridge connects to the parking lot towards the west. The broken part is on the east side. So if the meeting happened on the west side near the parking lot, then carrying the body to the car makes sense. So no contradiction there.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (\"broke into the trunk\") and the Crime Photo's description that the trunk opener was tampered. If \"tampered\" means that the trunk was opened without force (e.g., with a tool or key), but the testimony says \"broke into,\" which implies forced entry, maybe that's a contradiction. However, \"tampered\" can mean forced entry. So maybe they are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 2: \"I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.\" But the Dusky Bridge Map shows the river below, which would have been a better way to hide the body, as previously argued. But that's a logical inconsistency, not a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, perhaps the key contradiction is between the Witness's Photo (Evidence 6) and Melissa's testimony. The photo shows the victim standing near the broken end of the bridge. If the bridge was broken, how could the killer carry her to the car? But the map indicates the parking lot is on the west, accessible part of the bridge. So if the victim was on the west side, near the parking lot, carrying her to the car is feasible. So no contradiction here.\n\nWait, another thought. Melissa's Testimony 3 says the killer broke into the trunk. But the car was stolen, so maybe the trunk was already open or accessible. If the car was stolen, the keys might have been with the owner, so Terry wouldn't have them, necessitating breaking into the trunk. The Crime Photo's trunk being tampered supports that. So they align. Not a contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the other testimonies. Testimony 0: \"After he stabbed her in the back, he quickly picked her up in his arms.\" The autopsy report (Evidence 1) says the cause of death was blood loss from a stab wound. If she was stabbed and immediately picked up, there would be blood on the killer's clothes, but there's no mention of blood on Terry's clothes. However, the evidence doesn't mention that, so it's not a direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the Witness's Photo (Evidence 6) shows the victim wearing a scarf and hat. The Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the body without a scarf. The Scarf (Evidence 5) was found on the bridge. So the testimony about the scarf falling off during the struggle aligns with the evidence. No contradiction here.\n\nWait, the main contradiction earlier was the clean coat vs. the muddy scarf, which was resolved by the Scarf's muddiness. But that's already addressed.\n\nWait, going back to the current cross-examination part in the transcript, when Mia presents the Dusky Bridge Map against Melissa's testimony about the victim running 10 yards. The map shows the bridge is broken, so she couldn't have run that far. However, Edgeworth counters that the map's condition during the incident isn't proven. So that's a possible contradiction, but the evidence here is the map (Evidence 2) and the testimony is about the running distance. However, in the current testimonies provided, Melissa's Testimony 4 is about not leaving the body on the bridge, not the running distance. The running distance contradiction was in an earlier testimony, not in the current set provided here.\n\nThe user provided the current testimonies as:\n\nTestimony 0: After he stabbed her in the back, he quickly picked her up in his arms.\n\nTestimony 1: Then he carried her over to the car.\n\nTestimony 2: I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.\n\nTestimony 3: The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\n\nTestimony 4: He couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge.\n\nTestimony 5: Oh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.\n\nThe evidence includes the Crime Photo (4) with the trunk tampered, and the Dusky Bridge Map (2) showing the bridge's structure.\n\nThe contradiction that Mia pointed out earlier was about the bridge's condition, but Edgeworth dismissed it by saying the map's condition during the incident isn't certain. However, in the current testimonies, the key contradiction is likely between the act of breaking into the trunk (Testimony 3) and the Crime Photo's tampered trunk. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is that the car was stolen, so the killer wouldn't need to break into the trunk if he had the keys. But the Crime Photo says the trunk opener was tampered, implying forced entry, which aligns with Testimony 3. So maybe they are consistent.\n\nWait, another angle. The Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the victim's body in the trunk. The description says the trunk opener was tampered. However, if the killer had just stolen the car, he might not have the keys to the trunk, hence needing to break in. The tampered opener supports that. So Testimony 3 and Evidence 4 are consistent. No contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is different. Let's look at the Witness's Photo (Evidence 6), which shows the victim standing near the broken end of the bridge. If the bridge was broken, the killer couldn't have approached from that side. But the testimony says he carried her to the car on the west side. The map shows the west side is connected to the parking lot. So if the meeting was on the west side, near the parking lot, then carrying her to the car makes sense. No contradiction here.\n\nWait, another thought. The Victim's Note (Evidence 3) says \"Wear white scarf for identification,\" but the Scarf (Evidence 5) is blue. That's a contradiction, implying that the victim wasn't Valerie, but that's a different point. However, the testimonies don't mention the scarf color. So this isn't directly conflicting with any of Melissa's testimonies here.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (\"broke into the trunk\") and the fact that the car was stolen. If the car was stolen, the keys might have been in the ignition, allowing access to the trunk without breaking in. Therefore, the trunk wouldn't need to be broken into, but the evidence shows it was tampered. However, if the keys weren't available, breaking in makes sense. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Car's Trunk: If the killer placed the body in the trunk, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the victim's coat is clean, which contradicts the fact that the scarf was muddy. But this was already addressed earlier, and the contradiction there was between the coat and the scarf, not the trunk.\n\nAt this point, I might be overcomplicating. Let's refer back to the game's actual contradiction. In the game, Mia points out that the witness's testimony about the victim running 10 yards is impossible due to the broken bridge. This is tied to the Dusky Bridge Map (Evidence 2) and Testimony regarding the distance. However, in the provided testimonies, this specific testimony isn't listed here. The current testimonies are about moving the body to the trunk.\n\nWait, looking back at the transcript provided, during the cross-examination of Melissa's testimony about the victim running, Mia presents the Dusky Bridge Map to show the contradiction. The testimony at that point was that the victim ran 10 yards, but the bridge was broken, making that impossible. The map (Evidence 2) contradicts that testimony. However, in the provided testimonies for this question, that specific testimony isn't listed. The current testimonies provided are from the later part of the trial, after that contradiction was addressed.\n\nWait, the user has provided a subset of the testimonies for this question. The testimonies in the current cross-examination are:\n\n-- Running From the Crime --\nMelissa's testimonies after the initial contradictions:\n\n1. After he stabbed her in the back, he quickly picked her up in his arms.\n2. Then he carried her over to the car.\n3. I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.\n4. The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\n5. He couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge.\n6. Oh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.\n\nBut according to the JSON data provided by the user, the Testimonies are numbered 0-5:\n\nTestimony 0: After he stabbed her in the back, he quickly picked her up in his arms.\n\nTestimony 1: Then he carried her over to the car.\n\nTestimony 2: I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.\n\nTestimony 3: The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\n\nTestimony 4: He couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge.\n\nTestimony 5: Oh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.\n\nThe key contradiction here is when Mia presents the Dusky Bridge Map (Evidence 2) against Melissa's Testimony about hiding the body in the trunk. Specifically, Melissa's Testimony 3 says the killer broke into the trunk, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the trunk opener was tampered, which could align. However, another angle: the Dusky Bridge Map shows the parking lot is on the west side, and the bridge is broken on the east. If the killer carried the body from the bridge to the car in the parking lot (west), that's feasible. But if the car was parked on the west side, and the meeting happened there, then the killer wouldn't need to carry the body far. However, the contradiction might be elsewhere.\n\nWait, in the game, after presenting the map, Mia argues that the witness couldn't have seen the events because the view from the south (where Melissa was) to the parking lot (west) is obstructed by huge rocks, as per the map's caption. Therefore, Melissa couldn't have seen the killer putting the body into the trunk if she was south of the bridge. The map (Evidence 2) states that the view from the south to the parking lot is blocked by rocks. So if Melissa was south of the bridge, she couldn't see the parking lot where the car was. Therefore, her testimony about seeing the killer put the body into the trunk is impossible because her view was blocked. \n\nThat's the actual contradiction in the game. Therefore, the evidence is the Dusky Bridge Map (2) and the testimony is Testimony 3 about breaking into the trunk. Because the map's description says the view from the south to the parking lot is obstructed, Melissa, who was south of the bridge, couldn't have seen the killer placing the body into the car's trunk in the parking lot. Therefore, her testimony about witnessing that action is contradicted by the map's evidence.\n\nSo the JSON answer should be {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}."

How nostalgic.Gumshoe: And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir.Press Mia: Mia: Was the body of the victim discovered right away? Gumshoe: Yeah. We were really on the ball. We found the criminal within one hour of the murder. It was great! We even got to say, \"Don't move! We've got you surrounded!\" Mia: (...Wait a second. Isn't there something weird about that...?) Armando: The location was a suspension bridge, up in the mountains. So how did they find out about the crime so quickly...? Mia: Sergeant Hawthorne must have mentioned the phone call to someone else, right? Armando: Ha...! If that's what had happened, then she wouldn't have been killed. Gumshoe: She never mentioned the phone call from Mr. Fawles. But... She left a note on her desk about it. If only I had noticed it earlier... Maybe she'd still be alive.

Gumshoe: No, no, of course not. ...It was stolen. He stole it from a young couple that had been waiting at a red light. Judge: Hmm... Car thieves... I'm not sure how I feel about car thieves.

The defendant...! The defendant called her!? Gumshoe: Sergeant Hawthorne was a very thorough person, sir! She left a note about her phone call with Mr. Fawles. Mia: A note...? Gumshoe: Yeah, a top-secret memo that she left on her desk. Victim's Note added to the Court Record. Judge: Hmm... According to this note, it seems the one who called her to the bridge was indeed... ...the defendant, Terry Fawles! Mia: Nngh! (Whose bright idea was it to keep that note from me!?) Armando: Ha...! Looks like the judge is even more sure of his verdict now. Listen up! Never ask a question if you don't already know the answer! Mia: (It's that detective's fault!

Come on, Mia! Shake it off! You're a lawyer!) Detective!Gumshoe: Y-Yes, ma'am!Mia: This photo... You said that there was nothing peculiar about it. ...Is that correct?Gumshoe: Y-Yeah, that's what I said!Mia: Well then, I suggest you take another look at the note written by the victim!Gumshoe: The n-n-note...?Mia: It very clearly says, \"Wear white scarf for identification.\"... The caller must have forgotten what the victim looked like. Thus, this special request.Gumshoe: Aaah... I, umm...!Mia: I have one very simple question for you, Detective. Where is the white scarf? I can't seem to find it in this photo...Gumshoe: Um... Well, to be honest, we didn't find it in the trunk, ma'am...Mia: And you stopped there!? You should have looked for it!Gumshoe: Aaaaaaarrrggg...!Judge: The caller told her to wear it to identify herself, so I'd expect she did just that! Well, Mr. Edgeworth!? What do you have to say about this!?Edgeworth: *sigh* I see the defense is a little... lacking.Mia: ...!Edgeworth: The scarf you are searching so desperately for... ...Is it this one, perchance?Mia: ...Ah!Gumshoe: Wh-Where did you find that, sir!?Edgeworth: On Dusky Bridge. I was there first, and decided to conduct my own investigation.Gumshoe: Wh-Why...? Why didn't you tell me?Edgeworth: I made a decision to keep all pieces of evidence in my personal satchel. It's the safest place I know.Armando: Hmph! That hot-shot sure has a flair for the dramatic...Edgeworth: It's not exactly \"white\", as the caller requested... But as you can see, it's close enough, for what it was intended for.Judge: Hmmm... It looks like it spent some time in the mud.Edgeworth: Not surprising... It was drizzling on the mountain that day.Mia: (Prosecutor Edgeworth... He was intentionally hiding that scarf the whole time!)Judge: The court will accept the scarf into evidence.Scarf added to the Court Record.Edgeworth: Now, if the attorney for the defense is finished embarrassing herself... ...I'd like to move on with the testimony. That IS alright with you, isn't it, Ms. Fey?Mia: (Boy would I like to wrap this scarf around his smarmy little neck...)Edgeworth: Very good. Now, if we're done with this mud-covered scarf business... ...the prosecution moves to establish conclusively, and with hard evidence that... ...Ms. Hawthorne and Mr. Fawles did indeed meet on that bridge that day. Further, we will show exactly what occurred there.Judge: That sounds quite promising. I can't wait to hear all about it.Mia: (Argh... Everything is moving at his whim...)Armando: Don't forget, Kitten. There's a reason why everyone considers this kid a genius.Mia: (A genius, huh...)Witness Testimony-- Events on Dusky Bridge --Gumshoe: Actually, there's an eyewitness who was there when the incident took place. This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows the vic wearing the scarf, sir. (Changed from [This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows her wearing the scarf, sir.] in the original release) It was drizzling that day; unfortunately, it's a little hard to see what's going on. Anyway, the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back! ...That must have been when the scarf fell off.Judge: Hmm. Looking at this photo... ...you really get the sense that this bridge is very high up.Edgeworth: It is about a 40 feet drop from the bridge to the Eagle River down below.Judge: Mr. Edgeworth, who took this photo anyway?Edgeworth: Let's just say that it was a well-intentioned third party.Judge: Aha! A potential witness! So why isn't this person in the courtroom?Gumshoe: Well... They said they absolutely did not want to testify.Edgeworth: ...The person in question is very delicate, Your Honor. Besides, as long as we have this photo, we see no reason to compel her to testify.Judge: ... I'm not sure how I feel about that!Witness's Photo added to the Court Record.Edgeworth: So, as you can see, Terry Fawles had both the motive and the opportunity. I think it's quite clear at this point what happened on that bridge.Judge: ... Hmm. Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!Mia: Huh?Judge: Yes, it's quite obvious. He's clearly guilty.Mia: N-Not again! That's not fair! I haven't even done my cross-examination yet!Judge: Hmm...Mia: (What do you mean, \"Hmm\"!?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Events on Dusky Bridge --Gumshoe: Actually, there's an eyewitness who was there when the incident took place.Press Mia: Mia: Who is this eyewitness? Gumshoe: She's a college student! Mia: A female college student...? Gumshoe: That's right! Meaning she's \"female\" AND a \"college student\", ma'am!

So, about the witness who took this photo... What was this person doing all the way in the mountains? Gumshoe: She was taking photos of wild flowers apparently. Edgeworth: There are many unusual types of flora on that mountain, Ms. Fey. People in the area say it's because of the spirits that live there. Judge: S-S-Spirits! Now that you mention it, th-this photo... This cloudy fog-like thing... Is-Is it a ghost!? I-I don't believe it! Gumshoe: No, Your Honor, no... I don't think it's a ghost.Gumshoe: It was drizzling that day; unfortunately, it's a little hard to see what's going on.Press Mia: Mia: Drizzling, huh? Gumshoe: That's right. There was a light rain coming down. The whole place was dreary... ...But not as dreary as the mood that's in this court room right now. Ha ha. Mia: ... Edgeworth: ... Judge: ... Gumshoe: ...Looks like a cold front just moved in. Edgeworth: In any case... The point is that the area was quite damp. There was even some fog.

It was really something.Gumshoe: Anyway, the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back!Press Mia: Mia: Is that part of the witness's testimony as well?

Leads back to: \"What is it about this photo of the trunk that doesn't fit with the conditions that day?\"Mia: Naturally the answer is... right here!Judge: The victim's... coat? As far as I can see, there is nothing strange about it.Mia: That's exactly what's strange! Remember the testimony! What were the conditions on the bridge that day? It was drizzling and foggy. Dusky Bridge was all wet. If the victim really had fallen down on her stomach on top of the bridge... ...then the front of her coat should have been covered in mud!Gumshoe: Urk...!Edgeworth: ...!Judge: That... That's exactly right! The other day I fell on a muddy street and my gorgeous playoff beard was befouled!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: ...I do admit that the crime scene was quite wet that day. However! That doesn't mean that the top of the bridge itself was muddy! If Your Honor had fallen in the shower instead of on a muddy street... ...his glorious hockey beard, pride of the Legal League, would be wet, but not muddy!Judge: Fortunately, I have yet to test that. Still, your point is well-taken.Edgeworth: Can you prove that the surface of the bridge was muddy that day?Mia: (The surface of the bridge, huh...)Armando: Ha...! A real man wouldn't stand for a taunt like this!Mia: (Neither would a real woman!) Of course I can!Edgeworth: ...!Mia: Here is the evidence that proves the surface of the bridge was muddy!Present Scarf Mia: Leads to: \"The evidence is... this scarf!\"Present anything else Mia: Mia: The evidence is... Armando: Wait a minute. Mia: Wh-What is it? Your timing is terrible...! Armando: If you present that evidence, it would be like... Like jumping off a 100-story building into a bubbling pool of magma. ...After tying a 10-ton boulder around your neck. Mia: What is THAT supposed to mean? Armando: To put it simply... It would be suicide. Mia: (Why didn't he just put it simply in the first place...?) Edgeworth: Is your little chat finished? Can we move on now? Mia: Y-Yes... I-I've changed my mind. Judge: Life is short, Ms. Fey. Hurry it up already! Mia: Yes, Your Honor! The defense is now prepared to show our evidence! Leads back to: \"Here is the evidence that proves the surface of the bridge was muddy!\"Mia: The evidence is... this scarf!Judge: Ah...!Mia: It should be obvious... If the scarf fell onto the bridge and got this muddy... It means that the bridge was obviously covered in mud!Edgeworth: Urrrnngh...! No... I can't be outwitted by this novice bimbo...!Mia: (Hey! Same to you, buddy!)Judge: Ms. Fey's assertion makes perfect sense to me...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I do admit that there appears to be a contradiction between... ...the condition of the victim's coat and her scarf. However! The real question is... why is there a contradiction?Mia: Huh?Edgeworth: For every contradiction, there exists an explanation. Let's look at what the explanation in this case may be, shall we?Mia: A-Alright...! (It's not like he's really giving me a choice here...)Armando: Ha...! You're doing pretty well. ...For a little kitten. (Changed from [You're doing pretty good. ...For a little kitten.] in the original release)Mia: M-Mr. Armando!Armando: No matter what he says, a contradiction always comes down to a lie. It's either the victim discovered in the trunk... ...the witness's photo showing the defendant and the victim... ...or the witness's testimony that stated she saw the moment of the murder. Just relax and think it over. It's pretty simple, isn't it? The false evidence... It's one of those three.Judge: Hmph! What you said just now! I'm not sure I like that!Mia: Th-That wasn't me, Your Honor! It was the coffee aficionado over here that said it!Judge: This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!Armando: Blame it on him, Your Honor. He's the one trying to slip false evidence into the court.Mia: ...!Armando: But we won't let him! We'll expose his evidence as the flimsy scam it really is!Mia: Y-Yes! The false evidence in this case is the...witness's photo. Mia: About the photo that the prosecution claims was taken by a witness... It certainly seems to show a man in a prison uniform and a woman in a coat. However! We can't tell any more than that from the photo! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you saying the people in the photo may not be the victim and the defendant? Mia: W-Well, that's certainly a possibility! Edgeworth: So perhaps it was another prisoner and policewoman? I admit, people have their quirks. Perhaps they were part of a role-playing group? Mia: W-Well, I suppose that's also p-possible... I guess... Armando: You messed up again... Kitten. Mia: M-Mr. Armando! Armando: There should be something else that's even more suspicious. Now think the whole thing over again. Judge: From this point on, Ms. Fey, I will penalize you for making unsubstantiated accusations! Mia: (Ugggh... Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry until you get home!) Judge: In any case...! Leads back to: \"This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!\"body in the trunk Mia: If the victim really did try to repel her killer and if she did fall down on the bridge... ...then you would expect her coat to be dirty. Therefore! The body that was found in the trunk of the car... It was NOT the body of Valerie Hawthorne! Judge: Wh-What do you have to say to that, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: *sigh* Objection. Judge: Hmm... Not only a whisper, but he mixed in a sigh, too. Edgeworth: Valerie Hawthorne was more than a simple meter maid; she was a sergeant. There's absolutely no chance that a mistake about her identity could be made. Mia: Uuurgh... (I guess he's right...) Judge: From this point on, Ms. Fey, I will penalize you for making unsubstantiated accusations! Mia: (Ugggh... Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry until you get home!) Judge: In any case...! Leads back to: \"This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!\"witness's testimony. Leads to: \"It is a no-brainer. Obviously it's the witness that's suspicious!\"Mia: It is a no-brainer. Obviously it's the witness that's suspicious! During his earlier testimony, the detective pointed out a crucial fact. \"The criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back.\" Now, is that testimony exactly what the witness claims to have seen?Gumshoe: Yeah. ...That's what the witness told us.Mia: That testimony... is filled with holes. After all, the victim's coat isn't dirty at all.Judge: Hmm... That's true.Armando: Ha...! It's not just true. It's the truth. If there was a truly decisive witness in this case... ...I'm certain that boy wonder over there would have called them in the first place!Mia: ...Your Honor! The defense requests to cross-examine the eyewitness! The testimony presented so far is not only vague, but contradictory as well!Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth? It appears that we'll need to hear from your mystery witness after all.Edgeworth: ... *sigh* You should brace yourself. ...For the brutal truth.Mia: ...?Edgeworth: Your Honor, the prosecution has no intention of hiding the witness from the court. We are prepared to present our witness at any time.Judge: Very well... Please bring forth your witness at this time.Mia: (What Mr. Edgeworth said... kind of worries me... What does he mean by \"the brutal truth\"?)Judge: Now, let's proceed with the testimony. Mr. Edgeworth. Please go right ahead.Edgeworth: Thank you, Your Honor. The prosecution summons... ...the woman who saw the events that day with her very own eyes.Mia: (This is it, Mia! The battle begins here!)Edgeworth: ...Witness. What is your name and occupation? ...Judge: ...Mia: (Everyone is so silent that I can hear their hearts going pitter-patter...)Judge: Hmm... Ohh... When I look at you... How can I put it...? You look as scrumptous [sic] as a double-double and a dozen doughnut holes... I feel like I want to hurry up and hand down a verdict just to have a bite...Mia: (Hey, hey! Not so fast!)Edgeworth: ...*sigh* As I said before... This witness is very sensitive and delicate. I would ask the court to please exercise care when addressing her.Judge: Yes, indeed... Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. You are a true gentleman. Ms. Fey! You could learn a lot from this man!Mia: (...If he's such a gentleman, he sure doesn't act like one to me.)???: Umm... Sir?Judge: Hmmm... Eh? Yes, my dear????: This is my first time, so I'm sure I'll make a lot of mistakes. Anyway... I just wanted to say I'm sorry for all the trouble I might cause...Judge: Hmmmmm... Not at all! It's no trouble at all!Mia: Now then... May we please have your name and occupation?Melissa: My name is, umm... ...Melissa Foster. I'm a college student... A-A freshman in the literature department.Edgeworth: You were on the scene when the unfortunate event occurred, correct?Mia: ...And you were the one who took this photo? Is that accurate?Melissa: Waaaaaah! H-How can you be so mean...?Judge: Now see here! What are you doing shoving that in her face like that!?Mia: Huh? B-But it's just a photograph! It's not like it's something dangerous!Judge: Next time I'll be forced to penalize you!Mia: (Uh oh... I don't like the turn this has taken...)Melissa: ...Mia: ...? (Is she... staring at me?)Melissa: Umm... And you would be...?Mia: Huh? I-I'm the defense attorney. ...My name is Mia Fey. (Changed form [Huh? I-I'm the defense lawyer. ...My name is Mia Fey.] in the original release)Melissa: ... ...I see. So you are...Judge: Now then, young lady. Could you please give us your testimony?Melissa: Yes, Your Honor... I-I'll do my best.Witness Testimony-- The Witness's Photograph --Melissa: I... I was using my camera to take some pictures of wild flowers. Then, I noticed there were two people standing up on the suspension bridge. Suddenly, they just started fighting! That's when I hurried and took the photo that shows the crucial moment. And right after that, I called the police.Judge: Hmm... By the way, where were you standing when the incident occurred...?Edgeworth: I believe the map would be of help here.Melissa: Umm... I was standing right over... here. [caption] I was standing to the south of the bridge. I was standing in a beautiful field, surrounded by tall cliffs.Judge: So you took the photo from that location, eh.Melissa: I brought the camera I was using at the time, just like Mr. Edgeworth asked me to.Judge: Ho ho ho. What a cute camera... Just like its owner.Camera added to the Court Record.Judge: ...Alright then, Ms. Fey. Time for your cross-examination.

I just couldn't wait, so I wore a dyed blonde Santa beard until mine grew in properly. Edgeworth: ...Would you mind if we got back to the facts of the case, Your Honor?Melissa: Then, I noticed there were two people standing up on the suspension bridge.Press Mia: Mia: Was there anything strange about the two of them?

Ever since I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a news reporter... I guess that part of me just kind of took over... Mia: (Smells like a lie to me...) Judge: Yes, I understand completely! Even now, I can't completely abandon my boyhood dreams... I still use my grandson to test my comedy routines on! Mia: (So he wanted to be a comedian, huh. ...Not that it has any bearing on this.)

When you said you took a photo of the crucial moment,  is this what you meant? Melissa: Err... Mia: All I can see in this photo are two people facing each other. You testified that you saw the two of them starting to fight. Normally that's the kind of thing we would refer to as a crucial moment! Why haven't you presented a photo like that!? Melissa: ...W-Well, you see... Edgeworth: ...The photo we presented was the only one there was. Mia: But if you really wanted to capture the crucial moment... ...then what happened next?

I remember taking some photos of myself once, too! Mia: (Please! No details...!) Judge: ...It seems that Ms. Fey's assertion was not so decisive after all. Mia: W-Wait! Just a minute! Judge: Well, if she had no film left, she couldn't very well take more pictures, eh. Edgeworth: Ms. Foster, perhaps then you could tell us about a different sort of photo. Photos of the incident that you \"took\" with your very own eyes. Melissa: Mr. Edgeworth... You're quite the poet! Judge: Very well then!

Why do you think she tried to run away? Melissa: Umm... Mia: With her police training, she certainly knew better than to turn her back on a criminal... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This was a large, powerful man with a knife. If it had been a quaggy woman like you, I'm sure she would have acted differently. Mia: (\"Quaggy\"!? Why you...!)

Melissa: Well, it's a narrow bridge and it was swaying back and forth... If you ask me, both of them were in danger of falling off. I only wish I could have done something to help her...

There's no possible excuse!Judge: You say there were... two contradictions!?Mia: It's simple. Just take a look at the diagram of the area.

Well, then...Judge: S-She would've hit a dead-end...!Mia: You said 10 yards, but she couldn't have ran even 5! Because Dusky Bridge is collapsed on that side!Melissa: Waaaaaah!Judge: Wh-What does all this mean!?Mia: It's very simple, Your Honor. This charming, little witness told a charming, little lie.

Allow me to personally apologize for the confusion.Judge: What do you mean?Edgeworth: There's one major mistake in this diagram.Mia: What did you say!?Judge: What are you referring to?Edgeworth: It's all because this diagram was made after the incident occurred. It's a very old bridge... We couldn't find any official blueprints of it.Judge: S-So you're saying...?Edgeworth: I'm saying that even though this bridge is currently in disrepair... ...there's no evidence that can prove that the bridge was broken during the incident.Mia: Th-That's ridiculous...!Edgeworth: You can't actually tell the condition of the bridge from this photo... I apologize to the court for not being more clear when I presented the evidence.Judge: Hmm. Hmmmm...Armando: Ha...! That guy is good.Mia: Huh? What do you mean?Armando: He planned it from the beginning. He's a genius alright... That diagram of the bridge was his insurance policy.Mia: (What!? That coward!)Judge: Well, Ms. Fey... It seems you've once again made a reckless accusation.Mia: ...!Melissa: I-I'm so sorry! I should have been more careful myself...!Judge: No, no, no, no! It wasn't YOUR fault at all!Edgeworth: Now then... Shall we go on with the trial? I'd like to establish, once and for all, what it was that the witness actually saw.Judge: Indeed. Alright, young lady... May I ask you to please proceed with your testimony?Melissa: But I... It's so hard to go on...!Judge: We're all on your side, Ms. Foster!Edgeworth: There's no need to worry. Just tell us what you saw.Melissa: Y-Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Running From the Crime --Melissa: After he stabbed her in the back, he quickly picked her up in his arms. Then he carried her over to the car. I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden. He couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge. Oh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.Judge: Hmm... Witnessing such violence must have been difficult.Melissa: Yes, sir... I-I'm still shaken up...Armando: If he accepts this testimony as it is, we're finished.Mia: D-Don't say that...!Armando: Oh well... Maybe I'll stop off at my favorite caf\u00e9 on the way home. They make a really great mocha latt\u00e9...Mia: This trial isn't over yet!Armando: Ha...! That's what I like to hear...Judge: Alright, Ms. Fey. Your cross-examination, if you please.Mia: (The contradiction is staring you right in the face, Mia! Go on the attack!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Running From the Crime --Melissa: After he stabbed her in the back, he quickly picked her up in his arms.Press Mia: Mia: Are you saying that the victim didn't fall down on the bridge? Melissa: Err... Umm... Actually, maybe she did fall. Edgeworth: Of course she didn't fall down on the bridge. If she had fallen down, this photo wouldn't make any sense. If that was the case, her coat would've been all muddy. Mia: Mia: If you don't mind, I was asking the witness! Edgeworth: *sigh* No need to be so rude. Judge: Well, young lady? Melissa: ... Of course she didn't fall down. The man in the prison uniform grabbed her before she could. Mia: ... Armando: Ha...! We're one step too slow... Edgeworth: And then, what did the defendant do after that?Melissa: Then he carried her over to the car.Press Mia: Mia: You personally witnessed that? Melissa: Y-Yes... Mia: Did anything strange happen when he did that? Melissa: Well, I don't know if you'd call it strange or not... ...but that's when the victim's scarf fell off. Judge: Hmm... You mean this scarf!? Edgeworth: Her words match what we found at the scene. I don't see any problem...Melissa: I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.Press Mia: Mia: You mean the defendant carried the body all by himself? Melissa: Y-Yes... Edgeworth: Considering the size of the defendant, I don't think it would be difficult. Mia: Yes, but... Let's remember they were on a narrow bridge that was ready to collapse! Is it even possible for him to have carried a dead body on a bridge like that...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, the fact of the matter is that he DID! That kind of talk is just silly! Mia: (Wow... Why did he get so emotional all of a sudden?) Judge: Ms. Fey, if you think there's some other possibility, please share it with the rest of us.Present Dusky Bridge Map Mia: Mia: A killer not wanting his victim to be found... I can understand that. However! The idea of moving the body for that purpose is clearly odd. There was a much easier way to make sure the body wasn't found! Edgeworth: ... Judge: W-Well? What is it!? Mia: Take another look at the map of the area and you'll see how. There's a river right below the bridge. Earlier Mr. Edgeworth pointed out something interesting about the river. Edgeworth: For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered... Judge: Ahh... Mia: In the kidnapping case 5 years ago, the victim's body was carried away and never found. Melissa: ...! Mia: If 10 murders were to occur at that same spot above the Eagle River... ...you can bet your boots that every other killer would have tossed the body in the water! Judge: Order! Order! Order! I'm not sure if I care for the way you put that, Ms. Fey! But I must admit it does seem odd not to have thrown the body into the river! Melissa: Ooooh...! Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: *sigh* How sad. Perhaps Ms. Fey would do well to try taking a dip in the river herself. After all, you claim to be such an expert in the ways of nature... Mia: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: My point is that no matter how odd you may find the killer's method of body-disposal... ...the fact is that this is what the killer did. None of your arguments have anything to do with what the witness saw. Judge: Hmm... Quite true... Ms. Fey, it seems that your assertion is without merit after all. Mia: Mia: But what the witness claims to have seen is totally ridiculous... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Surely you can't deny that the body was found in the trunk of the car. Judge: That's certainly consistent with what the witness has told us. Mia: Ugh... Edgeworth: Please, witness, go on with your testimony. Melissa: I-I'll try... Edgeworth: All you have to do is tell us only what you saw. Otherwise the mean lady might yell at you again. Mia: (Who is he talking about!?) Melissa: Alright! I-I'll do my best! Changes statement from \"I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.\" to \"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\"Melissa: The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.Press Mia: Mia: What did the man do then? Melissa: Well... Naturally, he got in the car and was about to flee. That's... That's when I came to my senses. I said to myself, \"You have to call the police!\" Edgeworth: And so that's when you called the police? Mia: You're sure that you saw all that with your own eyes? Melissa: Yes. I'm 100% certain.Present Dusky Bridge Map or Witness's Photo Mia: Leads to: \"Well, Ms. Foster... It looks like you've done it this time.\"Melissa: He couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge.Press Mia: Mia: Why do you say that? It's already a broken-down bridge hidden away in the mountains. Doing anything more to hide the corpse would be going overboard, wouldn't it? Melissa: Yes, but that mountain is famous among hikers. A surprising number of people go up there. Mia: But it's February, right? And it was raining that day, correct? Melissa: There is also a small temple and a channeling dojo there. You know those monks... They just love cold, isolated places... Edgeworth: I think the witness is trying to say that the corpse could have been found at any time... Besides, the witness is merely reporting what she witnessed with her own eyes. Melissa: ...Melissa: Oh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.Press Mia: Mia: And you're absolutely certain that it was my client who was carrying the body? Melissa: ... Well, he was wearing a prisoner's uniform, but... as for his face... Judge: So you're saying you didn't get a clear look at his face? Melissa: Well, they were far away and it was raining as well. I-I thought I was only supposed to say exactly what I saw... Judge: Excellent! You're a remarkably honest young woman!Mia: (Something about this testimony is bothering me, but what...?)Armando: Hey, Kitten... Have you ever put salt in your coffee?Mia: No... Why would I!?Armando: Why not?Mia: Huh...?Armando: It may actually go better with coffee than sugar, right?Mia: ...Armando: Listen. My point is if you're not sure, you might as well add a ton of salt to it. It might... bring out the rust in something. Like a piece of evidence.Mia: (He's right, Mia... Go present something. You've got nothing to lose!)Armando: By the way, I wouldn't put salt in my coffee. The two don't go well, after all.-- Running From the Crime --Melissa: After he stabbed her in the back, he quickly picked her up in his arms.Press Mia: Mia: Are you saying that the victim didn't fall down on the bridge? Melissa: Err... Umm... Actually, maybe she did fall. Edgeworth: Of course she didn't fall down on the bridge. If she had fallen down, this photo wouldn't make any sense. If that was the case, her coat would've been all muddy. Mia: Mia: If you don't mind, I was asking the witness! Edgeworth: *sigh* No need to be so rude. Judge: Well, young lady? Melissa: ... Of course she didn't fall down. The man in the prison uniform grabbed her before she could. Mia: ... Armando: Ha...! We're one step too slow... Edgeworth: And then, what did the defendant do after that?Melissa: Then he carried her over to the car.Press Mia: Mia: You personally witnessed that? Melissa: Y-Yes... Mia: Did anything strange happen when he did that? Melissa: Well, I don't know if you'd call it strange or not... ...but that's when the victim's scarf fell off. Judge: Hmm... You mean this scarf!? Edgeworth: Her words match what we found at the scene. I don't see any problem...Melissa: I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.Press Mia: Mia: You mean the defendant carried the body all by himself? Melissa: Y-Yes... Edgeworth: Considering the size of the defendant, I don't think it would be difficult. Mia: Yes, but... Let's remember they were on a narrow bridge that was ready to collapse! Is it even possible for him to have carried a dead body on a bridge like that...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, the fact of the matter is that he DID! That kind of talk is just silly! Mia: (Wow... Why did he get so emotional all of a sudden?) Judge: Ms. Fey, if you think there's some other possibility, please share it with the rest of us.Present Dusky Bridge Map Mia: Mia: A killer not wanting his victim to be found... I can understand that. However! The idea of moving the body for that purpose is clearly odd. There was a much easier way to make sure the body wasn't found! Edgeworth: ... Judge: W-Well? What is it!? Mia: Take another look at the map of the area and you'll see how. There's a river right below the bridge. Earlier Mr. Edgeworth pointed out something interesting about the river. Edgeworth: For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered... Judge: Ahh... Mia: In the kidnapping case 5 years ago, the victim's body was carried away and never found. Melissa: ...! Mia: If 10 murders were to occur at that same spot above the Eagle River... ...you can bet your boots that every other killer would have tossed the body in the water! Judge: Order! Order! Order! I'm not sure if I care for the way you put that, Ms. Fey! But I must admit it does seem odd not to have thrown the body into the river! Melissa: Ooooh...! Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: *sigh* How sad. Perhaps Ms. Fey would do well to try taking a dip in the river herself. After all, you claim to be such an expert in the ways of nature... Mia: What are you talking about? Edgeworth: My point is that no matter how odd you may find the killer's method of body-disposal... ...the fact is that this is what the killer did. None of your arguments have anything to do with what the witness saw. Judge: Hmm... Quite true... Ms. Fey, it seems that your assertion is without merit after all. Mia: Mia: But what the witness claims to have seen is totally ridiculous... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Surely you can't deny that the body was found in the trunk of the car. Judge: That's certainly consistent with what the witness has told us. Mia: Ugh... Edgeworth: Please, witness, go on with your testimony. Melissa: I-I'll try... Edgeworth: All you have to do is tell us only what you saw. Otherwise the mean lady might yell at you again. Mia: (Who is he talking about!?) Melissa: Alright! I-I'll do my best! Changes statement from \"I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.\" to \"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\"Melissa: The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.Press Mia: Mia: What did the man do then? Melissa: Well... Naturally, he got in the car and was about to flee. That's... That's when I came to my senses. I said to myself, \"You have to call the police!\" Edgeworth: And so that's when you called the police? Mia: You're sure that you saw all that with your own eyes? Melissa: Yes. I'm 100% certain.Present Dusky Bridge Map or Witness's Photo Mia: Leads to: \"Well, Ms. Foster... It looks like you've done it this time.\"Melissa: He couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge.Press Mia: Mia: Why do you say that? It's already a broken-down bridge hidden away in the mountains. Doing anything more to hide the corpse would be going overboard, wouldn't it? Melissa: Yes, but that mountain is famous among hikers. A surprising number of people go up there. Mia: But it's February, right? And it was raining that day, correct? Melissa: There is also a small temple and a channeling dojo there. You know those monks... They just love cold, isolated places... Edgeworth: I think the witness is trying to say that the corpse could have been found at any time... Besides, the witness is merely reporting what she witnessed with her own eyes. Melissa: ...Melissa: Oh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.Press Mia: Mia: And you're absolutely certain that it was my client who was carrying the body? Melissa: ... Well, he was wearing a prisoner's uniform, but... as for his face... Judge: So you're saying you didn't get a clear look at his face? Melissa: Well, they were far away and it was raining as well. I-I thought I was only supposed to say exactly what I saw... Judge: Excellent! You're a remarkably honest young woman!Mia: (Something about this testimony is bothering me, but what...?)Armando: Hey, Kitten... Have you ever put salt in your coffee?Mia: No... Why would I!?Armando: Why not?Mia: Huh...?Armando: It may actually go better with coffee than sugar, right?Mia: ...Armando: Listen. My point is if you're not sure, you might as well add a ton of salt to it. It might... bring out the rust in something. Like a piece of evidence.Mia: (He's right, Mia... Go present something. You've got nothing to lose!)Armando: By the way, I wouldn't put salt in my coffee. The two don't go well, after all.Mia: Well, Ms. Foster... It looks like you've done it this time.Melissa: ...? D-Done what?Mia: Made a crucial mistake.Judge: A c-crucial mistake? Like what, Ms. Fey!?Mia: \"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\" You're saying you saw that, right? With your very own eyes?Melissa: Y-Yes... And...?Mia: It's simple, Ms. Foster. Take a look at the diagram. The place you claim to have taken the photo from that day is here. Do you see what I mean? Even if you tried to see the car... ...this outcropping of rock is directly in the way.Melissa: Ah...!Mia: That's right, Ms. Foster. From where you were standing, you could not have possibly seen the killer's car.Melissa: Aaaaah...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I admit that the diagram shows a large outcropping of rock. However... It isn't so tall that it would stop her from seeing the car!Melissa: Th-That's right! It-It's not high at all... I-I was able to see his car just fine!Mia: I'm so sorry... But that just doesn't wash.Melissa: ...!Mia: I believe it was the witness who presented this as evidence to the court, yes? This is the location that the photo was taken from. Your own photo tells the whole story! You can clearly see the left side of the bridge... But the outcropping that is being referred to is really more like a cliff.Judge: Ah!Mia: Your view should have been completely cut off by this cliff! But still you claim to have been able to see the killer's car!Melissa: ... Noooooo!Judge: Or-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of all this ballyhoo...!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Your Honor... Don't jump to any hasty conclusions. The fact that the escapee fled in a stolen car was reported on the news. After witnessing a murder, I'm sure you can appreciate that the witness was very upset. She must have heard about the stolen car and convinced herself that she saw it.Mia:Mia: But she was repeatedly warned before starting her testimony! She was told to testify only about what she saw with her own eyes!Judge: Hmmmmm... Oh!Melissa: Err... Mr. Judge?Judge: Wh-What is it?Melissa: I think... I think I must have remembered things wrong...Mia:Mia: Hey! Wait a minute! You can't just say that...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Ms. Fey, no one on the face of the planet is perfect.Judge: Hmmmm... Yes, indeed... Quite true! You know what they say... \"To err is human, to forgive, divine.\" I'm inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to our witness here.Mia: What...!? Th-That's not fair...!Armando: Ha...! Save the tears for later, Kitten!Mia: M-Mr. Armando!Armando: Don't look back until the trial is over. Now is the time to go forward.Mia: B-But...! But that wasn't fair!Armando: OK, Kitten, you need to relax. Then you need to remember... The other kitten's testimony!Melissa: The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.Armando: So tell me... How did she know that? (Changed from [So tell us... How did you know that?] in the original release) How did she know that he broke into the trunk? (Changed from [How did you know that he broke into the trunk?] in the original release)Mia: Aha...!Armando: Well, Ms. Foster? Until you can explain how you knew that... (Changed from [Until you can explain how you knew that...] in the original release) ...you're going to have a lot of very suspicious people on this side of the courtroom.Melissa: ...Judge: W-Well, witness?Melissa: Well, I'm certain that he broke into the trunk. Because... Because there were marks left on the trunk lid. I'm certain they were scratch marks from when he broke into it...!Judge: W-What...!? L-Let me see that photo! It's true... These certainly look like scratch marks around the keyhole! HMMMM...! It's obvious that this trunk has been broken open. Well, Ms. Fey? Are you satisfied...?Mia: (The judge is on her side! I can't make any mistakes here! What she just said... Is there a contradiction in there somewhere...?)I'll buy it Mia: (Something about it still doesn't feel right, but...) I, err... OK, I guess I'm satisfied... Sort of. Edgeworth: I hope this has cleared up any doubts... Judge: Indeed, I believe it has. Armando: Hey Kitten, this is no time to play around! Mia: Huh...? Armando: Overlooking such a huge contradiction... What am I going do with you? Mia: (Contradiction...!? So that wasn't my imagination after all!) Judge: Very well, let's move on to the next... Mia: Mia: J-Just a minute! Judge: What is it now, Ms. Fey!? Mia: I've got a big problem with what this witness said! Judge: ... I'd appreciate it if you didn't change your mind every 5 seconds! Mia: (Ugh... Hang in there, Mia!) Leads to: \"Melissa Foster.\"It doesn't work. Leads to: \"Melissa Foster.\"Mia: Melissa Foster. It looks like you've finally betrayed yourself.Melissa: What...!?Mia: You said you were in a field taking photos of wild flowers. But even so, you knew about the scratches... The question is when! When did you get a chance to see those scratches!?Melissa: ...Mia: (Finally...! I've finally got her!)Armando: Ha...! I'm getting pretty tired of waiting over here!Edgeworth: Then perhaps it would be faster if Ms. Fey explained herself.Mia: Your Honor! There's only one possible explanation! The reason the witness had seen the scratches was...she happened to be passing by. Mia: Because she just happened to be passing by the area where the car was parked! Judge: ... Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Frankly, Your Honor, after hearing a pathetic response like that... I have to question whether or not such a pathetic lawyer should even exist... Judge: Did you hear that Ms. Fey? I believe Mr. Edgeworth just called you a canucklehead. Mia: (Yeesh, isn't that overdoing things a little bit...? Come on, Mia! One more time! You can do it!) Leads back to: \"Your Honor! There's only one possible explanation!\"she put the corpse in herself. Leads to: \"There's only one way that the witness had the chance to see those scratches.\"she is the owner of the car. Mia: Because the stolen car actually belonged to her. That is why she knew about the scratches! Judge: ... Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Frankly, Your Honor, after hearing a pathetic response like that... I have to question whether or not such a pathetic lawyer should even exist... Judge: Did you hear that Ms. Fey? I believe Mr. Edgeworth just called you a canucklehead. Mia: (Yeesh, isn't that overdoing things a little bit...? Come on, Mia! One more time! You can do it!) Leads back to: \"Your Honor! There's only one possible explanation!\"Mia: There's only one way that the witness had the chance to see those scratches.Judge: Y-Yes? What was it?Mia: Naturally... When she opened the trunk... and stuffed the corpse in herself!Edgeworth: ...!Mia: The person who really hid the body in the trunk of that car was... Melissa Foster! It was you that did it, wasn't it!?Melissa: Th-That's ridiculous! I could never...! It was the man in the prison garb! He-He's the one that...Mia: I don't think so, Ms. Foster. If Mr. Fawles had been the one that put the corpse in the trunk... ...he would have simply used the car key. There was no need to break it open.Melissa: B-But...! He stole the car...!Mia: He stole it from a young couple that had been waiting at a red light. Which means that the key would have still been in the ignition.Melissa: Oh...! I-I... I see...Mia: Thank you for telling us about the scratches, Ms. Foster. Without that, we never would have uncovered the truth. That it couldn't have been Mr. Fawles that put the body in the trunk! (Changed from [It couldn't have been Mr. Fawles that put the body in the trunk!] in the original release)Melissa: Nooooo!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: P-Preposterous! To even suggest that the witness put the body in there! If that were true... then how do you explain the photo that she took? The corpse could only have been put in the trunk when the incident occurred. And we already know that at the time, she was taking photographs!Mia: (Now is your chance, Mia! Finish this thing!) On the contrary, I'm not so certain about that anymore, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth: ...!Mia: There's no need to think too deeply about it. What I'm saying is the shutter for this may not have been pushed by Ms. Foster herself!Present Camera Mia: Leads to: \"Let's take another look at this camera, and see what features it has, shall we?\"Present anything else Mia: Mia: Well, Your Honor? Judge: To be quite honest, Ms. Fey... I wish you would have thought a little more deeply on this matter. Mia: Huh? Armando: Hey Kitten... Don't start getting all sloppy on me now. The fact is, she wasn't there, but the photo got taken. So how did it happen? This is a fastball right over home plate. Mia: (That's what I thought, but...) Judge: Ms. Fey, take a moment and think it over again. Leads back to: \"There's no need to think too deeply about it.\"Mia: Let's take another look at this camera, and see what features it has, shall we? (Changed from [I don't think you can make a mistake about it. Take a look at her camera.] in the original release) It has a timer built into it! Even a mini-tripod!Judge: Hmmmm...!Mia: Almost as if the camera was brought just to take this picture!Melissa: ...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: What are you trying to say then, Ms. Fey!? That when the crime occurred, Ms. Foster wasn't in the field as she claimed!?Mia: (Well, if she really did use the camera's auto-timer... ...then the answer is yes, she was somewhere else.) Exactly. She was NOT in the field.Judge: Hmm... Would the defense please explain further.Armando: Listen... This is a crucial point. \"Where was Ms. Foster when the incident occurred...?\" In answering that question, we'll also make clear Ms. Foster's true identity.Judge: Well then, please answer this question. Where was Melissa Foster when the incident on the bridge occurred?Present victim's location Mia: Leads to: \"Naturally, the witness was right here!\"Present car Mia: Mia: Naturally the witness was right... here! ...I think. Judge: Hmm... In the spot where the defendant's car was? Mia: Yes! She had to put the body in the trunk before the defendant returned! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You don't mind if I ask one teenie-weenie question, do you, Ms. Fey...? Mia: (Uh oh. He's got that condescending tone in his voice...) Edgeworth: If she put the body in the trunk at that time, as you suggest... ...that must mean that Valerie Hawthorne was already dead at that point, correct? Judge: Hmm, indeed. Edgeworth: Please take a look at the top of Dusky Bridge. It certainly looks to me like the victim is still alive... Am I mistaken? Mia: Err... Edgeworth: If Valerie Hawthorne was already dead, then... who is this? The mountain is famous for spirits, so maybe you think it was the ghost of the victim? Mia: ... Well, it COULD have been a spirit... Right? Judge: Ms. Fey! Don't waste the court's time with this kind of foolishness! Mia: A-Anyway! I still maintain that the witness was in a different place at the time! Judge: Are you certain? Mia: Yes, I am certain! More or less. Judge: Oh, come now, Ms. Fey... Leads back to: \"Well then, please answer this question.\"Present anywhere else Mia: Mia: Naturally, the witness was standing right here! Judge: Hmmmmm... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: *sigh* Before pointing out where the witness was standing, Ms. Fey should do something herself. She should figure out where SHE stands, if you catch my drift! Mia: (Oh don't worry, the drift was certainly caught...) Judge: Yes, failure is an excellent opportunity for growth. Now try better next time. Mia: Ah, yes... Thank you... Leads back to: \"Well then, please answer this question.\"Mia: Naturally, the witness was right here!Judge: B-But that's... But that's where the victim, Ms. Hawthorne was standing! Order! Order! Order! Ms. Fey! What on earth...!?Mia: Your Honor, if I may... After parting with the \"victim\" on the bridge, the defendant fled by car. But this would mean that there was no time to put the victim in the trunk. In other words, if someone put the body in the trunk... ...it could only have been before the defendant met the \"victim\"!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: How asinine! Of course Mr. Fawles met with the victim! The only person with the opportunity to have put the victim in the trunk... ...is the same man that killed her: Terry Fawles!Mia:Mia: You still don't understand, do you, Mr. Edgeworth? By the time the witness's photo was taken, the victim was already dead... The person in the photo was NOT Valerie Hawthorne!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: What!? I've never heard anything more ridiculous in my entire life! Then who exactly is the \"victim\" in this photo!?Mia: It's obvious, isn't it? It's your own witness.Melissa: ...!Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaaat...!?Mia: It's the only possible explanation. The woman that Mr. Fawles met on the bridge that day was not Valerie Hawthorne! It was you! Melissa Foster!Melissa: M-M-Me...!?Mia: Let's remember that it was raining and foggy on the mountain that day. Mr. Fawles himself believed that the woman in front of him was Valerie Hawthorne!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: But the defendant knew Valerie Hawthorne very well! After all, she was the woman whose testimony helped get him convicted!Mia:Mia: But since then, my client has spent five hard years in a federal penitentiary! He couldn't remember exactly what she looked like anymore!Edgeworth: You are just making this up as you go along! Where's your proof!?Mia: (I've got it all right here! This piece of evidence will blow this case wide open...!) At the time of the incident, Mr. Fawles had forgotten what Valerie Hawthorne looked like!Present Victim's Note or Scarf Mia: Leads to: \"Mr. Fawles had forgotten the victim's face.\"Present anything else Mia: Armando: Wait a minute, Kitten. Mia: M-Mr. Armando... Armando: First of all, relax. Second of all, think the whole thing over again! Mia: (H-He's right, Mia! You need to calm down and think it over!) Leads back to: \"He couldn't remember exactly what she looked like anymore!\"Mia: Mr. Fawles had forgotten the victim's face. That's why he needed some piece of identification. Namely, this muddy scarf!Melissa: Ah...!Mia: It was Mr. Fawles who requested that she wear this scarf to identify herself. That's already been proven by the note the victim left!Edgeworth: ...Mia: In other words, as long as you were wearing a scarf like he asked... ...anyone could have pretended to be Valerie Hawthorne!Melissa: ...Mia: Well? What do you have to say to that, Melissa Foster!?Melissa: Nnng...Gggh...Unnn...! N-N-N-N-N-Nnnnoooooooo!!!Judge: Err... Ahh... Where's Ms. Foster...?Edgeworth: She's collecting herself in the Lobby.Judge: Hmmmmm...Mia: (It's obvious that Melissa Foster did it. She hid the body in the trunk and disguised herself as the victim... She set up the camera to snap a fake photo of them together...)Armando: The only question is... why did she do it...?Mia: Well, isn't that obvious? She's the real culprit! (Changed from [She's the true criminal!] in the original release)Armando: Ha...!Judge: Well, we'll have to wait for Ms. Foster to compose herself before we start again. Until then, this court is in recess. The defense and the prosecution are both to wait in their respective lobbies. (Changed from [The defense and the prosecution are instructed to wait in the lobby.] in the original release)Mia: Yes, Your Honor.Edgeworth: Understood.Judge: Very well! This court is in recess!To be continued.February 16, 1:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4Mia: Mr. Fawles, I...Fawles: UGGAAAA!Mia: Eeeeeek! I'm sorry! I-I'm sorry!Fawles: I wanna say thanks. You're real good! You really hooked me up!Mia: Thanks! We're almost there! Once I prove that she committed the crime...Armando: ...Yeah, but there's one more big obstacle we've got to get past.Mia: Ob-Obstacle...?Armando: Yeah. Motive. Why would Melissa Foster kill that policewoman anyway?Mia: (Motive, huh...)Armando: Anyway... We're still badly in need of information.Mia: Information... Right...Armando: What we need the most is info about this Melissa Foster herself. All we know is that she's a student studying literature. And one more thing.Mia: ...What is it?Armando: Well, the incident that happened 5 years ago, of course. The kidnapping-murder case that Zebra Boy is on death row for...Fawles: I din't do nuttin'! I din't kill nobody! I never lie!Mia: Mr. Fawles! In that case... Tell us more about it. ...About what happened 5 years ago.Fawles: ... OK. I trust you. That day. 5 years ago. I dream of it. Every day. This picture. It reminds me everything. Bridge looks same. Just like then... 5 years ago... Like it could fall apart... Fall apart any minute...Mia: (So it's been broken like that for at least 5 years...)Armando: Ha...! Sorry buddy, but you sound like the one that could fall apart at any minute.Fawles: It true. I did... ...I did kidnap her. ...Five years ago. I kidnapped. My girlfriend. Dahlia Hawthorne.Mia: Y-Your g-girlfriend? Huh...?Armando: Hey, hold on there! Did you say, \"Hawthorne\"!?Mia: (The victim's last name...!)Fawles: Dahlia Hawthorne... Valerie's little sister.Mia: Wh-Wh-Whaaat!? Are you serious!?The girl... Let her go!Shut up! C-Come closer... And I kill her!Sorry, but you're not going to get the chance...Mia: (The detective back then was Valerie Hawthorne!) At first I thought shooting someone for a kidnapping was crossing the line, but... If it was to protect her little sister, I can understand why she did it...Fawles: Wrong! No protect sister! Valerie betray me! Betray us!Mia: What do you mean she betrayed you!?Fawles: Everything. All lies. All make-believe. Kidnapping, too...Mia: A make-believe kidnapping?Fawles: Dahlia. My girlfriend. My love. My Teen Angel.Mia: (Ugh. Did he actually say, \"My Teen Angel\"? He's seen one too many soap operas.)Fawles: I do anything she says. Anything Dahlia says...Mia: (\"Anything Dahlia says\"...?) H-Hold on a minute! What you're saying is that the kidnapping 5 years ago was planned by...Fawles: Yeah. Me and Dahlia... ...And Valerie, too.Mia: (Valerie was in on it!?)Fawles: Dahlia's family rich. Jewelry business. We get one jewel... That's what we thought... Me and Dahlia wrote kidnap note. We send to her dad. Asked for 2 million dollar diamond. Tell him make exchange on Dusky Bridge. ...We tell him Valerie make transfer 'cause she new detective.Armando: Having a police detective in your pocket is a useful thing alright. In the end, you were planning on splitting the 2 million three ways, huh...Fawles: Yeah, but! That woman! That woman! Valerie! She do it for real! She shoot at me for real! Me and Dahlia!*BANG!*Fawles: I was shot in arm. Dahlia... She jump in river.Mia: Jump...? You don't mean she jumped on purpose, do you?Fawles: I couldn't do it! I could never push her...! Anyway, I blacked out... Wake up with police all over.Armando: ...And that's when they decided to give you the death sentence.Fawles: I couldn't believe it. That woman. She betrayed me.Valerie: That man... Terry Fawles... He killed her! He threw her off the bridge! He threw my beloved sister into the roaring river 40 feet below!Fawles: ...These 5 years... All I wonder is... Why! ...Why! ...Why! ...Why! Why did she lie!? That's all I want to know!Armando: So that's why you called her. You wanted to hear the truth from Valerie herself.Fawles: Yes... but I forget what she look like. So I tell her to wear scarf. I don't want to hurt her! ...Just ask why! Why! Why did you lie...? Why did you betray me...? I just want to hear answer come from her mouth. That's all!Mia: (So that's why... That's why you made a crazy escape like that...)Armando: Just one thing, Zebra Boy... My senses are tingling all over. Tell me, Mr. Fawles... Where is it?Mia: ...Huh? Where's what?Armando: Come on now, Kitten... The ransom. The 2 million dollar diamond. Remember that now? Did you give it back to Pops? Did the police take it?Fawles: ...I dunno.Mia: Huh? You don't know?Fawles: No really. I dunno. It's gone. With Dahlia.Mia: ...With Dahlia?Fawles: That day. On the bridge... Dahlia put it. In backpack... Now gone. With Dahlia. Gone... Forever... Into Eagle River...Mia: (It disappeared with Dahlia, huh...? Wait a minute...!)Bailiff: ...You can come back in now! We're about ready to go!Mia: Mr. Fawles! Just one more question! When you said, \"with Dahlia\", do you mean the diamond is still missing...? Along with the body of Dahlia Hawthorne?Fawles: ... Never found her... My sweet Dahlia...Mia: (They never found her...!)Fawles: Swallowed by river... Gone... Dahlia... My Teen Angel...Armando: Your \"Teen Angel\"...? How old was she anyway?Fawles: Just 14...Mia: F-F-Fourteen!? (I guess you were robbing cradles before diamonds...)Armando: She plans a fake kidnapping and disappears into the river with a rock worth 2 mil... Man oh man... Angels these days.Mia: (Fawles takes the fall... And gets a one-way ticket to Death Row... Is Dahlia Hawthorne an angel or is she really a...)Armando: ...It's time, Kitten. It looks like we have a few more aces up our sleeve now.Mia: ...You bet!Diamond added to the Court Record.Armando: The training wheels come off now, Mia! You've got to strike while the iron is hot! That's one of my rules. Remember it.February 16, 1:49 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: Now then, let's continue with the trial of Mr. Terry Fawles. ...Witness. Are you feeling better?Melissa: Y-Yes, Your Honor... I-I'll try my best.Judge: Hmm... You're a brave young lady.Mia: (Not this again...)Edgeworth: I can understand a defense lawyer wanting to get her client off the hook... However! To try to pin the crime on an innocent student is...Mia: What are you talking about!?Edgeworth: My witness is not the person on trial here. She's an innocent bystander who witnessed a violent crime. ...That's all. What possible reason would a girl like this have for murdering a policewoman!Judge: Hmm... It's certainly hard to imagine this woman as a murderer...Mia: (Her motive, huh... I figured that's what I had to establish next...)Judge: Well, Ms. Fey? Do you have any evidence of a motive?Mia: ... Err, yes! Of course! ...I think.Armando: Hah...! You're still acting as tame as a kitten... Kitten.Mia: Mr. Armando...Armando: Listen... A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets.Mia: ...!Armando: Smiling on the outside while your guts are twisted in knots is the mark of a pro.Mia: ...Maybe so, but I wish you would quit grinning at me like that.Melissa: Umm... Excuse me... May I speak, Mr. Judge?Judge: Of course! Mr. Judge is ready anytime you like!Melissa: I'd like... I'd like to say something. Some people here are suspicious of me, right? Th-That's why... I... I at least wanted you, Mr. Judge, to know that it's not true...Judge: Hmmmmm! I see! You're such an honest and upstanding young lady.Armando: It looks like this witness is a real professional.Mia: Wh-What do you mean!?Armando: Look at that 100-watt smile. ...Just when things are darkest for her... CLICK. She lights right up!Judge: Very well then! Let's hear what the witness has to say!Witness Testimony-- Melissa Foster's History --Melissa: I... I was out of the country until the year before last. Until I entered college, I had never even been to Eagle Mountain before... And I certainly don't have any reason for wanting to hurt a police officer. Holding a grudge and killing the officer who testified against you 5 years ago... Or kidnapping a poor girl... I just think the defendant is a terrible, horrible monster!Judge: Hmm... Out of the country, eh...Edgeworth: Precisely. Furthermore, she has no possible motive for committing murder.Judge: Hmm, indeed...Armando: You're up to bat, Kitten. Sharpen those claws and put on your best smile.Mia: Y-You bet! (Somehow, I have to tie her to this case...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Melissa Foster's History --Melissa: I... I was out of the country until the year before last.Press Mia: Mia: So, what country were you living in then? Melissa: We were all living abroad, but after my parents were killed... Edgeworth: It was a brutal civil war. She had to try to make her way back home alone... Melissa: I lost everything... I didn't even have any personal identification... Mia: (What kind of sob story is this...? ...What do I do? Should I press her for details?) Wait and see Mia: (There's nothing I can do about her claim to have lost all her identification. All I can do is wait to find some other evidence about her real identity.) Judge: Very well then, Ms. Foster. Please proceed. Leads back to cross-examination Press her harder Mia: ...Witness. Answer my question. I'll even repeat it for you. What country were you in? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this line of questioning is childish. What country she was in and how many languages she may speak are irrelevant here. What we're here to evaluate is whether this witness has any connection to this case. Melissa: I've lived abroad ever since I was a little girl... That's why I could never have known Mr. Fawles or Detective Hawthorne. Edgeworth: Yes... I think we've established that point. Judge: Yes, indeed. Well then. Shall we add what you've just stated to the official testimony? Melissa: Yes, please. ...Mr. Judge. Adds statement \"Naturally, I didn't know either the victim or the defendant.\"Press (after adding statement \"Naturally, I didn't know either the victim or the defendant.\") Mia: Mia: So, what country were you living in then? Melissa: We were all living abroad, but after my parents were killed... Edgeworth: It was a brutal civil war. She had to try to make her way back home alone... Melissa: I lost everything... I didn't even have any personal identification... Mia: (What kind of sob story is this...?)Melissa: Naturally, I didn't know either the victim or the defendant.Press Mia: Mia: You didn't know either person? Are you certain of that? Melissa: Yes. I'm afraid I'm rather shy around people. Judge: Hmm... Oh well, that can't be helped. Mia: (Why is he just agreeing with everything that comes out of her mouth...?) Judge: The first time you saw either of them was when they were on the bridge, correct? Melissa: Yes... It really was a coincidence.Melissa: Until I entered college, I had never even been to Eagle Mountain before...Press Mia: Mia: So what made you decide to go to Eagle Mountain anyway? Melissa: I just love being outdoors... Picnics, hiking... You know, that sort of thing. Mia: (...You don't look like much of a hiker to me. But you do look like a digger of sorts.) But Eagle Mountain is a two-hour drive from here and no trains run through there. There are plenty of mountains that are closer and easier to get to. Melissa: Well, I went there once with the college Hiking Club. I fell in love with its stark, desolate beauty and its cold, yet romantic, gloominess... Mia: (Didn't know you were such a goth...) By the way, what's the name of your college...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The prosecution objects to any questions that involve the witness's private life. Mia: ...! Edgeworth: All that matters is that she is a material witness to a crime. The witness doesn't need to respond to questions that are clearly malicious in intent. Melissa: Thank you! She's really gone too far...! Judge: Hmmmmm! Ms. Fey! You're treading on thin ice here! Mia: (I hardly said anything! Talk about sensitive...)Melissa: And I certainly don't have any reason for wanting to hurt a police officer.Press Mia: Mia: Perhaps, but your behavior that day was very suspicious! Not only have you contradicted yourself here in court, but you know things you shouldn't. For example, the scratches on the trunk of the car. Melissa: Well th-that's... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately Ms. Fey, your last statement proves nothing. Mia: Oh really!? And why is that? Edgeworth: The witness came to the police station once to identify the suspect. It's entirely possible that, at that time, an officer showed her this photo. Judge: Hmm... That seems like a rather serious mistake. Armando: Ha...! That's the oldest trick in the prosecutor's book. Mia: Th-That's not fair...! Melissa: That wicked inmate... I'll never be able to forget that horrible day...Melissa: Holding a grudge and killing the officer who testified against you 5 years ago...Press Mia: Mia: A grudge...? Melissa: Well, the policewoman's testimony was crucial, wasn't it? ...Crucial in getting the defendant sentenced to death. Edgeworth: Yes, and that's precisely why he harbored such deep anger against her. So much anger that he forgot his own guilt... Mia: Mia: My client has always maintained that he's innocent of those charges! Melissa: He seems rather forgetful. ...Your client, I mean. Mia: ...! Melissa: Not only did he forget about what he did, but he forgot the poor policewoman as well. Mia: What do you mean by that? Melissa: Your client... He forgot what the detective looked like, right? It's too bad for her that he didn't forget about her testimony as well. Mia: (Well, she's right about that. Mr. Fawles is kind of forgetful...) Wait and see Mia: (Any more damage to my client's image could be a disaster... The judge already has a bad enough opinion of him...) Judge: You just can't trust someone with a bad memory. What did you eat for dinner one week ago today? ...At the very least, a person should remember that much. As for me, it was payday, so I had a nice moose steak with some poutine on the side. Mia: (...And how does this relate to anything!?) Edgeworth: Whether it's eating steak or committing murder, a person shouldn't deny their actions. I'm in complete agreement, Your Honor. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Mia: You said, \"he forgot what the detective looked like.\" What did you mean by that? Melissa: Well he couldn't tell who she was without some kind of identification, right? Edgeworth: Quite right... That's why the victim was wearing a scarf as identification. Melissa: Why, if I had been wearing a white scarf that day... ...then he probably would have tried to kill me... Judge: Hmm... That's true. He's clearly a bitter man! Mia: (This is bad. Mr. Fawles's reputation just keeps getting worse and worse. Sometimes it's best not to poke too deep... What should I do with that last statement?) Have it added to the testimony Mia: Your Honor! What the witness said just now was tremendously important! I'd like it added to the official testimony! Edgeworth: The prosecution has no objection... After all, the defendant is a killer and a mentally unbalanced one at that... That testimony only helps to further prove that point... Judge: Hmm...! Mia: N-No, that's not why I... Judge: Enough. ...Witness, if you would? Melissa: My pleasure, Mr. Judge. Adds statement \"I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.\" Leave it alone Mia: (Any more damage to my client's image could be a disaster... The judge already has a bad enough opinion of him...) Judge: You just can't trust someone with a bad memory. What did you eat for dinner one week ago today? ...At the very least, a person should remember that much. As for me, it was payday, so I had a nice moose steak with some poutine on the side.

Melissa: Well, the policewoman's testimony was crucial, wasn't it? ...Crucial in getting the defendant sentenced to death. Edgeworth: Yes, and that's precisely why he harbored such deep anger against her. So much anger that he forgot his own guilt... Mia: Mia: My client has always maintained that he's innocent of those charges! Melissa: He seems rather forgetful. ...Your client, I mean. Mia: ...! Melissa: Not only did he forget about what he did, but he forgot the poor policewoman as well.Melissa: I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.Press Mia: Mia: What do you mean by lucky? Melissa: Well... It's February now. Everyone is wearing scarves. If I had accidentally worn a white scarf like he said... Edgeworth: Then you yourself might have been killed. Judge: Hmmmmm... That would've been a terrible loss for this world! Armando: Ha...! It looks like you pressed too hard this time, Kitten. Mia: Mr. Armando... Armando: Keep looking around you and you're going to lose sight of the finish line. Justice is blind, but she's not deaf. Sometimes you have to know when not to talk.Present Scarf Mia: Mia: Witness... I want you to look at this photo you took. It's hard to see in the photo, but look at the scarf the victim wore as identification. Judge: Ah, you are talking about this scarf right here, eh? Melissa: Y-Yes! That's it! The scarf the policewoman was wearing... Mia: (I've got her now, just don't mess up...) ...But that's strange. In your testimony, you stated the following... \"I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.\" Judge: Wh-White? Mia: ...This is the scarf you identified as belonging to the victim. But it certainly doesn't look white to me! Melissa: Oh...! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, it was foggy that day... And it was raining as well! It's not surprising that she mistook it for white! Mia: Mia: Sorry, but not this time. The witness just confirmed that this was the victim's scarf! Judge: Yes, but... What's the significance...? It's true that the scarf doesn't look white, but... Mia: There's only one explanation for this mix-up! The reason why the witness thought the scarf was white is...! Present Victim's Note Mia: Leads to: \"...Witness. Have you ever seen this note?\" Present anything else Mia: Mia: Here's the definitive piece of evidence that proves it! Melissa: ... Edgeworth: ...... Judge: That...? That's your definitive piece of evidence? Mia: Yes! ...If my thinking is correct. Edgeworth: Well then. We have one mystery solved! The answer is simple. Ms. Fey's thinking is wrong. ...That's all there is to it. Mia: Huh? Armando: Please, Kitten. You've got to do something... You're killing me over here. Judge: Ms. Fey, I've got a definitive penalty to reward you for your definitive piece of evidence. Mia: (Well, that wasn't what I was expecting...) Judge: Well... Do you have evidence or not? Perhaps you can tell us about why the witness thought the scarf was white, eh... Leads back to: \"There's only one explanation for this mix-up!\" Mia: ...Witness. Have you ever seen this note? Melissa: N-Note...? I, err... No, never... Judge: It's top-secret evidence. There's no reason that you would have. Mia: Hmm, I wonder about that... Melissa: Wh-What do you mean...? Mia: This note shows Mr. Fawles's instructions to the victim regarding their meeting. It says... \"Wear white scarf for identification.\" Edgeworth: White... Scarf...? AAAAAAH!!! Mia: Witness! You KNEW what this note said! And it's because you knew, that you slipped up and mistakenly said \"white scarf\"! (Changed from [There's no other possible reason for you to mistake the scarf's color!] in the original release) Leads to: \"Ugh... Unn... Urgh...!\"Present Victim's Note Mia: Mia: ...It's true. Mr. Fawles did give instructions to Valerie Hawthorne about their meeting. The note that she left said: \"Wear white scarf for identification.\" Judge: Yes, what about it...? Mia: Isn't it obvious!? Doesn't it strike you as odd!? That note was a secret piece of evidence! How is it that the witness knows about it!? Melissa: Ah...! Judge: Order! Order! Hmm... It is odd, isn't it? Well, Mr. Edgeworth!? Did you show top-secret evidence to the witness...? Edgeworth: Y-Your Honor... I certainly never gave anyone permission to do such a thing. Mia: In that case, the only way the witness could know about the note would b-- Melissa: J-Just a moment! Of course... Of course I didn't know about the note! It's just... I saw it when it happened. ...With my own eyes. When the victim went to see the killer... She used her own scarf to signal him. That's why... That's why I assumed that the signal was a white scarf. Judge: Hmmm... I suppose that makes sense. Mia: (Come on, Mia! You can't let her weasel out of it that easily!) ...Witness! Sorry, but your explanation isn't going to work here. Melissa: B-But why!? It-It's true! That's what I saw! Mia: Impossible. There's no way you could have seen the victim use a white scarf to signal him! Present Scarf Mia: Leads to: \"You've said several times in your testimony that the victim was wearing a scarf...\" Present anything else Mia: Mia: Here's the definitive piece of evidence that proves it! Melissa: ... Edgeworth: ...... Judge: That...? That's your definitive piece of evidence? Mia: Yes! ...If my thinking is correct. Edgeworth: Well then. We have one mystery solved! The answer is simple. Ms. Fey's thinking is wrong. ...That's all there is to it. Mia: Huh? Armando: Please, Kitten. You've got to do something... You're killing me over here. Judge: Ms. Fey, I've got a definitive penalty to reward you for your definitive piece of evidence. Mia: (Well, that wasn't what I was expecting...) Melissa: Well? ...Do you finally believe me? Mia: (Come on, Mia! You're running out of time...!) Leads back to: \"...Witness! Sorry, but your explanation isn't going to work here.\" Mia: You've said several times in your testimony that the victim was wearing a scarf... ...A white scarf, correct? Melissa: Yes... Is something wrong...? Mia: That's what I'd like to know. ...Ms. Foster. Have a look at this. It's the victim's scarf! Melissa: Ah...! Mia: I'm sure people would disagree about what to call this color. ...However! It certainly is not white! You KNEW what the note said! Edgeworth: She knew... the contents of the note...? N-NOOOOOOOO! Mia: It says, \"Wear white scarf for identification.\" That's the reason why you said it was white! Leads to: \"Ugh... Unn... Urgh...!\"Melissa: Or kidnapping a poor girl... I just think the defendant is a terrible, horrible monster!Press Mia: Mia: You knew about that incident? But weren't you out of the country until the year before last? Melissa: Well, I saw a report about the escaped convict on the news. They had an in-depth report about his whole history. Judge: So you were still living abroad 5 years ago, is that right? Melissa: Yes...Mia: (I can't let her get away with these lies...!)Armando: Listen to me. She's neck-deep in this whole thing...

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a bunch of characters, evidence, and testimonies. The task is to look through the testimonies from Melissa Foster and find which one is contradicted by one of the evidences.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Melissa says in Testimony 3: \"And I certainly don't have any reason for wanting to hurt a police officer.\" She claims she has no motive. But the evidence includes the Diamond (Evidence 8), which was the ransom from the kidnapping 5 years ago. Melissa is actually Dahlia Hawthorne, Valerie's sister, who faked her death. She would have a motive to kill Valerie because Valerie betrayed her and Terry in the fake kidnapping plan. The diamond's existence and Melissa's true identity as Dahlia would give her a motive, contradicting her testimony that she has no reason to hurt a police officer.\n\nSo the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (no reason to hurt) and Evidence 8 (the diamond, indicating her real motive to retrieve it or seek revenge). But wait, maybe another pair. Let me check again.\n\nAnother angle: Melissa's testimony about being out of the country (Testimony 0) might be contradicted by the Diamond, as she's actually Dahlia who was supposed to be dead. But the Diamond's existence links to the past crime she was involved in. Alternatively, the Victim's Note (Evidence 3) mentions the white scarf, and Melissa's Testimony 5 about the white scarf. But that's already covered in another part of the story.\n\nWait, Melissa's Testimony 5 says she's lucky she wasn't wearing a white scarf, but the scarf in Evidence 5 is blue. But that's a different contradiction. The main motive contradiction here is Testimony 3 (no motive) vs. her real identity as Dahlia, which would be tied to the Diamond. So the Diamond (8) contradicts her statement of having no reason (Testimony 3). Therefore, the answer would be evidence 8 and testimony 3."

Mia: Did anything strange happen when he did that? Melissa: Well, I don't know if you'd call it strange or not... ...but that's when the victim's scarf fell off. Judge: Hmm... You mean this scarf!? Edgeworth: Her words match what we found at the scene. I don't see any problem...Melissa: I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.Press Mia: Mia: You mean the defendant carried the body all by himself? Melissa: Y-Yes... Edgeworth: Considering the size of the defendant, I don't think it would be difficult. Mia: Yes, but... Let's remember they were on a narrow bridge that was ready to collapse! Is it even possible for him to have carried a dead body on a bridge like that...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, the fact of the matter is that he DID! That kind of talk is just silly! Mia: (Wow... Why did he get so emotional all of a sudden?) Judge: Ms. Fey, if you think there's some other possibility, please share it with the rest of us.Present Dusky Bridge Map Mia: Mia: A killer not wanting his victim to be found... I can understand that. However! The idea of moving the body for that purpose is clearly odd. There was a much easier way to make sure the body wasn't found! Edgeworth: ... Judge: W-Well? What is it!? Mia: Take another look at the map of the area and you'll see how. There's a river right below the bridge. Earlier Mr. Edgeworth pointed out something interesting about the river. Edgeworth: For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered... Judge: Ahh...

None of your arguments have anything to do with what the witness saw. Judge: Hmm... Quite true... Ms. Fey, it seems that your assertion is without merit after all.

Melissa: Well... Naturally, he got in the car and was about to flee. That's... That's when I came to my senses.

It's already a broken-down bridge hidden away in the mountains. Doing anything more to hide the corpse would be going overboard, wouldn't it? Melissa: Yes, but that mountain is famous among hikers. A surprising number of people go up there. Mia: But it's February, right? And it was raining that day, correct? Melissa: There is also a small temple and a channeling dojo there. You know those monks... They just love cold, isolated places... Edgeworth: I think the witness is trying to say that the corpse could have been found at any time... Besides, the witness is merely reporting what she witnessed with her own eyes. Melissa: ...Melissa: Oh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.Press Mia: Mia: And you're absolutely certain that it was my client who was carrying the body? Melissa: ... Well, he was wearing a prisoner's uniform, but... as for his face... Judge: So you're saying you didn't get a clear look at his face? Melissa: Well, they were far away and it was raining as well. I-I thought I was only supposed to say exactly what I saw... Judge: Excellent! You're a remarkably honest young woman!Mia: (Something about this testimony is bothering me, but what...?)Armando: Hey, Kitten... Have you ever put salt in your coffee?Mia: No... Why would I!?Armando: Why not?Mia: Huh...?Armando: It may actually go better with coffee than sugar, right?Mia: ...Armando: Listen. My point is if you're not sure, you might as well add a ton of salt to it. It might... bring out the rust in something. Like a piece of evidence.Mia: (He's right, Mia... Go present something. You've got nothing to lose!)Armando: By the way, I wouldn't put salt in my coffee.

Edgeworth: My point is that no matter how odd you may find the killer's method of body-disposal... ...the fact is that this is what the killer did. None of your arguments have anything to do with what the witness saw. Judge: Hmm... Quite true... Ms. Fey, it seems that your assertion is without merit after all. Mia: Mia: But what the witness claims to have seen is totally ridiculous... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Surely you can't deny that the body was found in the trunk of the car. Judge: That's certainly consistent with what the witness has told us. Mia: Ugh... Edgeworth: Please, witness, go on with your testimony. Melissa: I-I'll try... Edgeworth: All you have to do is tell us only what you saw. Otherwise the mean lady might yell at you again. Mia: (Who is he talking about!?) Melissa: Alright! I-I'll do my best! Changes statement from \"I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.\" to \"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\"Melissa: The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.Press Mia: Mia: What did the man do then? Melissa: Well... Naturally, he got in the car and was about to flee. That's... That's when I came to my senses. I said to myself, \"You have to call the police!\" Edgeworth: And so that's when you called the police? Mia: You're sure that you saw all that with your own eyes? Melissa: Yes. I'm 100% certain.Present Dusky Bridge Map or Witness's Photo Mia: Leads to: \"Well, Ms. Foster... It looks like you've done it this time.\"Melissa: He couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge.Press Mia: Mia: Why do you say that? It's already a broken-down bridge hidden away in the mountains. Doing anything more to hide the corpse would be going overboard, wouldn't it? Melissa: Yes, but that mountain is famous among hikers. A surprising number of people go up there. Mia: But it's February, right? And it was raining that day, correct? Melissa: There is also a small temple and a channeling dojo there. You know those monks... They just love cold, isolated places... Edgeworth: I think the witness is trying to say that the corpse could have been found at any time... Besides, the witness is merely reporting what she witnessed with her own eyes. Melissa: ...Melissa: Oh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.Press Mia: Mia: And you're absolutely certain that it was my client who was carrying the body? Melissa: ... Well, he was wearing a prisoner's uniform, but... as for his face... Judge: So you're saying you didn't get a clear look at his face? Melissa: Well, they were far away and it was raining as well. I-I thought I was only supposed to say exactly what I saw... Judge: Excellent! You're a remarkably honest young woman!Mia: (Something about this testimony is bothering me, but what...?)Armando: Hey, Kitten... Have you ever put salt in your coffee?Mia: No... Why would I!?Armando: Why not?Mia: Huh...?Armando: It may actually go better with coffee than sugar, right?Mia: ...Armando: Listen. My point is if you're not sure, you might as well add a ton of salt to it. It might... bring out the rust in something. Like a piece of evidence.Mia: (He's right, Mia... Go present something. You've got nothing to lose!)Armando: By the way, I wouldn't put salt in my coffee. The two don't go well, after all.Mia: Well, Ms. Foster... It looks like you've done it this time.Melissa: ...? D-Done what?Mia: Made a crucial mistake.Judge: A c-crucial mistake? Like what, Ms. Fey!?Mia: \"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\" You're saying you saw that, right? With your very own eyes?Melissa: Y-Yes... And...?Mia: It's simple, Ms. Foster. Take a look at the diagram. The place you claim to have taken the photo from that day is here. Do you see what I mean? Even if you tried to see the car... ...this outcropping of rock is directly in the way.Melissa: Ah...!Mia: That's right, Ms. Foster. From where you were standing, you could not have possibly seen the killer's car.Melissa: Aaaaah...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I admit that the diagram shows a large outcropping of rock. However... It isn't so tall that it would stop her from seeing the car!Melissa: Th-That's right! It-It's not high at all... I-I was able to see his car just fine!Mia: I'm so sorry... But that just doesn't wash.Melissa: ...!Mia: I believe it was the witness who presented this as evidence to the court, yes? This is the location that the photo was taken from. Your own photo tells the whole story! You can clearly see the left side of the bridge... But the outcropping that is being referred to is really more like a cliff.Judge: Ah!Mia: Your view should have been completely cut off by this cliff! But still you claim to have been able to see the killer's car!Melissa: ... Noooooo!Judge: Or-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of all this ballyhoo...!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Your Honor... Don't jump to any hasty conclusions. The fact that the escapee fled in a stolen car was reported on the news. After witnessing a murder, I'm sure you can appreciate that the witness was very upset. She must have heard about the stolen car and convinced herself that she saw it.Mia:Mia: But she was repeatedly warned before starting her testimony! She was told to testify only about what she saw with her own eyes!Judge: Hmmmmm... Oh!Melissa: Err... Mr. Judge?Judge: Wh-What is it?Melissa: I think... I think I must have remembered things wrong...Mia:Mia: Hey! Wait a minute! You can't just say that...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Ms. Fey, no one on the face of the planet is perfect.Judge: Hmmmm... Yes, indeed... Quite true! You know what they say... \"To err is human, to forgive, divine.\" I'm inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to our witness here.Mia: What...!? Th-That's not fair...!Armando: Ha...! Save the tears for later, Kitten!Mia: M-Mr. Armando!Armando: Don't look back until the trial is over. Now is the time to go forward.Mia: B-But...! But that wasn't fair!Armando: OK, Kitten, you need to relax. Then you need to remember... The other kitten's testimony!Melissa: The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.Armando: So tell me... How did she know that? (Changed from [So tell us... How did you know that?] in the original release) How did she know that he broke into the trunk? (Changed from [How did you know that he broke into the trunk?] in the original release)Mia: Aha...!Armando: Well, Ms. Foster? Until you can explain how you knew that... (Changed from [Until you can explain how you knew that...] in the original release) ...you're going to have a lot of very suspicious people on this side of the courtroom.Melissa: ...Judge: W-Well, witness?Melissa: Well, I'm certain that he broke into the trunk. Because... Because there were marks left on the trunk lid. I'm certain they were scratch marks from when he broke into it...!Judge: W-What...!? L-Let me see that photo! It's true... These certainly look like scratch marks around the keyhole! HMMMM...! It's obvious that this trunk has been broken open. Well, Ms. Fey? Are you satisfied...?Mia: (The judge is on her side! I can't make any mistakes here! What she just said... Is there a contradiction in there somewhere...?)I'll buy it Mia: (Something about it still doesn't feel right, but...) I, err... OK, I guess I'm satisfied... Sort of. Edgeworth: I hope this has cleared up any doubts... Judge: Indeed, I believe it has. Armando: Hey Kitten, this is no time to play around! Mia: Huh...? Armando: Overlooking such a huge contradiction... What am I going do with you? Mia: (Contradiction...!? So that wasn't my imagination after all!) Judge: Very well, let's move on to the next... Mia: Mia: J-Just a minute! Judge: What is it now, Ms. Fey!? Mia: I've got a big problem with what this witness said! Judge: ... I'd appreciate it if you didn't change your mind every 5 seconds! Mia: (Ugh... Hang in there, Mia!) Leads to: \"Melissa Foster.\"It doesn't work. Leads to: \"Melissa Foster.\"Mia: Melissa Foster. It looks like you've finally betrayed yourself.Melissa: What...!?Mia: You said you were in a field taking photos of wild flowers. But even so, you knew about the scratches... The question is when! When did you get a chance to see those scratches!?Melissa: ...Mia: (Finally...! I've finally got her!)Armando: Ha...! I'm getting pretty tired of waiting over here!Edgeworth: Then perhaps it would be faster if Ms. Fey explained herself.Mia: Your Honor! There's only one possible explanation! The reason the witness had seen the scratches was...she happened to be passing by. Mia: Because she just happened to be passing by the area where the car was parked! Judge: ... Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Frankly, Your Honor, after hearing a pathetic response like that... I have to question whether or not such a pathetic lawyer should even exist... Judge: Did you hear that Ms. Fey? I believe Mr. Edgeworth just called you a canucklehead. Mia: (Yeesh, isn't that overdoing things a little bit...? Come on, Mia! One more time! You can do it!) Leads back to: \"Your Honor! There's only one possible explanation!\"she put the corpse in herself. Leads to: \"There's only one way that the witness had the chance to see those scratches.\"she is the owner of the car. Mia: Because the stolen car actually belonged to her. That is why she knew about the scratches! Judge: ... Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Frankly, Your Honor, after hearing a pathetic response like that... I have to question whether or not such a pathetic lawyer should even exist... Judge: Did you hear that Ms. Fey? I believe Mr. Edgeworth just called you a canucklehead. Mia: (Yeesh, isn't that overdoing things a little bit...? Come on, Mia! One more time! You can do it!) Leads back to: \"Your Honor! There's only one possible explanation!\"Mia: There's only one way that the witness had the chance to see those scratches.Judge: Y-Yes? What was it?Mia: Naturally... When she opened the trunk... and stuffed the corpse in herself!Edgeworth: ...!Mia: The person who really hid the body in the trunk of that car was... Melissa Foster! It was you that did it, wasn't it!?Melissa: Th-That's ridiculous! I could never...! It was the man in the prison garb! He-He's the one that...Mia: I don't think so, Ms. Foster. If Mr. Fawles had been the one that put the corpse in the trunk... ...he would have simply used the car key. There was no need to break it open.Melissa: B-But...! He stole the car...!Mia: He stole it from a young couple that had been waiting at a red light. Which means that the key would have still been in the ignition.Melissa: Oh...! I-I... I see...Mia: Thank you for telling us about the scratches, Ms. Foster. Without that, we never would have uncovered the truth. That it couldn't have been Mr. Fawles that put the body in the trunk! (Changed from [It couldn't have been Mr. Fawles that put the body in the trunk!] in the original release)Melissa: Nooooo!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: P-Preposterous! To even suggest that the witness put the body in there! If that were true... then how do you explain the photo that she took? The corpse could only have been put in the trunk when the incident occurred. And we already know that at the time, she was taking photographs!Mia: (Now is your chance, Mia! Finish this thing!) On the contrary, I'm not so certain about that anymore, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth: ...!Mia: There's no need to think too deeply about it. What I'm saying is the shutter for this may not have been pushed by Ms. Foster herself!Present Camera Mia: Leads to: \"Let's take another look at this camera, and see what features it has, shall we?\"Present anything else Mia: Mia: Well, Your Honor? Judge: To be quite honest, Ms. Fey... I wish you would have thought a little more deeply on this matter. Mia: Huh? Armando: Hey Kitten... Don't start getting all sloppy on me now. The fact is, she wasn't there, but the photo got taken. So how did it happen? This is a fastball right over home plate. Mia: (That's what I thought, but...) Judge: Ms. Fey, take a moment and think it over again. Leads back to: \"There's no need to think too deeply about it.\"Mia: Let's take another look at this camera, and see what features it has, shall we? (Changed from [I don't think you can make a mistake about it. Take a look at her camera.] in the original release) It has a timer built into it! Even a mini-tripod!Judge: Hmmmm...!Mia: Almost as if the camera was brought just to take this picture!Melissa: ...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: What are you trying to say then, Ms. Fey!? That when the crime occurred, Ms. Foster wasn't in the field as she claimed!?Mia: (Well, if she really did use the camera's auto-timer... ...then the answer is yes, she was somewhere else.) Exactly. She was NOT in the field.Judge: Hmm... Would the defense please explain further.Armando: Listen... This is a crucial point. \"Where was Ms. Foster when the incident occurred...?\" In answering that question, we'll also make clear Ms. Foster's true identity.Judge: Well then, please answer this question. Where was Melissa Foster when the incident on the bridge occurred?Present victim's location Mia: Leads to: \"Naturally, the witness was right here!\"Present car Mia: Mia: Naturally the witness was right... here! ...I think. Judge: Hmm... In the spot where the defendant's car was? Mia: Yes! She had to put the body in the trunk before the defendant returned! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You don't mind if I ask one teenie-weenie question, do you, Ms. Fey...? Mia: (Uh oh. He's got that condescending tone in his voice...) Edgeworth: If she put the body in the trunk at that time, as you suggest... ...that must mean that Valerie Hawthorne was already dead at that point, correct? Judge: Hmm, indeed. Edgeworth: Please take a look at the top of Dusky Bridge. It certainly looks to me like the victim is still alive... Am I mistaken? Mia: Err... Edgeworth: If Valerie Hawthorne was already dead, then... who is this? The mountain is famous for spirits, so maybe you think it was the ghost of the victim? Mia: ... Well, it COULD have been a spirit... Right? Judge: Ms. Fey! Don't waste the court's time with this kind of foolishness! Mia: A-Anyway! I still maintain that the witness was in a different place at the time! Judge: Are you certain? Mia: Yes, I am certain! More or less. Judge: Oh, come now, Ms. Fey... Leads back to: \"Well then, please answer this question.\"Present anywhere else Mia: Mia: Naturally, the witness was standing right here! Judge: Hmmmmm... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: *sigh* Before pointing out where the witness was standing, Ms. Fey should do something herself. She should figure out where SHE stands, if you catch my drift! Mia: (Oh don't worry, the drift was certainly caught...) Judge: Yes, failure is an excellent opportunity for growth. Now try better next time. Mia: Ah, yes... Thank you... Leads back to: \"Well then, please answer this question.\"Mia: Naturally, the witness was right here!Judge: B-But that's... But that's where the victim, Ms. Hawthorne was standing! Order! Order! Order! Ms. Fey! What on earth...!?Mia: Your Honor, if I may... After parting with the \"victim\" on the bridge, the defendant fled by car. But this would mean that there was no time to put the victim in the trunk. In other words, if someone put the body in the trunk... ...it could only have been before the defendant met the \"victim\"!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: How asinine! Of course Mr. Fawles met with the victim! The only person with the opportunity to have put the victim in the trunk... ...is the same man that killed her: Terry Fawles!Mia:Mia: You still don't understand, do you, Mr. Edgeworth? By the time the witness's photo was taken, the victim was already dead... The person in the photo was NOT Valerie Hawthorne!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: What!? I've never heard anything more ridiculous in my entire life! Then who exactly is the \"victim\" in this photo!?Mia: It's obvious, isn't it? It's your own witness.Melissa: ...!Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaaat...!?Mia: It's the only possible explanation. The woman that Mr. Fawles met on the bridge that day was not Valerie Hawthorne! It was you! Melissa Foster!Melissa: M-M-Me...!?Mia: Let's remember that it was raining and foggy on the mountain that day. Mr. Fawles himself believed that the woman in front of him was Valerie Hawthorne!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: But the defendant knew Valerie Hawthorne very well! After all, she was the woman whose testimony helped get him convicted!Mia:Mia: But since then, my client has spent five hard years in a federal penitentiary! He couldn't remember exactly what she looked like anymore!Edgeworth: You are just making this up as you go along! Where's your proof!?Mia: (I've got it all right here! This piece of evidence will blow this case wide open...!) At the time of the incident, Mr. Fawles had forgotten what Valerie Hawthorne looked like!Present Victim's Note or Scarf Mia: Leads to: \"Mr. Fawles had forgotten the victim's face.\"Present anything else Mia: Armando: Wait a minute, Kitten. Mia: M-Mr. Armando... Armando: First of all, relax. Second of all, think the whole thing over again! Mia: (H-He's right, Mia! You need to calm down and think it over!) Leads back to: \"He couldn't remember exactly what she looked like anymore!\"Mia: Mr. Fawles had forgotten the victim's face. That's why he needed some piece of identification. Namely, this muddy scarf!Melissa: Ah...!Mia: It was Mr. Fawles who requested that she wear this scarf to identify herself. That's already been proven by the note the victim left!Edgeworth: ...Mia: In other words, as long as you were wearing a scarf like he asked... ...anyone could have pretended to be Valerie Hawthorne!Melissa: ...Mia: Well? What do you have to say to that, Melissa Foster!?Melissa: Nnng...Gggh...Unnn...! N-N-N-N-N-Nnnnoooooooo!!!Judge: Err... Ahh... Where's Ms. Foster...?Edgeworth: She's collecting herself in the Lobby.Judge: Hmmmmm...Mia: (It's obvious that Melissa Foster did it. She hid the body in the trunk and disguised herself as the victim... She set up the camera to snap a fake photo of them together...)Armando: The only question is... why did she do it...?Mia: Well, isn't that obvious? She's the real culprit! (Changed from [She's the true criminal!] in the original release)Armando: Ha...!Judge: Well, we'll have to wait for Ms. Foster to compose herself before we start again. Until then, this court is in recess. The defense and the prosecution are both to wait in their respective lobbies. (Changed from [The defense and the prosecution are instructed to wait in the lobby.] in the original release)Mia: Yes, Your Honor.Edgeworth: Understood.Judge: Very well! This court is in recess!To be continued.February 16, 1:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4Mia: Mr. Fawles, I...Fawles: UGGAAAA!Mia: Eeeeeek! I'm sorry! I-I'm sorry!Fawles: I wanna say thanks. You're real good! You really hooked me up!Mia: Thanks! We're almost there! Once I prove that she committed the crime...Armando: ...Yeah, but there's one more big obstacle we've got to get past.Mia: Ob-Obstacle...?Armando: Yeah. Motive. Why would Melissa Foster kill that policewoman anyway?Mia: (Motive, huh...)Armando: Anyway... We're still badly in need of information.Mia: Information... Right...Armando: What we need the most is info about this Melissa Foster herself. All we know is that she's a student studying literature. And one more thing.Mia: ...What is it?Armando: Well, the incident that happened 5 years ago, of course. The kidnapping-murder case that Zebra Boy is on death row for...Fawles: I din't do nuttin'! I din't kill nobody! I never lie!Mia: Mr. Fawles! In that case... Tell us more about it. ...About what happened 5 years ago.Fawles: ... OK. I trust you. That day. 5 years ago. I dream of it. Every day. This picture. It reminds me everything. Bridge looks same. Just like then... 5 years ago... Like it could fall apart... Fall apart any minute...Mia: (So it's been broken like that for at least 5 years...)Armando: Ha...! Sorry buddy, but you sound like the one that could fall apart at any minute.Fawles: It true. I did... ...I did kidnap her. ...Five years ago. I kidnapped. My girlfriend. Dahlia Hawthorne.Mia: Y-Your g-girlfriend? Huh...?Armando: Hey, hold on there! Did you say, \"Hawthorne\"!?Mia: (The victim's last name...!)Fawles: Dahlia Hawthorne... Valerie's little sister.Mia: Wh-Wh-Whaaat!? Are you serious!?The girl... Let her go!Shut up! C-Come closer... And I kill her!Sorry, but you're not going to get the chance...Mia: (The detective back then was Valerie Hawthorne!) At first I thought shooting someone for a kidnapping was crossing the line, but... If it was to protect her little sister, I can understand why she did it...Fawles: Wrong! No protect sister! Valerie betray me! Betray us!Mia: What do you mean she betrayed you!?Fawles: Everything. All lies. All make-believe. Kidnapping, too...Mia: A make-believe kidnapping?Fawles: Dahlia. My girlfriend. My love. My Teen Angel.Mia: (Ugh. Did he actually say, \"My Teen Angel\"? He's seen one too many soap operas.)Fawles: I do anything she says. Anything Dahlia says...Mia: (\"Anything Dahlia says\"...?) H-Hold on a minute! What you're saying is that the kidnapping 5 years ago was planned by...Fawles: Yeah. Me and Dahlia... ...And Valerie, too.Mia: (Valerie was in on it!?)Fawles: Dahlia's family rich. Jewelry business. We get one jewel... That's what we thought... Me and Dahlia wrote kidnap note. We send to her dad. Asked for 2 million dollar diamond. Tell him make exchange on Dusky Bridge. ...We tell him Valerie make transfer 'cause she new detective.Armando: Having a police detective in your pocket is a useful thing alright. In the end, you were planning on splitting the 2 million three ways, huh...Fawles: Yeah, but! That woman! That woman! Valerie! She do it for real! She shoot at me for real! Me and Dahlia!*BANG!*Fawles: I was shot in arm. Dahlia... She jump in river.Mia: Jump...? You don't mean she jumped on purpose, do you?Fawles: I couldn't do it! I could never push her...! Anyway, I blacked out... Wake up with police all over.Armando: ...And that's when they decided to give you the death sentence.Fawles: I couldn't believe it. That woman. She betrayed me.Valerie: That man... Terry Fawles... He killed her! He threw her off the bridge! He threw my beloved sister into the roaring river 40 feet below!Fawles: ...These 5 years... All I wonder is... Why! ...Why! ...Why! ...Why! Why did she lie!? That's all I want to know!Armando: So that's why you called her. You wanted to hear the truth from Valerie herself.Fawles: Yes... but I forget what she look like. So I tell her to wear scarf. I don't want to hurt her! ...Just ask why! Why! Why did you lie...? Why did you betray me...? I just want to hear answer come from her mouth. That's all!Mia: (So that's why... That's why you made a crazy escape like that...)Armando: Just one thing, Zebra Boy... My senses are tingling all over. Tell me, Mr. Fawles... Where is it?Mia: ...Huh? Where's what?Armando: Come on now, Kitten... The ransom. The 2 million dollar diamond. Remember that now? Did you give it back to Pops? Did the police take it?Fawles: ...I dunno.Mia: Huh? You don't know?Fawles: No really. I dunno. It's gone. With Dahlia.Mia: ...With Dahlia?Fawles: That day. On the bridge... Dahlia put it. In backpack... Now gone. With Dahlia. Gone... Forever... Into Eagle River...Mia: (It disappeared with Dahlia, huh...? Wait a minute...!)Bailiff: ...You can come back in now! We're about ready to go!Mia: Mr. Fawles! Just one more question! When you said, \"with Dahlia\", do you mean the diamond is still missing...? Along with the body of Dahlia Hawthorne?Fawles: ... Never found her... My sweet Dahlia...Mia: (They never found her...!)Fawles: Swallowed by river... Gone... Dahlia... My Teen Angel...Armando: Your \"Teen Angel\"...? How old was she anyway?Fawles: Just 14...Mia: F-F-Fourteen!? (I guess you were robbing cradles before diamonds...)Armando: She plans a fake kidnapping and disappears into the river with a rock worth 2 mil... Man oh man... Angels these days.Mia: (Fawles takes the fall... And gets a one-way ticket to Death Row... Is Dahlia Hawthorne an angel or is she really a...)Armando: ...It's time, Kitten. It looks like we have a few more aces up our sleeve now.Mia: ...You bet!Diamond added to the Court Record.Armando: The training wheels come off now, Mia! You've got to strike while the iron is hot! That's one of my rules. Remember it.February 16, 1:49 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: Now then, let's continue with the trial of Mr. Terry Fawles. ...Witness. Are you feeling better?Melissa: Y-Yes, Your Honor... I-I'll try my best.Judge: Hmm... You're a brave young lady.Mia: (Not this again...)Edgeworth: I can understand a defense lawyer wanting to get her client off the hook... However! To try to pin the crime on an innocent student is...Mia: What are you talking about!?Edgeworth: My witness is not the person on trial here. She's an innocent bystander who witnessed a violent crime. ...That's all. What possible reason would a girl like this have for murdering a policewoman!Judge: Hmm... It's certainly hard to imagine this woman as a murderer...Mia: (Her motive, huh... I figured that's what I had to establish next...)Judge: Well, Ms. Fey? Do you have any evidence of a motive?Mia: ... Err, yes! Of course! ...I think.Armando: Hah...! You're still acting as tame as a kitten... Kitten.Mia: Mr. Armando...Armando: Listen... A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets.Mia: ...!Armando: Smiling on the outside while your guts are twisted in knots is the mark of a pro.Mia: ...Maybe so, but I wish you would quit grinning at me like that.Melissa: Umm... Excuse me... May I speak, Mr. Judge?Judge: Of course! Mr. Judge is ready anytime you like!Melissa: I'd like... I'd like to say something. Some people here are suspicious of me, right? Th-That's why... I... I at least wanted you, Mr. Judge, to know that it's not true...Judge: Hmmmmm! I see! You're such an honest and upstanding young lady.Armando: It looks like this witness is a real professional.Mia: Wh-What do you mean!?Armando: Look at that 100-watt smile. ...Just when things are darkest for her... CLICK. She lights right up!Judge: Very well then! Let's hear what the witness has to say!Witness Testimony-- Melissa Foster's History --Melissa: I... I was out of the country until the year before last. Until I entered college, I had never even been to Eagle Mountain before... And I certainly don't have any reason for wanting to hurt a police officer. Holding a grudge and killing the officer who testified against you 5 years ago... Or kidnapping a poor girl... I just think the defendant is a terrible, horrible monster!Judge: Hmm... Out of the country, eh...Edgeworth: Precisely. Furthermore, she has no possible motive for committing murder.Judge: Hmm, indeed...Armando: You're up to bat, Kitten. Sharpen those claws and put on your best smile.Mia: Y-You bet! (Somehow, I have to tie her to this case...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Melissa Foster's History --Melissa: I... I was out of the country until the year before last.Press Mia: Mia: So, what country were you living in then? Melissa: We were all living abroad, but after my parents were killed... Edgeworth: It was a brutal civil war. She had to try to make her way back home alone... Melissa: I lost everything... I didn't even have any personal identification... Mia: (What kind of sob story is this...? ...What do I do? Should I press her for details?) Wait and see Mia: (There's nothing I can do about her claim to have lost all her identification. All I can do is wait to find some other evidence about her real identity.) Judge: Very well then, Ms. Foster. Please proceed. Leads back to cross-examination Press her harder Mia: ...Witness. Answer my question. I'll even repeat it for you. What country were you in? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this line of questioning is childish. What country she was in and how many languages she may speak are irrelevant here. What we're here to evaluate is whether this witness has any connection to this case. Melissa: I've lived abroad ever since I was a little girl... That's why I could never have known Mr. Fawles or Detective Hawthorne. Edgeworth: Yes... I think we've established that point. Judge: Yes, indeed. Well then. Shall we add what you've just stated to the official testimony? Melissa: Yes, please. ...Mr. Judge. Adds statement \"Naturally, I didn't know either the victim or the defendant.\"Press (after adding statement \"Naturally, I didn't know either the victim or the defendant.\") Mia: Mia: So, what country were you living in then? Melissa: We were all living abroad, but after my parents were killed... Edgeworth: It was a brutal civil war. She had to try to make her way back home alone... Melissa: I lost everything... I didn't even have any personal identification... Mia: (What kind of sob story is this...?)Melissa: Naturally, I didn't know either the victim or the defendant.Press Mia: Mia: You didn't know either person? Are you certain of that? Melissa: Yes. I'm afraid I'm rather shy around people. Judge: Hmm... Oh well, that can't be helped. Mia: (Why is he just agreeing with everything that comes out of her mouth...?) Judge: The first time you saw either of them was when they were on the bridge, correct? Melissa: Yes... It really was a coincidence.Melissa: Until I entered college, I had never even been to Eagle Mountain before...Press Mia: Mia: So what made you decide to go to Eagle Mountain anyway? Melissa: I just love being outdoors... Picnics, hiking... You know, that sort of thing. Mia: (...You don't look like much of a hiker to me. But you do look like a digger of sorts.) But Eagle Mountain is a two-hour drive from here and no trains run through there. There are plenty of mountains that are closer and easier to get to. Melissa: Well, I went there once with the college Hiking Club. I fell in love with its stark, desolate beauty and its cold, yet romantic, gloominess... Mia: (Didn't know you were such a goth...) By the way, what's the name of your college...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The prosecution objects to any questions that involve the witness's private life. Mia: ...! Edgeworth: All that matters is that she is a material witness to a crime. The witness doesn't need to respond to questions that are clearly malicious in intent. Melissa: Thank you! She's really gone too far...! Judge: Hmmmmm! Ms. Fey! You're treading on thin ice here! Mia: (I hardly said anything! Talk about sensitive...)Melissa: And I certainly don't have any reason for wanting to hurt a police officer.Press Mia: Mia: Perhaps, but your behavior that day was very suspicious! Not only have you contradicted yourself here in court, but you know things you shouldn't. For example, the scratches on the trunk of the car. Melissa: Well th-that's... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately Ms. Fey, your last statement proves nothing. Mia: Oh really!? And why is that? Edgeworth: The witness came to the police station once to identify the suspect. It's entirely possible that, at that time, an officer showed her this photo. Judge: Hmm... That seems like a rather serious mistake. Armando: Ha...! That's the oldest trick in the prosecutor's book. Mia: Th-That's not fair...! Melissa: That wicked inmate... I'll never be able to forget that horrible day...Melissa: Holding a grudge and killing the officer who testified against you 5 years ago...Press Mia: Mia: A grudge...? Melissa: Well, the policewoman's testimony was crucial, wasn't it? ...Crucial in getting the defendant sentenced to death. Edgeworth: Yes, and that's precisely why he harbored such deep anger against her. So much anger that he forgot his own guilt... Mia: Mia: My client has always maintained that he's innocent of those charges! Melissa: He seems rather forgetful. ...Your client, I mean. Mia: ...! Melissa: Not only did he forget about what he did, but he forgot the poor policewoman as well. Mia: What do you mean by that? Melissa: Your client... He forgot what the detective looked like, right? It's too bad for her that he didn't forget about her testimony as well. Mia: (Well, she's right about that. Mr. Fawles is kind of forgetful...) Wait and see Mia: (Any more damage to my client's image could be a disaster... The judge already has a bad enough opinion of him...) Judge: You just can't trust someone with a bad memory. What did you eat for dinner one week ago today? ...At the very least, a person should remember that much. As for me, it was payday, so I had a nice moose steak with some poutine on the side. Mia: (...And how does this relate to anything!?) Edgeworth: Whether it's eating steak or committing murder, a person shouldn't deny their actions. I'm in complete agreement, Your Honor. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Mia: You said, \"he forgot what the detective looked like.\" What did you mean by that? Melissa: Well he couldn't tell who she was without some kind of identification, right? Edgeworth: Quite right... That's why the victim was wearing a scarf as identification. Melissa: Why, if I had been wearing a white scarf that day... ...then he probably would have tried to kill me... Judge: Hmm... That's true. He's clearly a bitter man! Mia: (This is bad. Mr. Fawles's reputation just keeps getting worse and worse. Sometimes it's best not to poke too deep... What should I do with that last statement?) Have it added to the testimony Mia: Your Honor! What the witness said just now was tremendously important! I'd like it added to the official testimony! Edgeworth: The prosecution has no objection... After all, the defendant is a killer and a mentally unbalanced one at that... That testimony only helps to further prove that point... Judge: Hmm...! Mia: N-No, that's not why I... Judge: Enough. ...Witness, if you would? Melissa: My pleasure, Mr. Judge. Adds statement \"I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.\" Leave it alone Mia: (Any more damage to my client's image could be a disaster...

Melissa: Well... It's February now. Everyone is wearing scarves. If I had accidentally worn a white scarf like he said... Edgeworth: Then you yourself might have been killed. Judge: Hmmmmm... That would've been a terrible loss for this world! Armando: Ha...! It looks like you pressed too hard this time, Kitten. Mia: Mr. Armando... Armando: Keep looking around you and you're going to lose sight of the finish line. Justice is blind, but she's not deaf. Sometimes you have to know when not to talk.Present Scarf Mia: Mia: Witness... I want you to look at this photo you took. It's hard to see in the photo, but look at the scarf the victim wore as identification. Judge: Ah, you are talking about this scarf right here, eh? Melissa: Y-Yes! That's it! The scarf the policewoman was wearing... Mia: (I've got her now, just don't mess up...) ...But that's strange. In your testimony, you stated the following... \"I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.\" Judge: Wh-White? Mia: ...This is the scarf you identified as belonging to the victim. But it certainly doesn't look white to me! Melissa: Oh...! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, it was foggy that day... And it was raining as well! It's not surprising that she mistook it for white! Mia: Mia: Sorry, but not this time. The witness just confirmed that this was the victim's scarf! Judge: Yes, but... What's the significance...? It's true that the scarf doesn't look white, but...

That's your definitive piece of evidence? Mia: Yes! ...If my thinking is correct. Edgeworth: Well then. We have one mystery solved! The answer is simple. Ms. Fey's thinking is wrong. ...That's all there is to it. Mia: Huh? Armando: Please, Kitten. You've got to do something... You're killing me over here. Judge: Ms. Fey, I've got a definitive penalty to reward you for your definitive piece of evidence. Mia: (Well, that wasn't what I was expecting...) Judge: Well... Do you have evidence or not? Perhaps you can tell us about why the witness thought the scarf was white, eh... Leads back to: \"There's only one explanation for this mix-up!\" Mia: ...Witness. Have you ever seen this note? Melissa: N-Note...? I, err... No, never... Judge: It's top-secret evidence. There's no reason that you would have. Mia: Hmm, I wonder about that... Melissa: Wh-What do you mean...? Mia: This note shows Mr. Fawles's instructions to the victim regarding their meeting. It says... \"Wear white scarf for identification.\" Edgeworth: White... Scarf...? AAAAAAH!!! Mia: Witness! You KNEW what this note said! And it's because you knew, that you slipped up and mistakenly said \"white scarf\"!

Mr. Fawles did give instructions to Valerie Hawthorne about their meeting. The note that she left said: \"Wear white scarf for identification.\" Judge: Yes, what about it...? Mia: Isn't it obvious!? Doesn't it strike you as odd!? That note was a secret piece of evidence! How is it that the witness knows about it!? Melissa: Ah...! Judge: Order! Order! Hmm... It is odd, isn't it? Well, Mr. Edgeworth!? Did you show top-secret evidence to the witness...? Edgeworth: Y-Your Honor... I certainly never gave anyone permission to do such a thing. Mia: In that case, the only way the witness could know about the note would b-- Melissa: J-Just a moment! Of course... Of course I didn't know about the note! It's just... I saw it when it happened. ...With my own eyes. When the victim went to see the killer... She used her own scarf to signal him. That's why... That's why I assumed that the signal was a white scarf.

Edgeworth: It was a brutal civil war. She had to try to make her way back home alone... Melissa: I lost everything... I didn't even have any personal identification... Mia: (What kind of sob story is this...? ...What do I do? Should I press her for details?) Wait and see Mia: (There's nothing I can do about her claim to have lost all her identification. All I can do is wait to find some other evidence about her real identity.) Judge: Very well then, Ms. Foster. Please proceed. Leads back to cross-examination Press her harder Mia: ...Witness. Answer my question. I'll even repeat it for you. What country were you in? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this line of questioning is childish. What country she was in and how many languages she may speak are irrelevant here. What we're here to evaluate is whether this witness has any connection to this case. Melissa: I've lived abroad ever since I was a little girl... That's why I could never have known Mr. Fawles or Detective Hawthorne. Edgeworth: Yes... I think we've established that point. Judge: Yes, indeed. Well then. Shall we add what you've just stated to the official testimony? Melissa: Yes, please. ...Mr. Judge.

Judge: The first time you saw either of them was when they were on the bridge, correct? Melissa: Yes... It really was a coincidence.Melissa: Until I entered college, I had never even been to Eagle Mountain before...Press Mia: Mia: So what made you decide to go to Eagle Mountain anyway? Melissa: I just love being outdoors... Picnics, hiking... You know, that sort of thing. Mia: (...You don't look like much of a hiker to me. But you do look like a digger of sorts.)

Her corpse was never found!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: She was declared legally dead 5 years ago! As far as the law is concerned, Dahlia Hawthorne is officially dead.Mia:Mia: But the fact remains that her body was never recovered! Dahlia Hawthorne was 14 years old, 5 years ago.

You don't have to say anymore, witness.Melissa: ... Yes. I understand.Judge: Wh-What! Mr. Edgeworth! Explain yourself!Edgeworth: Your Honor. I have an admission to make. I honestly never thought the defense would pursue the matter this far...Judge: You don't...! You don't mean...!Edgeworth: ...Yes. The prosecutor's office isn't filled with fools, you know. Naturally, we conduct full background checks on all of our witnesses.Mia: Wh-What did he say...?Armando: Ha...! It looks like the kid knew. He knew her true identity from the get-go.Mia: No way...! But then why...!Armando: If you hadn't revealed her secret, he wasn't going to say anything about it. All he wanted was her testimony, so he made a little trade.Edgeworth: Let me introduce you to... ...the victim's younger sister, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge: But... But... I thought she died 5 years ago...?Edgeworth: We thought so as well... But... Well, as you can see...Mia: Why!? Why did she hide her identity for 5 years!?Edgeworth: That has nothing to do with the current case. She was merely an accidental witness to a crime...Mia:Mia: Accidental...? I don't believe that for a minute! For the last 5 years, she's been playing the role of victim! And now we find her acting suspiciously at another murder scene!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Really, Ms. Fey! I must say, your strategy here is painfully obvious. (Changed from [...Really, Ms. Fey! Your strategy is clearly obvious.] in the original release) You're trying to pin your client's crime on an innocent witness in order to win... ...At any cost.Mia: H-How dare you!Edgeworth: Please, let us take a moment to think. Five years ago, this girl was kidnapped and nearly killed.Judge: Hmm...Edgeworth: But even worse than that... 5 years later... ...Dahlia Hawthorne lost something much more precious. Her big sister. Ms. Fey must be insane to even suggest that she murdered her.Mia: Whaaaaat!?Judge: ...I'm inclined to agree with the prosecutor's logic. Ms. Fey! Do you have any evidence to back up your assertion!? What possible reason would this witness have for killing her beloved sister!?Mia: W-Well you see... (I thought I was winning, but somehow he's turned it around on me!)Armando: Ha...! I think you need a little push in the right direction, Kitten...The defense is prepared to present evidence supporting our claim!Mia: Ah! That wasn't me! It was this guy... This crazy coffee addict...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I think we've heard enough empty threats from you, old man.Armando: Ha...! What makes you think they're empty, boy?Edgeworth: Because your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 looks like she's sweating bullets!Mia: Ah...! (I AM sweating bullets!)Armando: ...You think you're in a tough spot, huh?Mia: Of course! Aren't I?Armando: ...No. You've just arrived at the moment of truth, that's all. Whether you win or lose... That's up to you.Mia: (Up to me...?)Edgeworth: *sigh*... The rashness of youth. How charming.Mia: (This coming from someone younger than me!)Judge: Now then, let's not waste any more time. ...Ms. Fey. What motive would this witness have for murdering her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne?Present Victim's Note Mia: Leads to: \"...The story starts after Terry Fawles escaped.\"Present anything else Mia: Edgeworth: ...What is this? Is this the defense's idea of a joke? Judge: If so, I certainly don't get the punch line... Well? Ms. Fey? Mia: Oh, that was... The rashness of youth! Judge: Th-The rashness of youth!? And what is your point in furthering such a stereotype!? Armando: That witness stayed hidden for 5 years, Kitten. There must be a good reason for that. And somehow it must involve Valerie Hawthorne... Mia: (OK, one more time, Mia! You gotta read the Court Record more carefully this time!) Leads back to: \"Now then, let's not waste any more time. ...Ms. Fey.\"Mia: ...The story starts after Terry Fawles escaped. He called Valerie and told her he wanted to meet. This is the note she left... It says, \"Talk to Dahlia. Tell her this time, the whole truth must come out.\" ...Valerie Hawthorne gave Dahlia a warning. She told her she was going to reveal to the world the whole truth.Judge: The whole truth...?Mia: There was a dangerously important secret between Valerie and Dahlia. That's the reason Dahlia felt she had to kill Valerie... To keep her mouth shut permanently!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: A terrific story, Ms. Fey! If you like fiction, that is. Enlighten the court, Ms. Fey. What was this secret that was so important? Where's your evidence!?Armando: Dahlia and Valerie Hawthorne, and Terry Fawles... There's only one important secret that connects them all...Mia: Oh, yes... I know this secret. ...Your Honor! The defense would like to request further testimony.Judge: Wh-What testimony?Mia: Regarding the kidnapping 5 years ago. We believe it will explain a lot of things. Such as the nature of the important secret between the Hawthorne sisters!Dahlia: Ugh...!Judge: ...Very well. I'll grant your request for further testimony. I know it will be painful for you, but can enlighten us once more, my little maple leaf?Dahlia: Y-Yes, I-I'll try. Mr. Judge...Mia: (Putting on the old charm one more time, Dahlia? But this will be the last time you hide behind your womanly wiles!)Witness Testimony-- 5 Years Ago --Dahlia: Five years ago, I was kidnapped by Mr. Fawles. The ransom price was a raw diamond. My sister, Valerie, brought it to the bridge... After she made the exchange, she shot Mr. Fawles in the arm! That's when Mr. Fawles tried to kill me by shoving me off the bridge from behind! I survived, but I was afraid I might be kidnapped again for my family's money... So I decided to change my identity and start a new life...Judge: Hmmm...Edgeworth: ...The kidnapping left her emotionally scarred. With her sister's help, she left the Hawthorne family and started all over again. And we're to believe after all that, she murdered her sister? Preposterous!Judge: Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. ...Ms. Fey?Mia: Y-Yes, Your Honor.Judge: As you've heard, the witness is still traumatized from the kidnapping. ...I'll ask you again to be extremely gentle in your cross-examination.Mia: (...Mr. Edgeworth got the jump on me again...)Armando: Ha...! If we're not allowed to fight, then let's twist some arms. ...Listen up. We've still got that info... That ace up our sleeve.Mia: ...What info?Armando: Come on, Kitten. Don't say you've forgotten already. The fact that the kidnapping 5 years ago was staged!Mia: (That's right, it was a fake kidnapping! Terry Fawles told us that in the lobby.)Fawles: I do anything she says. Anything Dahlia says...Mia: What you're saying is that the kidnapping 5 years ago was planned by...Fawles: Yeah. Me and Dahlia... ...And Valerie, too.Mia: (Yes! That's it! The fake kidnapping is your best shot, Mia! That's her secret!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- 5 Years Ago --Dahlia: Five years ago, I was kidnapped by Mr. Fawles.Press Mia: Mia: Did you and Mr. Fawles have a relationship? Dahlia: ...Y-Yes. As a tutor... Mia: You were tutoring him? Mr. Fawles? Dahlia: N-No, of course not! Don't be ridiculous! Mr. Fawles came to the house to tutor ME! Mia: (That makes sense... 5 years ago, she was only 14.) Edgeworth: He probably came up with the kidnapping plan during that time. The Hawthornes are in the jewelry trade and are quite wealthy, you see. Judge: Hmm... Quite the clever fellow, that Mr. Fawles. Mia: (Did I hear him right!? Did he just call Mr. Fawles a clever fellow?)Dahlia: The ransom price was a raw diamond. My sister, Valerie, brought it to the bridge...Press Mia: Mia: I heard the diamond is valued in the neighboorhood [sic] of 2 million dollars. Judge: 2 million dollars!? Dahlia: It was still uncut, so it was about the size of a pint of milk. Judge: HMMMMM!!! A 2 million dollar pint of milk... I don't know what to think about that! Edgeworth: The defendant demanded that her sister, Valerie, make the exchange. Not as a detective, of course, but as an individual. Mia: By the way, I want to ask you, Mr. Edgeworth. Why do you think he wanted to make the exchange up there on that mountain? If he ever got surrounded, it would be hard to escape... Edgeworth: There's one thing a kidnapper wants to prevent, and that's police involvement. In a place like that, it would be easy to tell if he was being followed. With only one entrance to the mountain, he was ensuring his safety. Dahlia: What a wickedly clever man that Mr. Fawles is... Mia: (Yeah, right. It was all YOUR plan...) Dahlia: Anyway, Valerie brought the diamond to the mountain and...Dahlia: After she made the exchange, she shot Mr. Fawles in the arm!Press Mia: Mia: That was a dangerous thing to do considering you were being held hostage. Dahlia: Yes, but...  Actually, that saved my life. Judge: What do you mean? Dahlia: You see, Mr. Fawles was holding a knife in his right hand... Somehow, I just KNEW he was going to use it. I knew he was going to use that knife to kill me! Mia: ...! Dahlia: That's why my sister shot him! It was to save me!Dahlia: That's when Mr. Fawles tried to kill me by shoving me off the bridge from behind!Press Mia: Mia: I'd like to hear more about what happened right at that moment! Dahlia: Well, when Mr. Fawles was shot in the right arm, he let go of me... I-I was dazed. I turned to try and run away, but Mr. Fawles turned to grab me as well... As I ran past, he and I locked eyes for a second, and he gave me a large, bloodthirsty grin. Judge: B-Bloodthirsty grin... Oooh... Dahlia: And in the next instant... Edgeworth: I advise the court to remember that the river is 18 feet deep and incredibly swift... Dahlia: I-I was a strong swimmer, but I was knocked out... When I came to, I had been carried away by the river to a strange place. I'll never forget that day. The crumbling bridge, nowhere to run... Then just one little shove from behind. That was it. Before my sister could catch me... ...I fell into the river.Present Dusky Bridge Map Mia: Leads to: \"You say that Mr. Fawles pushed you into the Eagle River...\"Dahlia: I survived, but I was afraid I might be kidnapped again for my family's money...Press Mia: Mia: And that's why you hid your identity? Dahlia: Yes... I only told my sister. Judge: Valerie Hawthorne, eh. Dahlia: Yes, she's the only one who knew about me. Edgeworth: Meanwhile, legally, this witness has been deceased for 5 years. Dahlia: I... I didn't ever want something like that to happen to me again.Dahlia: So I decided to change my identity and start a new life...Press Mia: Mia: And that new identity was \"Melissa Foster\", right? Dahlia: Yes, my sister helped me get the official paperwork taken care of. Mia: (That makes sense... Without an insider's help, doing all of the paperwork would've been impossible.) Dahlia: She was the only person left in the world I could count on. And you... You think I k-k-killed her... There's no way I could! Judge: Hmmmmm...!Armando: It's the moment of truth for this witness, too. Once the truth about this staged kidnapping comes out... Everyone in the court will know how much of a Jezebel she really is!Mia: (I've just got to prove that kidnapping was a hoax!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Terry Fawles\nDescription: My client.

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants me to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the provided case. The testimonies are from Dahlia Hawthorne, who is testifying about the events five years ago.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, the key points are that she claims Mr. Fawles tried to kill her by pushing her off the bridge. The relevant evidence would be the Dusky Bridge Map. The map's description mentions that under the bridge is a sharp and solid rock bed. If Fawles pushed her off the bridge, she would have fallen onto the rocks, which contradicts the idea that she survived by falling into the river. Wait, no\u2014the river's current is strong, so maybe the body would be carried away. But in the bridge map, the river is 40 feet below. But Dahlia says she was pushed off and survived, ending up downstream. Wait, but the autopsy report from five years ago probably declared her dead. However, the bridge's structure might show that surviving such a fall is unlikely. Alternatively, the contradiction could be between her testimony of being pushed and the map showing the bridge's condition. Hmm.\n\nWait, the specific testimony is Testimony 3: \"That's when Mr. Fawles tried to kill me by shoving me off the bridge from behind!\" The evidence in question might be the Dusky Bridge Map (Evidence 2), which describes the bridge's structure. But how does that contradict her being pushed?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Camera (Evidence 7) which has a timer function. But that's more related to the recent crime. Let me check the testimonies again. The key contradiction here is that Dahlia claims she was pushed off the bridge by Fawles, but the actual events as per Terry's account and the note indicate that the kidnapping was staged. The Diamond (Evidence 8) was lost in the river. But Dahlia survived, which would mean the diamond could have been with her. However, the Diamond evidence is the ransom, which according to Terry's story, was taken by Dahlia when she fell into the river.\n\nWait, the contradiction might be in her testimony about being pushed versus the map's description. The map says under the bridge is a sharp and solid rock bed. If she was pushed from the bridge, she would hit the rocks, making survival unlikely, which contradicts her claim of surviving. But in the story, she was carried by the river's current. Wait, the river's current is known to be powerful, so even if she fell, the current could carry her away. Hmm. Maybe another angle.\n\nLooking back, the Victim's Note (Evidence 3) mentions \"Talk to Dahlia. Tell her this time, the whole truth must come out.\" This note is from Valerie, indicating that Dahlia was alive and involved in the current case. But Dahlia's testimony is about the past event. Wait, perhaps the contradiction is in her testimony about the kidnapping being real versus the evidence from Terry that it was a setup. But how does that tie to a specific testimony and evidence pair?\n\nWait, the key point is Dahlia's testimony that she was kidnapped by Fawles, which is contradicted by Terry's account that it was a fake kidnapping planned by him, Dahlia, and Valerie. But how does that relate to the evidence? The Victim's Note (Evidence 3) is from Valerie, which says \"Talk to Dahlia. Tell her this time, the whole truth must come out.\" This suggests that Dahlia was alive and involved, contradicting her testimony that she had to change her identity because she was afraid of being kidnapped again. But the specific testimony here is Testimony 4: \"I survived, but I was afraid I might be kidnapped again for my family's money...\" which implies the initial kidnapping was real. However, the truth is that the kidnapping was staged, so her fear of being kidnapped again is based on a lie. But which evidence directly contradicts this?\n\nAlternatively, the Diamond (Evidence 8) was the ransom, and according to Terry's story, Dahlia took it with her when she jumped into the river. If the diamond was lost, but Dahlia survived, she would have the diamond. However, she changed her identity, so maybe the existence of the diamond being missing supports her survival but contradicts the official story that she died. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the key contradiction is between Dahlia's testimony that Fawles pushed her off the bridge (Testimony 3) and the Dusky Bridge Map (Evidence 2) which shows that the bridge is broken midway. If she was pushed from the bridge, the location might matter. Alternatively, the bridge's structure being broken might affect the possibility of the events she described. Wait, the bridge's broken part is towards the east, and the parking lot is west. But the photo from the witness (Melissa/Dahlia) shows the victim standing near the broken end. Maybe that's part of the contradiction in the current case, but here we're focusing on the testimony about the past event.\n\nAlternatively, the Camera (Evidence 7) with the timer shows that the photo could have been taken without her being present, but that's part of the current case's contradiction, not the past.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is the fact that Dahlia claims she was pushed off the bridge (Testimony 3), but according to the Dusky Bridge Map (Evidence 2), under the bridge is a sharp and solid rock bed, making survival unlikely. However, she did survive, which might be possible due to the river's current, but the map's description might indicate that the fall would be fatal, contradicting her survival. However, the river's current is known to carry bodies away, so that's not necessarily a contradiction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the real contradiction is between her claim of being pushed (Testimony 3) and Terry's account that she jumped. But that's not evidence, that's another testimony. The user wants evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, the Victim's Note (Evidence 3) includes the message \"Talk to Dahlia. Tell her this time, the whole truth must come out.\" This implies that Dahlia is alive and Valerie was going to expose the truth about the fake kidnapping. Dahlia's testimony (Testimony 0) states she was kidnapped by Fawles, but the note suggests the kidnapping was staged, contradicting her testimony. So Evidence 3 (Victim's Note) contradicts Testimony 0 (Five years ago, I was kidnapped by Mr. Fawles). But in the note, Valerie is telling Dahlia to come clean, implying the kidnapping was a setup. Therefore, Dahlia's testimony that she was kidnapped is a lie, and the note is evidence of that. So the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 3.\n\nWait, but the user's answer needs to be in the format {\"evidence\": x, \"testimony\": y}. So which evidence and testimony contradict? Let me check the indexes. The testimonies are numbered 0-5. The evidence is 0-8.\n\nEvidence 3 is the Victim's Note. Testimony 0 is Dahlia's first testimony: \"Five years ago, I was kidnapped by Mr. Fawles.\" The note's content implies the kidnapping was staged, hence contradicting her statement that she was kidnapped. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 3 (Victim's Note) and Testimony 0 (Five years ago, I was kidnapped by Mr. Fawles)."

What the witness said just now was tremendously important! I'd like it added to the official testimony! Edgeworth: The prosecution has no objection... After all, the defendant is a killer and a mentally unbalanced one at that... That testimony only helps to further prove that point... Judge: Hmm...! Mia: N-No, that's not why I...

The judge already has a bad enough opinion of him...) Judge: You just can't trust someone with a bad memory. What did you eat for dinner one week ago today? ...At the very least, a person should remember that much. As for me, it was payday, so I had a nice moose steak with some poutine on the side. Mia: (...And how does this relate to anything!?) Edgeworth: Whether it's eating steak or committing murder, a person shouldn't deny their actions. I'm in complete agreement, Your Honor. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement \"I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.\") Mia: Mia: A grudge...? Melissa: Well, the policewoman's testimony was crucial, wasn't it? ...Crucial in getting the defendant sentenced to death. Edgeworth: Yes, and that's precisely why he harbored such deep anger against her. So much anger that he forgot his own guilt... Mia: Mia: My client has always maintained that he's innocent of those charges! Melissa: He seems rather forgetful. ...Your client, I mean. Mia: ...! Melissa: Not only did he forget about what he did, but he forgot the poor policewoman as well.Melissa: I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.Press Mia: Mia: What do you mean by lucky? Melissa: Well... It's February now. Everyone is wearing scarves. If I had accidentally worn a white scarf like he said... Edgeworth: Then you yourself might have been killed. Judge: Hmmmmm... That would've been a terrible loss for this world! Armando: Ha...! It looks like you pressed too hard this time, Kitten. Mia: Mr. Armando... Armando: Keep looking around you and you're going to lose sight of the finish line. Justice is blind, but she's not deaf. Sometimes you have to know when not to talk.Present Scarf Mia: Mia: Witness... I want you to look at this photo you took.

The scarf the policewoman was wearing... Mia: (I've got her now, just don't mess up...) ...But that's strange.

I just think the defendant is a terrible, horrible monster!Press Mia: Mia: You knew about that incident? But weren't you out of the country until the year before last? Melissa: Well, I saw a report about the escaped convict on the news. They had an in-depth report about his whole history. Judge: So you were still living abroad 5 years ago, is that right? Melissa: Yes...Mia: (I can't let her get away with these lies...!)Armando: Listen to me. She's neck-deep in this whole thing... Somehow, you're just going to have to get her to show the court her true self.-- Melissa Foster's History --Melissa: I... I was out of the country until the year before last.Press Mia: Mia: So, what country were you living in then? Melissa: We were all living abroad, but after my parents were killed... Edgeworth: It was a brutal civil war. She had to try to make her way back home alone... Melissa: I lost everything... I didn't even have any personal identification... Mia: (What kind of sob story is this...? ...What do I do? Should I press her for details?) Wait and see Mia: (There's nothing I can do about her claim to have lost all her identification. All I can do is wait to find some other evidence about her real identity.) Judge: Very well then, Ms. Foster. Please proceed. Leads back to cross-examination Press her harder Mia: ...Witness. Answer my question. I'll even repeat it for you. What country were you in? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this line of questioning is childish. What country she was in and how many languages she may speak are irrelevant here. What we're here to evaluate is whether this witness has any connection to this case. Melissa: I've lived abroad ever since I was a little girl... That's why I could never have known Mr. Fawles or Detective Hawthorne. Edgeworth: Yes... I think we've established that point. Judge: Yes, indeed. Well then. Shall we add what you've just stated to the official testimony? Melissa: Yes, please. ...Mr. Judge. Adds statement \"Naturally, I didn't know either the victim or the defendant.\"Press (after adding statement \"Naturally, I didn't know either the victim or the defendant.\") Mia: Mia: So, what country were you living in then? Melissa: We were all living abroad, but after my parents were killed... Edgeworth: It was a brutal civil war. She had to try to make her way back home alone... Melissa: I lost everything... I didn't even have any personal identification... Mia: (What kind of sob story is this...?)Melissa: Naturally, I didn't know either the victim or the defendant.Press Mia: Mia: You didn't know either person? Are you certain of that? Melissa: Yes. I'm afraid I'm rather shy around people. Judge: Hmm... Oh well, that can't be helped. Mia: (Why is he just agreeing with everything that comes out of her mouth...?) Judge: The first time you saw either of them was when they were on the bridge, correct? Melissa: Yes... It really was a coincidence.Melissa: Until I entered college, I had never even been to Eagle Mountain before...Press Mia: Mia: So what made you decide to go to Eagle Mountain anyway? Melissa: I just love being outdoors... Picnics, hiking... You know, that sort of thing. Mia: (...You don't look like much of a hiker to me. But you do look like a digger of sorts.) But Eagle Mountain is a two-hour drive from here and no trains run through there. There are plenty of mountains that are closer and easier to get to. Melissa: Well, I went there once with the college Hiking Club. I fell in love with its stark, desolate beauty and its cold, yet romantic, gloominess... Mia: (Didn't know you were such a goth...) By the way, what's the name of your college...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The prosecution objects to any questions that involve the witness's private life. Mia: ...! Edgeworth: All that matters is that she is a material witness to a crime. The witness doesn't need to respond to questions that are clearly malicious in intent. Melissa: Thank you! She's really gone too far...! Judge: Hmmmmm! Ms. Fey! You're treading on thin ice here! Mia: (I hardly said anything! Talk about sensitive...)Melissa: And I certainly don't have any reason for wanting to hurt a police officer.Press Mia: Mia: Perhaps, but your behavior that day was very suspicious! Not only have you contradicted yourself here in court, but you know things you shouldn't. For example, the scratches on the trunk of the car. Melissa: Well th-that's... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately Ms. Fey, your last statement proves nothing. Mia: Oh really!? And why is that? Edgeworth: The witness came to the police station once to identify the suspect. It's entirely possible that, at that time, an officer showed her this photo. Judge: Hmm... That seems like a rather serious mistake. Armando: Ha...! That's the oldest trick in the prosecutor's book. Mia: Th-That's not fair...! Melissa: That wicked inmate... I'll never be able to forget that horrible day...Melissa: Holding a grudge and killing the officer who testified against you 5 years ago...Press Mia: Mia: A grudge...? Melissa: Well, the policewoman's testimony was crucial, wasn't it? ...Crucial in getting the defendant sentenced to death. Edgeworth: Yes, and that's precisely why he harbored such deep anger against her. So much anger that he forgot his own guilt... Mia: Mia: My client has always maintained that he's innocent of those charges! Melissa: He seems rather forgetful. ...Your client, I mean. Mia: ...! Melissa: Not only did he forget about what he did, but he forgot the poor policewoman as well. Mia: What do you mean by that? Melissa: Your client... He forgot what the detective looked like, right? It's too bad for her that he didn't forget about her testimony as well. Mia: (Well, she's right about that. Mr. Fawles is kind of forgetful...) Wait and see Mia: (Any more damage to my client's image could be a disaster... The judge already has a bad enough opinion of him...) Judge: You just can't trust someone with a bad memory. What did you eat for dinner one week ago today? ...At the very least, a person should remember that much. As for me, it was payday, so I had a nice moose steak with some poutine on the side. Mia: (...And how does this relate to anything!?) Edgeworth: Whether it's eating steak or committing murder, a person shouldn't deny their actions. I'm in complete agreement, Your Honor. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Mia: You said, \"he forgot what the detective looked like.\" What did you mean by that? Melissa: Well he couldn't tell who she was without some kind of identification, right? Edgeworth: Quite right... That's why the victim was wearing a scarf as identification. Melissa: Why, if I had been wearing a white scarf that day... ...then he probably would have tried to kill me... Judge: Hmm... That's true. He's clearly a bitter man! Mia: (This is bad. Mr. Fawles's reputation just keeps getting worse and worse. Sometimes it's best not to poke too deep... What should I do with that last statement?) Have it added to the testimony Mia: Your Honor! What the witness said just now was tremendously important! I'd like it added to the official testimony! Edgeworth: The prosecution has no objection... After all, the defendant is a killer and a mentally unbalanced one at that... That testimony only helps to further prove that point... Judge: Hmm...! Mia: N-No, that's not why I... Judge: Enough. ...Witness, if you would? Melissa: My pleasure, Mr. Judge. Adds statement \"I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.\" Leave it alone Mia: (Any more damage to my client's image could be a disaster... The judge already has a bad enough opinion of him...) Judge: You just can't trust someone with a bad memory.

Melissa: Not only did he forget about what he did, but he forgot the poor policewoman as well.Melissa: I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.Press Mia: Mia: What do you mean by lucky? Melissa: Well... It's February now. Everyone is wearing scarves. If I had accidentally worn a white scarf like he said... Edgeworth: Then you yourself might have been killed. Judge: Hmmmmm... That would've been a terrible loss for this world! Armando: Ha...! It looks like you pressed too hard this time, Kitten. Mia: Mr. Armando... Armando: Keep looking around you and you're going to lose sight of the finish line. Justice is blind, but she's not deaf. Sometimes you have to know when not to talk.Present Scarf Mia: Mia: Witness... I want you to look at this photo you took. It's hard to see in the photo, but look at the scarf the victim wore as identification. Judge: Ah, you are talking about this scarf right here, eh? Melissa: Y-Yes! That's it! The scarf the policewoman was wearing... Mia: (I've got her now, just don't mess up...) ...But that's strange. In your testimony, you stated the following... \"I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.\" Judge: Wh-White? Mia: ...This is the scarf you identified as belonging to the victim. But it certainly doesn't look white to me! Melissa: Oh...! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, it was foggy that day... And it was raining as well! It's not surprising that she mistook it for white! Mia: Mia: Sorry, but not this time. The witness just confirmed that this was the victim's scarf! Judge: Yes, but... What's the significance...? It's true that the scarf doesn't look white, but... Mia: There's only one explanation for this mix-up! The reason why the witness thought the scarf was white is...! Present Victim's Note Mia: Leads to: \"...Witness. Have you ever seen this note?\" Present anything else Mia: Mia: Here's the definitive piece of evidence that proves it! Melissa: ... Edgeworth: ...... Judge: That...? That's your definitive piece of evidence? Mia: Yes! ...If my thinking is correct. Edgeworth: Well then. We have one mystery solved! The answer is simple. Ms. Fey's thinking is wrong. ...That's all there is to it. Mia: Huh? Armando: Please, Kitten. You've got to do something... You're killing me over here. Judge: Ms. Fey, I've got a definitive penalty to reward you for your definitive piece of evidence. Mia: (Well, that wasn't what I was expecting...) Judge: Well... Do you have evidence or not? Perhaps you can tell us about why the witness thought the scarf was white, eh... Leads back to: \"There's only one explanation for this mix-up!\" Mia: ...Witness. Have you ever seen this note? Melissa: N-Note...? I, err... No, never... Judge: It's top-secret evidence. There's no reason that you would have. Mia: Hmm, I wonder about that... Melissa: Wh-What do you mean...? Mia: This note shows Mr. Fawles's instructions to the victim regarding their meeting. It says... \"Wear white scarf for identification.\" Edgeworth: White... Scarf...? AAAAAAH!!! Mia: Witness! You KNEW what this note said! And it's because you knew, that you slipped up and mistakenly said \"white scarf\"! (Changed from [There's no other possible reason for you to mistake the scarf's color!] in the original release) Leads to: \"Ugh... Unn... Urgh...!\"Present Victim's Note Mia: Mia: ...It's true. Mr. Fawles did give instructions to Valerie Hawthorne about their meeting. The note that she left said: \"Wear white scarf for identification.\" Judge: Yes, what about it...? Mia: Isn't it obvious!? Doesn't it strike you as odd!? That note was a secret piece of evidence! How is it that the witness knows about it!? Melissa: Ah...! Judge: Order! Order! Hmm... It is odd, isn't it? Well, Mr. Edgeworth!? Did you show top-secret evidence to the witness...? Edgeworth: Y-Your Honor... I certainly never gave anyone permission to do such a thing. Mia: In that case, the only way the witness could know about the note would b-- Melissa: J-Just a moment! Of course... Of course I didn't know about the note! It's just... I saw it when it happened. ...With my own eyes. When the victim went to see the killer... She used her own scarf to signal him. That's why... That's why I assumed that the signal was a white scarf. Judge: Hmmm... I suppose that makes sense. Mia: (Come on, Mia! You can't let her weasel out of it that easily!) ...Witness! Sorry, but your explanation isn't going to work here. Melissa: B-But why!? It-It's true! That's what I saw! Mia: Impossible. There's no way you could have seen the victim use a white scarf to signal him! Present Scarf Mia: Leads to: \"You've said several times in your testimony that the victim was wearing a scarf...\" Present anything else Mia: Mia: Here's the definitive piece of evidence that proves it!

Mia: (Come on, Mia! You're running out of time...!) Leads back to: \"...Witness! Sorry, but your explanation isn't going to work here.\" Mia: You've said several times in your testimony that the victim was wearing a scarf... ...A white scarf, correct? Melissa: Yes... Is something wrong...? Mia: That's what I'd like to know. ...Ms. Foster. Have a look at this. It's the victim's scarf! Melissa: Ah...! Mia: I'm sure people would disagree about what to call this color. ...However! It certainly is not white! You KNEW what the note said! Edgeworth: She knew... the contents of the note...? N-NOOOOOOOO! Mia: It says, \"Wear white scarf for identification.\" That's the reason why you said it was white! Leads to: \"Ugh... Unn... Urgh...!\"Melissa: Or kidnapping a poor girl... I just think the defendant is a terrible, horrible monster!Press Mia: Mia: You knew about that incident? But weren't you out of the country until the year before last? Melissa: Well, I saw a report about the escaped convict on the news. They had an in-depth report about his whole history. Judge: So you were still living abroad 5 years ago, is that right? Melissa: Yes...Mia: (I can't let her get away with these lies...!)Armando: Listen to me. She's neck-deep in this whole thing... Somehow, you're just going to have to get her to show the court her true self.Melissa: Ugh... Unn... Urgh...!Mia: Well, Ms. Foster!?Melissa: NOOOOOOOOO!Judge: Order! Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! I'm waiting for an explanation!Edgeworth: I'm quite sure this note wasn't leaked to the public!Mia: And yet...! This witness knew exactly what the note said! At the time of the murder, the number of people that knew were quite... limited. Terry Fawles is one. The person who wrote the note, Valerie Hawthorne, is another. And finally... One more person.Judge: Did you say... \"One more person\"?Armando: That's right... A person that no one would have suspected... Have you figured it out, Kitten?Mia: Yup! The third person that knew the contents of the note was...!Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Mia: Leads to: \"And that person is... Dahlia Hawthorne!\"Present anything else Mia: Armando: ...Hang on there, Kitten. Mia: What is it, Mr. Armando? Armando: Here. I made some special caf\u00e9 con leche for you... I put in plenty of sugar. Drink it up before it gets cold. Don't be shy. Mia: Umm... Why are you doing this? Armando: Your brain needs stimulation. Drink some of this and then think it over again. Listen. Keep messing up like that and you're going to get the judge mad. Judge: Ms. Fey! Don't just stand there casually drinking coffee! Mia: (Oops... I think it's too late...) B-But Your Honor...! Th-There is one more person! There is a person besides Mr. Fawles and the victim that knew what the note said. Leads back to: \"That's right... A person that no one would have suspected...\"Mia: And that person is... Dahlia Hawthorne!Judge: Dahlia Hawthorne...? I've never heard that name before.Mia: Look at the victim's note. This is what it says... \"Talk to Dahlia. Tell her this time...\" There is her name, right there.Judge: Wh-What's this... So who is this person!? This... Dahlia Hawthorne...Edgeworth: *sigh*... Ms. Fey must be desperate if she's trying to bring the dead back to life.Judge: The d-dead...?Edgeworth: Dahlia Hawthorne was the victim's deceased younger sister. She was killed in a crime 5 years ago.Judge: Killed in a crime...? Y-You don't mean...!?Edgeworth: Yes. She was kidnapped... And killed. By Terry Fawles!Mia:Mia: You said she was \"killed\"... But was she really?Edgeworth: What are you implying...?Mia: Of course, people thought she had died 5 years ago... ...when she fell off of Dusky Bridge and was lost in the Eagle River. However! Her corpse was never found!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: She was declared legally dead 5 years ago! As far as the law is concerned, Dahlia Hawthorne is officially dead.Mia:Mia: But the fact remains that her body was never recovered! Dahlia Hawthorne was 14 years old, 5 years ago. If she were still alive, she would be 19 now. ...Melissa Foster. I believe that's the same age you are!Melissa: Ah...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Even you couldn't...! Ms. Fey...! You're not saying...!Mia: But I am. That's precisely what I'm saying. This \"witness\" before us is the girl that was kidnapped and killed 5 years ago! This girl is in fact Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne!Judge: WHA...! WHAAAAAAT!Armando: Ha...! Nice work... That was like tossing a grenade into a 3-alarm fire! But unless you can tie all the loose ends together... ...you're nothing but a hit-and-run arsonist.Mia: I... I understand. (If I can expose her true nature, I can turn this whole case on its head! Now is my chance to make Mr. Edgeworth squirm...!)Judge: Hmm... Hmm... Hmmm... Witness! Just who are you anyway!?Melissa: I... I... I'm...Edgeworth: I didn't think it'd come to this. That's enough... You don't have to say anymore, witness.Melissa: ... Yes. I understand.Judge: Wh-What! Mr. Edgeworth! Explain yourself!Edgeworth: Your Honor. I have an admission to make. I honestly never thought the defense would pursue the matter this far...Judge: You don't...! You don't mean...!Edgeworth: ...Yes. The prosecutor's office isn't filled with fools, you know. Naturally, we conduct full background checks on all of our witnesses.Mia: Wh-What did he say...?Armando: Ha...! It looks like the kid knew. He knew her true identity from the get-go.Mia: No way...! But then why...!Armando: If you hadn't revealed her secret, he wasn't going to say anything about it. All he wanted was her testimony, so he made a little trade.Edgeworth: Let me introduce you to... ...the victim's younger sister, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge: But... But... I thought she died 5 years ago...?Edgeworth: We thought so as well... But... Well, as you can see...Mia: Why!? Why did she hide her identity for 5 years!?Edgeworth: That has nothing to do with the current case. She was merely an accidental witness to a crime...Mia:Mia: Accidental...? I don't believe that for a minute! For the last 5 years, she's been playing the role of victim! And now we find her acting suspiciously at another murder scene!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Really, Ms. Fey! I must say, your strategy here is painfully obvious. (Changed from [...Really, Ms. Fey! Your strategy is clearly obvious.] in the original release) You're trying to pin your client's crime on an innocent witness in order to win... ...At any cost.Mia: H-How dare you!Edgeworth: Please, let us take a moment to think. Five years ago, this girl was kidnapped and nearly killed.Judge: Hmm...Edgeworth: But even worse than that... 5 years later... ...Dahlia Hawthorne lost something much more precious. Her big sister. Ms. Fey must be insane to even suggest that she murdered her.Mia: Whaaaaat!?Judge: ...I'm inclined to agree with the prosecutor's logic. Ms. Fey! Do you have any evidence to back up your assertion!? What possible reason would this witness have for killing her beloved sister!?Mia: W-Well you see... (I thought I was winning, but somehow he's turned it around on me!)Armando: Ha...! I think you need a little push in the right direction, Kitten...The defense is prepared to present evidence supporting our claim!Mia: Ah! That wasn't me! It was this guy... This crazy coffee addict...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I think we've heard enough empty threats from you, old man.Armando: Ha...! What makes you think they're empty, boy?Edgeworth: Because your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 looks like she's sweating bullets!Mia: Ah...! (I AM sweating bullets!)Armando: ...You think you're in a tough spot, huh?Mia: Of course! Aren't I?Armando: ...No. You've just arrived at the moment of truth, that's all. Whether you win or lose... That's up to you.Mia: (Up to me...?)Edgeworth: *sigh*... The rashness of youth. How charming.Mia: (This coming from someone younger than me!)Judge: Now then, let's not waste any more time. ...Ms. Fey. What motive would this witness have for murdering her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne?Present Victim's Note Mia: Leads to: \"...The story starts after Terry Fawles escaped.\"Present anything else Mia: Edgeworth: ...What is this? Is this the defense's idea of a joke? Judge: If so, I certainly don't get the punch line... Well? Ms. Fey? Mia: Oh, that was... The rashness of youth! Judge: Th-The rashness of youth!? And what is your point in furthering such a stereotype!? Armando: That witness stayed hidden for 5 years, Kitten. There must be a good reason for that. And somehow it must involve Valerie Hawthorne... Mia: (OK, one more time, Mia! You gotta read the Court Record more carefully this time!) Leads back to: \"Now then, let's not waste any more time. ...Ms. Fey.\"Mia: ...The story starts after Terry Fawles escaped. He called Valerie and told her he wanted to meet. This is the note she left... It says, \"Talk to Dahlia. Tell her this time, the whole truth must come out.\" ...Valerie Hawthorne gave Dahlia a warning. She told her she was going to reveal to the world the whole truth.Judge: The whole truth...?Mia: There was a dangerously important secret between Valerie and Dahlia. That's the reason Dahlia felt she had to kill Valerie... To keep her mouth shut permanently!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: A terrific story, Ms. Fey! If you like fiction, that is. Enlighten the court, Ms. Fey. What was this secret that was so important? Where's your evidence!?Armando: Dahlia and Valerie Hawthorne, and Terry Fawles... There's only one important secret that connects them all...Mia: Oh, yes... I know this secret. ...Your Honor! The defense would like to request further testimony.Judge: Wh-What testimony?Mia: Regarding the kidnapping 5 years ago. We believe it will explain a lot of things. Such as the nature of the important secret between the Hawthorne sisters!Dahlia: Ugh...!Judge: ...Very well. I'll grant your request for further testimony. I know it will be painful for you, but can enlighten us once more, my little maple leaf?Dahlia: Y-Yes, I-I'll try. Mr. Judge...Mia: (Putting on the old charm one more time, Dahlia? But this will be the last time you hide behind your womanly wiles!)Witness Testimony-- 5 Years Ago --Dahlia: Five years ago, I was kidnapped by Mr. Fawles. The ransom price was a raw diamond. My sister, Valerie, brought it to the bridge... After she made the exchange, she shot Mr. Fawles in the arm! That's when Mr. Fawles tried to kill me by shoving me off the bridge from behind! I survived, but I was afraid I might be kidnapped again for my family's money... So I decided to change my identity and start a new life...Judge: Hmmm...Edgeworth: ...The kidnapping left her emotionally scarred. With her sister's help, she left the Hawthorne family and started all over again. And we're to believe after all that, she murdered her sister? Preposterous!Judge: Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. ...Ms. Fey?Mia: Y-Yes, Your Honor.Judge: As you've heard, the witness is still traumatized from the kidnapping. ...I'll ask you again to be extremely gentle in your cross-examination.Mia: (...Mr. Edgeworth got the jump on me again...)Armando: Ha...! If we're not allowed to fight, then let's twist some arms. ...Listen up. We've still got that info... That ace up our sleeve.Mia: ...What info?Armando: Come on, Kitten. Don't say you've forgotten already. The fact that the kidnapping 5 years ago was staged!Mia: (That's right, it was a fake kidnapping! Terry Fawles told us that in the lobby.)Fawles: I do anything she says. Anything Dahlia says...Mia: What you're saying is that the kidnapping 5 years ago was planned by...Fawles: Yeah. Me and Dahlia... ...And Valerie, too.Mia: (Yes! That's it! The fake kidnapping is your best shot, Mia! That's her secret!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- 5 Years Ago --Dahlia: Five years ago, I was kidnapped by Mr. Fawles.Press Mia: Mia: Did you and Mr. Fawles have a relationship? Dahlia: ...Y-Yes. As a tutor... Mia: You were tutoring him? Mr. Fawles? Dahlia: N-No, of course not! Don't be ridiculous! Mr. Fawles came to the house to tutor ME! Mia: (That makes sense... 5 years ago, she was only 14.) Edgeworth: He probably came up with the kidnapping plan during that time. The Hawthornes are in the jewelry trade and are quite wealthy, you see. Judge: Hmm... Quite the clever fellow, that Mr. Fawles. Mia: (Did I hear him right!? Did he just call Mr. Fawles a clever fellow?)Dahlia: The ransom price was a raw diamond. My sister, Valerie, brought it to the bridge...Press Mia: Mia: I heard the diamond is valued in the neighboorhood [sic] of 2 million dollars. Judge: 2 million dollars!? Dahlia: It was still uncut, so it was about the size of a pint of milk. Judge: HMMMMM!!! A 2 million dollar pint of milk... I don't know what to think about that! Edgeworth: The defendant demanded that her sister, Valerie, make the exchange. Not as a detective, of course, but as an individual. Mia: By the way, I want to ask you, Mr. Edgeworth. Why do you think he wanted to make the exchange up there on that mountain? If he ever got surrounded, it would be hard to escape... Edgeworth: There's one thing a kidnapper wants to prevent, and that's police involvement. In a place like that, it would be easy to tell if he was being followed. With only one entrance to the mountain, he was ensuring his safety. Dahlia: What a wickedly clever man that Mr. Fawles is... Mia: (Yeah, right. It was all YOUR plan...) Dahlia: Anyway, Valerie brought the diamond to the mountain and...Dahlia: After she made the exchange, she shot Mr. Fawles in the arm!Press Mia: Mia: That was a dangerous thing to do considering you were being held hostage. Dahlia: Yes, but...  Actually, that saved my life. Judge: What do you mean? Dahlia: You see, Mr. Fawles was holding a knife in his right hand... Somehow, I just KNEW he was going to use it. I knew he was going to use that knife to kill me! Mia: ...! Dahlia: That's why my sister shot him! It was to save me!Dahlia: That's when Mr. Fawles tried to kill me by shoving me off the bridge from behind!Press Mia: Mia: I'd like to hear more about what happened right at that moment! Dahlia: Well, when Mr. Fawles was shot in the right arm, he let go of me... I-I was dazed. I turned to try and run away, but Mr. Fawles turned to grab me as well... As I ran past, he and I locked eyes for a second, and he gave me a large, bloodthirsty grin. Judge: B-Bloodthirsty grin... Oooh... Dahlia: And in the next instant... Edgeworth: I advise the court to remember that the river is 18 feet deep and incredibly swift... Dahlia: I-I was a strong swimmer, but I was knocked out... When I came to, I had been carried away by the river to a strange place. I'll never forget that day. The crumbling bridge, nowhere to run... Then just one little shove from behind. That was it. Before my sister could catch me... ...I fell into the river.Present Dusky Bridge Map Mia: Leads to: \"You say that Mr. Fawles pushed you into the Eagle River...\"Dahlia: I survived, but I was afraid I might be kidnapped again for my family's money...Press Mia: Mia: And that's why you hid your identity? Dahlia: Yes... I only told my sister. Judge: Valerie Hawthorne, eh. Dahlia: Yes, she's the only one who knew about me. Edgeworth: Meanwhile, legally, this witness has been deceased for 5 years. Dahlia: I... I didn't ever want something like that to happen to me again.Dahlia: So I decided to change my identity and start a new life...Press Mia: Mia: And that new identity was \"Melissa Foster\", right? Dahlia: Yes, my sister helped me get the official paperwork taken care of. Mia: (That makes sense... Without an insider's help, doing all of the paperwork would've been impossible.) Dahlia: She was the only person left in the world I could count on. And you... You think I k-k-killed her... There's no way I could! Judge: Hmmmmm...!Armando: It's the moment of truth for this witness, too. Once the truth about this staged kidnapping comes out... Everyone in the court will know how much of a Jezebel she really is!Mia: (I've just got to prove that kidnapping was a hoax!)-- 5 Years Ago --Dahlia: Five years ago, I was kidnapped by Mr. Fawles.Press Mia: Mia: Did you and Mr. Fawles have a relationship?

Edgeworth: I advise the court to remember that the river is 18 feet deep and incredibly swift... Dahlia: I-I was a strong swimmer, but I was knocked out... When I came to, I had been carried away by the river to a strange place. I'll never forget that day. The crumbling bridge, nowhere to run... Then just one little shove from behind. That was it. Before my sister could catch me... ...I fell into the river.Present Dusky Bridge Map Mia: Leads to: \"You say that Mr. Fawles pushed you into the Eagle River...\"Dahlia: I survived, but I was afraid I might be kidnapped again for my family's money...Press Mia: Mia: And that's why you hid your identity? Dahlia: Yes... I only told my sister. Judge: Valerie Hawthorne, eh. Dahlia: Yes, she's the only one who knew about me. Edgeworth: Meanwhile, legally, this witness has been deceased for 5 years. Dahlia: I... I didn't ever want something like that to happen to me again.Dahlia: So I decided to change my identity and start a new life...Press Mia: Mia: And that new identity was \"Melissa Foster\", right? Dahlia: Yes, my sister helped me get the official paperwork taken care of. Mia: (That makes sense... Without an insider's help, doing all of the paperwork would've been impossible.) Dahlia: She was the only person left in the world I could count on. And you... You think I k-k-killed her... There's no way I could! Judge: Hmmmmm...!Armando: It's the moment of truth for this witness, too. Once the truth about this staged kidnapping comes out... Everyone in the court will know how much of a Jezebel she really is!Mia: (I've just got to prove that kidnapping was a hoax!)Mia: You say that Mr. Fawles pushed you into the Eagle River... However, that's hard to believe.Dahlia: B-But it's true! I felt a push on my back... I'm certain of it! It was Mr. Fawles!Mia: I'm sorry... I guess I wasn't clear enough. I shouldn't have said, \"that's hard to believe.\" I should've said, \"That's impossible.\"Dahlia: I-Impossible...?Mia: I ask that the court recall the condition of Dusky Bridge, now and 5 years ago. That bridge hasn't changed one bit in these last 5 years. If someone had pushed you from behind as you have claimed... ...instead of being carried away by the river... ...you would have been smashed by the bedrock below! A most certain death.Dahlia: ...Mia: Do you understand now, Dahlia Hawthorne? The very notion that my client pushed you from behind is impossible!Dahlia: ... Aaaaaah!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Your Honor, this event occurred 5 years ago! Why, for all we know, the water level in the river may have been higher back then.Mia:Mia: But it's 40 feet from the bridge to the river! A small change in the water level wouldn't have made a difference!Edgeworth: Ugggh!Judge: Y-You're right! If the events occurred just as the witness has testified... ...then the defendant couldn't have pushed the witness into the river. Young lady! What is the meaning of this!?Dahlia: Uuuh! I... I... I, err... You see, I...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Just a moment, Your Honor! It's true that the witness testified that the defendant pushed her into the river... However! She never stated that she fell from the back end of the bridge!Mia: What... What do you mean?Edgeworth: After being shot in the arm, it's plausible that Mr. Fawles panicked! Therefore, he could have unwittingly pushed her off the side of the bridge!Judge: If that's true, she would have fallen into the river! Well, Miss Hawthorne!? Is Mr. Edgeworth's explanation correct...?Dahlia: ... Now that you mention it... I do remember now. When I fell off the bridge... ...my skirt got caught on one of the bridge's side wires!Mia: You can't be serious!Judge: Order! Order in the court!Edgeworth: It seems Ms. Fey's assault has finally reached its conclusion.Mia:Mia: (Not now, Mia...! This is no time to retreat!) Unfortunately for you... this is just the start of Ms. Fey's assault!Edgeworth: Wh-What?Mia: I believe your reasoning went something like this, Mr. Edgeworth. \"After being shot in the arm, it's plausible that Mr. Fawles panicked! Therefore, he could have unwittingly pushed her off the side of the bridge!\" However! Once again, I'm forced to say, \"That's impossible!\"Edgeworth: R-Ridiculous! What's so impossible about it!?Mia: Because your flawed logic contradicts the Court Record!Present Witness's Photo Mia: Leads to: \"Your Honor! All of the answers are right here in this photo!\"Present anything else Mia: Mia: This evidence shows the fatal error you've made! Edgeworth: ... It's a fatal error, alright. Unfortunately... The error is yours, not mine. Mia: (Uh-oh, here it comes...) Judge: Ms. Fey. At this point in the trial, I can't just let that pass! Mia: Ouchie. (Come on, Mia! Take your time and think it over again!) Leads back to: \"I believe your reasoning went something like this, Mr. Edgeworth.\"Mia: Your Honor! All of the answers are right here in this photo! Take a look at the wires supporting both sides of the bridge! They extend up to about five feet off the ground... It would be impossible to push someone off from there!Dahlia: NNNNOOOOOOO!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: B-But let's remember the size and strength of the defendant! Wires like this wouldn't be a problem for him! He could have easily picked up a 14 year old girl and thrown her over!Mia:Mia: So young, and already so forgetful, Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Fawles had been shot in the right arm.Judge: Ah...!Mia: And more importantly... ...Valerie Hawthorne had her gun trained on him... at point-blank range!Edgeworth: Ugh...!Mia: So! Mr. Fawles throwing the witness off the bridge? That is clearly impossible!Edgeworth: GWAAAAAAAHHH!Judge: Order! Order! Wh-What is the meaning of this!?Mia: Dahlia Hawthorne! You jumped into the Eagle River intentionally!Judge: What...!? What is this...!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Indeed! What do you mean by such a ridiculous remark!?Dahlia: Y-Yes! It's ridiculous! My sister was there to help me! She had her gun and handcuffs. She could have saved me... Jumping into a raging river like that... That would have been suicide!Mia:Mia: Perhaps... But still, that's exactly what you did! You were probably confident that you could handle the swift current. But even more so... ...the witness had a much more compelling reason for jumping into the river!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Oh? Then what was it!? What was so important that she'd want to jump into the river!?Mia: The witness is still alive. This fact alone explains everything! This is why she risked her life by jumping into the rapids of the Eagle River!Present Diamond Mia: Leads to: \"Five years ago...\"Present anything else Mia: Edgeworth: That isn't even worth a reply. Ms. Fey. I hold you personally responsible... ...for confusing the court and causing great emotional pain to the witness! Judge: I have no choice but to impose a penalty on you. Mia: (This is an easy one, Mia! What was it she was after...? Even Edgeworth must have realized it...!) Leads back to: \"The witness is still alive. This fact alone explains everything!\"Mia: Five years ago... ...something else disappeared along with Dahlia that day. The item that Valerie brought up the mountain with her... The 2 million dollar diamond!Dahlia: ...!Edgeworth: AAAAAHHH!! N... No... It-It can't be...!Mia: Yes. Dahlia had it all planned from the beginning! The 2 million dollars... She was going to keep it all for herself! She forced Mr. Fawles to help her fake the kidnapping...*BANG!*Mia: At the last minute, she betrayed him and threw herself into the river... ...with the ransom tucked away safely in her backpack...Edgeworth: Why that's... that's simply ridiculous!Judge: Order! Order! Order!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Y-Your Honor! Five years ago, the witness was only 14 years old! Do you really think a 14 year old is capable of such a demonic plan!?Mia: This woman IS a demon. And there was one more person who helped make a demon out of her. Her sister... Valerie Hawthorne.Judge: Y-You mean the victim was involved in the kidnapping plot as well!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: But she was a detective then! You're saying she participated in her sister's kidnapping!?Mia: Precisely! I'm sure that it weighed heavily on her conscience for the past 5 years. This is the sole reason behind the victim's murder.Judge: What do you mean by that?Mia: On the day of the murder... ...after receiving the phone call from Mr. Fawles, Valerie called her sister, Dahlia. And then she told her what she was planning to do.Judge: \"Planning to do\"...?Edgeworth: She was going to tell the whole truth... As she wrote in her note!Mia: THAT is what sealed Valerie Hawthorne's fate... THAT is when you hatched your demonic plan to kill two birds with one stone. A plan that would ensure neither of your accomplices to the kidnapping would talk. And THAT is why... ...you killed your sister, Valerie Hawthorne!... Hee hee...Judge: Wh-Who is that!? Laughing at a time like this!Dahlia: Forgive me. It's just hilarious...Judge: W-Witness? Is that you?Dahlia: You amuse me, woman! MS. MIA FEY...Mia: ...!Dahlia: You can certainly weave an exciting tale... Naturally... you have the evidence to back it up, don't you?Mia: Ev-Evidence...?Dahlia: Evidence that I planned the kidnapping, of course... That at 14, I plotted it with Mr. Fawles and my sister.Mia: W-Well, I...Dahlia: And one more thing. What happened to the 2 million dollar diamond? If you can't provide evidence to at least show that...Judge: Hmmmmm... Well, Ms. Fey?Mia: I... I don't know...Dahlia: What a joke. YOU, MS. FEY... Are you stupid or something?Mia: Nnrgh...! (How can I prove a fake kidnapping that happened 5 years ago!? I don't even have decisive proof of Valerie Hawthorne's murder...)Judge: Well it seems... that we've come to the end. To be honest, the witness's behavior does raise certain suspicions... However, I am forced to reject the assertions made by the defense.Dahlia: Of course you are.Mia: (Is this it...? Is it really over...? That girl has made a fool of me and there's nothing I can do about it!)Armando: Ha...! Without evidence the trial is over? Who decided that?Mia: M-Mr. Armando!Armando: Come on now, Kitten. Haven't you figured out that you can make your own rules? For example, even if there's no evidence, there's still testimony!Mia: (T-Testimony...?)Armando: On the day in question, Dahlia Hawthorne murdered her sister, Valerie Hawthorne. She hid her body in the trunk of Mr. Fawles's stolen car and then went to meet with him... ...disguised as her sister, Valerie Hawthorne. That's what you think, right?Mia: Y-Yes, that's right...Armando: In that case, there's only one answer, right? There is only one person left who can testify about Valerie Hawthorne's murder!Mia: (Since there's no proof, there's only one thing left to do! Who is the one person who can testify to that demon woman's crimes...?)Present Terry Fawles profile Mia: Leads to: \"Your Honor! The defense wishes to call a new witness!\"Present anything else Mia: Armando: Listen up. This is your last chance. Think it over carefully one more time. Mia: (Relax, Mia! This is easy...!) Leads back to: \"On the day in question, Dahlia Hawthorne murdered her sister, Valerie Hawthorne.\"Mia: Your Honor! The defense wishes to call a new witness!Judge: A new witness?Mia: Yes! We would like to hear the testimony of Terry Fawles!Edgeworth: The defendant...!?Mia: There's only one person that can shed any further light on the situation... Only one person that knows what Dahlia's role in the kidnapping was... Only one person that can say whether the person in the photo is Valerie Hawthorne... ...or whether it was in fact her younger sister Dahlia, disguised as her. There's only one person who can solve this riddle once and for all... And that person is... Terry Fawles!Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth? What is your take on this?Edgeworth: ... Why not? The prosecution has no objection.Judge: Very well. Bailiff! Bring the defendant to the witness stand!Mia: (This is my last chance, Mr. Fawles... My last chance to establish Dahlia's guilt... You're all I have left!)Judge: Defendant, you've heard everything that's been said up to this point, yes?Fawles: Uhh... Umm... I don't believe it! No way! Dahlia died! Five years ago! Valerie betrayed me!Mia: Mr. Fawles... I don't know what she said to you 5 years ago, but one thing is clear. Dahlia is very much alive. And you were used. For 2 million dollars.Fawles: That's... Not... True...Judge: Mr. Fawles. There's only one question I want the answer to. Two days ago on Dusky Bridge... who did you meet? Was it Valerie Hawthorne? Or was it Dahlia Hawthorne?Fawles: Dahlia... Dahlia... Did you... betray me? ... Five years ago she promised... She promised... Never, ever betray each other...Dahlia: Terry...Fawles: Dahlia! It-It's true! You are alive...!Dahlia: You don't trust me anymore? That makes me sad.Fawles: Tell the truth! The real truth! I... I believed in you!Dahlia: ... I shouldn't NEED to say it. You should already know...Fawles: ...!Dahlia: But... There is one thing that I WILL say. My life is in your hands right now, Terry.Fawles: Dah...lia...Judge: I will allow Mr. Fawles to testify once and once only. Well then, Mr. Fawles. Yours will be the final testimony in this trial.Fawles: ...Judge: Witness!Fawles: GAAAAAAAHHH!!!!Judge: Eeeeek! I'm sorry! I apologize!Fawles: Uwah! Uwah! UWAAAAH!! W-Water! P-Please! Water!Mia: Hmm?Fawles: Can't talk... Need water...Armando: Ha...! Oh well, I guess it'll have to be my coffee instead. At least it'll match the way he's probably feeling right now... Darker and bitterer than Hell itself.Fawles: UWAAAAAH...Witness Testimony-- Who Terry Fawles Saw --Fawles: That day... 4 PM... I stopped the car. I was in front of bridge... She wasn't there...So, I waited on bridge. I watched my car from bridge. I never put no body in that car! Finally, one woman came. She stood front of me. We talked... Then she left. That was... That was Valerie. Not my Dahlia!Mia: Mr. Fawles! You're covering for her! Do you think she would do the same for you...!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: That's enough, Ms. Fey! His last statement was a fitting way to end the final testimony of the trial...Mia: ...!Judge: Well then, Ms. Fey... Please proceed with your cross-examination.Mia: (Is this how you want it to end, Mr. Fawles? Another guilty verdict to go along with your death sentence!?)Armando: There's only one person who can stop it... You, Kitten. ...I think.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Who Terry Fawles Saw --Fawles: That day... 4 PM... I stopped the car. I was in front of bridge...Press Mia: Mia: According to the note, the meeting was supposed to take place at 4:30. You certainly arrived early, didn't you? Fawles: It was raining... Already dark, too... Mia: You waited on the bridge for 30 minutes? Fawles: ... Mia: Mr. Fawles...? Fawles: Eagle Mountain... That spot... Strong, strong memories... Mia: ... (Why did he just clam up? Could it be... he's hiding something here?)Fawles: She wasn't there... So, I waited on bridge.Press Mia: Mia: You were quite early, so you waited on the bridge, correct? Fawles: Yeah... I like waiting. I'm used to it. Armando: I'm sure he is. Zebra Boy waited 5 years to ask a single question... To find out why a woman betrayed him. To him, 30 minutes must've been like a blink of the eye.Present Witness's Photo Mia: Leads to: \"So when you got to the bridge, no one had arrived, huh?\"Fawles: I watched my car from bridge. I never put no body in that car!Press Mia: Mia: You were watching the car? Fawles: That bridge. Other side is broken. Nobody can come from there. So... I was watching car. Edgeworth: *sigh*... What else were you expecting him to do...? Mia: (I suppose that's the obvious thing to do, but... ...something's bothering me. I'm getting that feeling... A contradiction?) Judge: I wonder what's on the other side of the broken bridge anyway? Edgeworth: No one lives there. There's a small shrine up on the mountain, but that's it... Fawles: Anyway...! Nobody came... No car, nothing!Present Witness's Photo Mia: Leads to: \"So when you got to the bridge, no one had arrived, huh?\"Fawles: Finally, one woman came. She stood front of me.Press Mia: Mia: Mr. Fawles. Think carefully now. Are you certain that it was Valerie Hawthorne? Fawles: Uh. Uh. Uh... I never lie! It-It's the truth! It was... Valerie! I remembered her face! Mia: Wait a minute. If you had remembered her face... ...then why did you make her wear a scarf as identification? Fawles: ... Uh. Sorry. I told a little lie. Mia: ...... Fawles: But! The woman I met... She was different from woman standing here now! She was different! It was Valerie!Present Witness's Photo Mia: Leads to: \"So when you got to the bridge, no one had arrived, huh?\"Fawles: We talked... Then she left.Press Mia: Mia: What did you talk to her about anyway? Fawles: ... Mia: Mr. Fawles! Fawles: Valerie told the truth. About the kidnapping 5 years ago. She said, \"Someone needed to take the blame for it... That was all I could think to do.\" She said that. That's why she lied... Got me the death penalty... Edgeworth: And were you satisfied with that answer, witness? Fawles: Dahlia died... It was my fault. But I don't really remember... Maybe I did... Maybe I did push her in... Mia: ...! Fawles: It don't matter no more... Either way... My Dahlia... My sweet Teen Angel... Dead. Mia: (But you just saw that she isn't dead!) Fawles: After Valerie talk to me on bridge... Nothing left to live for...Present Witness's Photo Mia: Leads to: \"So when you got to the bridge, no one had arrived, huh?\"Fawles: That was... That was Valerie. Not my Dahlia!Press Mia: Mia: How can you be so sure!? It was raining at the time, and sunset that day was at 5 o'clock. It would have already been pretty dark on that mountain at 4:30! Fawles: ... Mia: Please Mr. Fawles! This is your last chance! You've already taken the fall once for something you didn't do! Fawles: ... That woman... It wasn't Dahlia. Edgeworth: Stop right there! What more needs to be said!? Judge: Hmmmmm. Mia: (Even if it means the death penalty. Even if it means taking the blame for murder... You'll still do whatever is necessary to protect her... Won't you, Mr. Fawles?)Armando: I know it's obvious, but... he's clearly lying. He's been cursed... by Dahlia Hawthorne. He'll probably go to his grave still believing in her.Mia: Mr. Fawles...Armando: Even if you can show he's lying, the poor guy will still be cursed... You'll still have to point out the contradiction anyway. That's the curse of being a defense lawyer, I guess...\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Terry Fawles\nDescription: My client.

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}.

    "response_json": {
      "evidence": 6,
      "testimony": 3
    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. The user wants one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a specific testimony. Let's start by reviewing the testimonies from Terry Fawles and the evidence provided.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Fawles claims in Testimony 3: \"Finally, one woman came. She stood front of me.\" He insists that the woman he met was Valerie, not Dahlia. But we know from earlier in the story that Dahlia was posing as Valerie. The key here is whether the woman he saw could have been Dahlia in disguise.\n\nNow, checking the evidence, the Witness's Photo (Evidence 6) shows the victim (Valerie) wearing a scarf and a hat, standing near the broken end of the bridge. However, the actual Scarf (Evidence 5) is blue, not white. The Victim's Note (Evidence 3) instructed Valerie to wear a white scarf for identification, but the scarf in the photo isn't white. This discrepancy suggests that the person in the photo wasn't Valerie but Dahlia, who knew about the note and thus mentioned the white scarf, even though the real scarf was blue. \n\nBut wait, how does this tie into Fawles' testimony? Fawles says he met Valerie, but if the photo shows someone wearing a blue scarf (not white as per the note), that person might actually be Dahlia pretending to be Valerie. However, Fawles' testimony that he saw Valerie is contradicted by the photo's evidence of the scarf color. However, the direct contradiction to Fawles' testimony about the woman being Valerie would be the Witness's Photo, which shows the scarf color. Alternatively, maybe the camera's timer function (Evidence 7) could be involved, but the main point is the scarf color.\n\nWait, Fawles says he met Valerie, but the photo taken by Melissa (Dahlia) shows Valerie with a blue scarf. But the note said white. So Melissa (Dahlia) took the photo, but she knew the note said white, which is why she mentioned the white scarf in her testimony. However, the actual scarf in the photo is blue, proving that the person in the photo (Valerie) wasn't wearing white, meaning the meeting was with someone else (Dahlia) who knew the note's content. Therefore, Fawles' testimony that he met Valerie is contradicted by the Witness's Photo showing the blue scarf, indicating it was actually Dahlia in disguise. \n\nSo the contradiction is between Fawles' testimony (Testimony 3) that he met Valerie and the Witness's Photo (Evidence 6) showing the victim with a blue scarf, not white as the note instructed. This implies the woman in the photo wasn't Valerie but Dahlia, contradicting Fawles' claim. Therefore, the evidence is the Witness's Photo (6) and the testimony is Testimony 3."

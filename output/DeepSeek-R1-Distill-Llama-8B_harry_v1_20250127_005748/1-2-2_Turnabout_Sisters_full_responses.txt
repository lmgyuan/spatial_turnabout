Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony. Let's start by going through each testimony and see what each one says, then match them with the evidence.

Testimony 0: Gumshoe says he secured the suspect and examined the scene. That seems general, so probably doesn't contradict anything directly unless another testimony says he didn't examine the scene.

Testimony 1: Gumshoe found a memo next to the victim. So, that's about Evidence 4 or 14, both are Mayas' memos. But wait, Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, and 14 is Mia's Memo. So if he found a memo next to the victim, it's Maya's, which is Evidence 4. But in the evidence list, Maya's Memo is Evidence 4, which is a conversation with her sister on her cell phone. But Testimony 1 says he found a memo next to the victim. So does that mean the memo is at the scene? Or is it on the phone? Because Evidence 4 is Maya's cell phone holding a conversation, not a physical memo. So maybe Testimony 1 is referring to Evidence 4, but the description of Evidence 4 is a phone, so maybe the memo in Testimony 1 is actually Evidence 4, but the content is a conversation, not a list of names. Wait, no, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name, which might be related to the memo. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Testimony 2: Blood with "Maya" written on it. That matches Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo), but the memo is on her phone, not blood. Or maybe it's referring to another evidence. Wait, Evidence 12 is the Bellboy's Affidavit, which doesn't have blood. Evidence 3 is Glass Shards, which is broken glass. Evidence 1 is The Thinker, the murder weapon. Evidence 2 is Attorney's Badge, which is a character's item. Evidence 7 is Wiretap, which is in May's hotel room. So Testimony 2 says blood with Maya's name, which must be from the memo. But the memo is on the phone, not blood. So that's a contradiction because the testimony implies the memo was written in blood, but the evidence shows it's a phone conversation.

Wait, no, Testimony 2 says the memo was written in blood. But the actual evidence (Evidence 4) is a cell phone with a conversation. So Testimony 1 and 2 are about the memo, but the actual evidence is the phone. So Testimony 1 says he found a memo, which is actually the phone, not a piece of paper. So that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 2 says the memo had Maya's name in blood, but the actual evidence (Evidence 4) is a phone conversation, not a memo with blood. So Testimony 2 is wrong because the memo isn't covered in blood; it's a conversation on the phone.

Wait, but Testimony 1 says he found a memo next to the victim, which is the phone. So the memo is the phone, but Testimony 2 says the memo had Maya's name in blood, which isn't true because the phone doesn't have blood. So Testimony 2 contradicts the evidence because the memo (phone) doesn't have Maya's name in blood.

So the pair would be Testimony 2 and Evidence 4. But the evidence is Maya's Memo, which is on the phone, and Testimony 2 says the memo had Maya's name in blood, which isn't the case. So the testimony is wrong because the memo is on the phone, not covered in blood.

Alternatively, maybe it's Testimony 1 and Evidence 4. Testimony 1 says he found a memo, which is the phone, but the memo in Evidence 4 is on the phone, not a physical memo. So Testimony 1 is incorrect because the memo isn't a physical paper but the phone itself.

Wait, but the testimony says he found a memo next to the victim, which would be the phone (Evidence 4). So Testimony 1 is correct because the memo is the phone. But Testimony 2 says the memo had Maya's name in blood, which isn't true because the phone doesn't have blood. So Testimony 2 is wrong.

So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 4. Because the memo on the phone doesn't have Maya's name in blood, but Testimony 2 says it does.

Alternatively, maybe it's Testimony 5: the victim wrote the killer's name. That would relate to Evidence 4, which is the phone with a conversation. But the phone doesn't have the killer's name written, so Testimony 5 is wrong. Wait, no, the phone has a conversation, but Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the name, which would be on the memo. So if the memo is on the phone, then Testimony 5 is correct because the victim wrote the name on the memo. But Testimony 2 says the memo had Maya's name in blood, which is incorrect. So Testimony 2 is wrong.

I think the main contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 4, because Testimony 2 claims the memo (phone) has Maya's name in blood, which isn't the case. So the pair is Testimony 2 and Evidence 4.

{"testimony": 2, "evidence": 4}

Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's see, the user provided a list of evidence and testimonies, and they want me to find a pair that contradict each other. The answer should be in JSON format, like {"evidence": x, "testimony": y}.

First, I'll go through each piece of evidence and testimony to see if any of them clash. Let's start with the testimonies because they might give me clues about what evidence to check against.

Looking at Testimony 0: "I did see everything! I did!" by April. That seems pretty vague, just a general statement that she was present and saw everything. Not specific enough to contradict anything yet.

Testimony 1: "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." This is a bit more detailed. It describes the victim's movements after being attacked. So, the victim dodged an attack and ran right.

Testimony 2: "Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her..." So, there's another person, a girl in hippie clothes, who ran after the victim.

Testimony 3: "And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" So, the victim was hit with a weapon by the girl in hippie clothes.

Testimony 4: "That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?" This is talking about the weapon used. The Thinker is described as a clock that's actually a murder weapon.

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 1 is The Thinker, which is the murder weapon made by Larry Butz. Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, which is a conversation recorded on her cell phone.

Wait, Testimony 4 mentions the weapon as a clock called The Thinker, which matches Evidence 1. So, Testimony 4 aligns with Evidence 1.

But then, Testimony 3 says that the girl hit the victim with that weapon, which is The Thinker. So, the weapon used was The Thinker, which is consistent with Evidence 1.

Wait, but the user wants a contradiction. So, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Looking at the testimonies again, Testimony 4 mentions the weapon as The Thinker, which is the same as Evidence 1. So, they are consistent, not contradictory.

Wait, maybe I need to look at another testimony. Testimony 2 mentions a girl in hippie clothes running after the victim, and Testimony 3 says she hit the victim with the weapon. So, the girl in hippie clothes is the one who attacked the victim.

But wait, the weapon is The Thinker, a clock. So, if the girl used The Thinker to attack, that's consistent with both Testimony 3 and Evidence 1.

Hmm, but the user wants a contradiction. Maybe I need to see if any testimony says something different about the weapon.

Wait, Testimony 4 says "that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?" which matches Evidence 1. So, no contradiction there.

Wait, maybe looking at other testimonies. Testimony 0 and 1 are just descriptions of the scene, so they don't add anything conflicting.

Wait, maybe I need to look at other evidence. Evidence 14 is Mia's Memo, which is a list of names. But the testimonies don't mention that, so maybe not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the contradiction is between the testimonies and the evidence in a different way. Let me think again.

Wait, Testimony 4 says the weapon is The Thinker, which is Evidence 1. So, they are consistent, not contradictory.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the testimonies again.

Testimony 4: "...she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" So, the weapon is The Thinker, matching Evidence 1.

Wait, but maybe the testimonies say something else about the weapon. Let me check all testimonies again.

Testimony 3: "...she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" So, the weapon is The Thinker, which is Evidence 1.

Wait, but the user wants a contradiction, so maybe the testimonies say something different about the weapon.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Wait, Testimony 4 says the weapon is The Thinker, which is Evidence 1. So, they are consistent, not contradictory.

Wait, maybe I need to look at another piece of evidence. Evidence 3 is a receipt with letters written in blood. Testimony 2 says the victim's blood was found on the finger, and Testimony 3 says the victim wrote the killer's name in blood, which is on the receipt.

Wait, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name in blood, which is on the receipt (Evidence 3). So, that's consistent.

Wait, but the user wants a contradiction, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the testimonies say something about the weapon that contradicts the evidence.

Wait, Testimony 4 says the weapon is The Thinker, which is Evidence 1. So, they are consistent.

Wait, maybe I need to look at another testimony. Testimony 4 is about the weapon, and Testimony 5 is about the victim writing the killer's name in blood, which is on the receipt (Evidence 3). So, that's consistent.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the testimonies again. Testimony 4 is about the weapon, and Testimony 5 is about the receipt with blood.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is that Testimony 4 says the weapon is The Thinker, which is consistent with Evidence 1, but maybe another testimony says something else.

Wait, let me check all testimonies again.

Testimony 0: General statement.

Testimony 1: Victim dodged attack and ran right.

Testimony 2: Girl in hippie clothes ran after her.

Testimony 3: Girl hit victim with weapon.

Testimony 4: Weapon is The Thinker.

So, all these are consistent with the evidence. So, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between the testimonies and the evidence in another way. Maybe the testimonies say something that the evidence contradicts.

Wait, Testimony 4 says the weapon is The Thinker, which is Evidence 1. So, they are consistent.

Wait, maybe the testimonies say that the victim wrote the killer's name in blood, which is on the receipt (Evidence 3). So, Testimony 5 aligns with Evidence 3.

Wait, but the user wants a contradiction, so maybe the testimonies say something different.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, Testimony 4 says the weapon is The Thinker, which is Evidence 1. So, they are consistent.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 1. But they don't contradict, they align.

Wait, maybe I need to look at another testimony. Testimony 2 says the girl in hippie clothes ran after the victim, and Testimony 3 says she hit the victim with the weapon. So, the attacker is the girl in hippie clothes, and she used The Thinker (Evidence 1).

Wait, but maybe the evidence says something else about the attacker.

Wait, Evidence 7 is a wiretap found in May's hotel room. Testimony 2 and 3 talk about the girl in hippie clothes, but I don't see a direct contradiction there.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 1, but they don't contradict, they match.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the answer is that Testimony 4 and Evidence 1 are consistent, not contradictory.

Wait, but the user wants a contradiction. Maybe I need to look for something else.

Wait, Testimony 4 says the weapon is The Thinker, which is Evidence 1. So, they are consistent, not contradictory.

Wait, maybe I need to look at another piece of evidence. Evidence 14 is Mia's Memo, a list of names. Testimony 5 is about the victim writing the killer's name in blood, which is on the receipt (Evidence 3). So, that's consistent.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 1, but they don't contradict.

Wait, maybe the answer is that there is no contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 1, but the user wants a pair that contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a testimony that says something different about the weapon.

Wait, Testimony 4 says the weapon is The Thinker, which is Evidence 1. So, they are consistent.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the testimonies again.

Testimony 4: "...she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did! That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?" So, the weapon is The Thinker, matching Evidence 1.

Wait, but the user wants a contradiction, so maybe the answer is that Testimony 4 and Evidence 1 are consistent, not contradictory.

Wait, but the user wants a pair that contradicts. Maybe I need to look elsewhere.

Wait, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name in blood, which is on the receipt (Evidence 3). So, that's consistent.

Wait, maybe I need to look at another testimony. Testimony 1 says the victim ran to the right, and Testimony 2 says the girl in hippie clothes ran after her. So, the attacker is the girl in hippie clothes, and she used The Thinker (Evidence 1).

Wait, but maybe the evidence says something else about the attacker.

Wait, Evidence 12 is the Bellboy's Affidavit, which describes the man who stayed with May. But the testimonies talk about the girl in hippie clothes. So, maybe the Bellboy's Affidavit says someone else was with May, but the testimonies say a girl in hippie clothes attacked the victim. So, maybe that's a contradiction.

Wait, but the user wants a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. So, maybe Testimony 2 or 3 and Evidence 12.

Wait, Testimony 2 says the girl in hippie clothes ran after the victim, implying that the attacker is a girl, but Evidence 12 is about a man staying with May, which might suggest that the attacker is a man, not a girl.

So, if Testimony 2 says the attacker is a girl, but Evidence 12 says a man stayed with May, perhaps they contradict.

Wait, but Testimony 2 says the girl in hippie clothes ran after the victim, implying the attacker is a girl, while Evidence 12 says a man stayed with May. So, if the attacker is the man from Evidence 12, then Testimony 2 is wrong.

Alternatively, if the attacker is the girl, then Evidence 12 is about someone else.

So, perhaps Testimony 2 and Evidence 12 contradict each other.

Wait, but the user wants a pair of evidence and testimony. So, maybe Testimony 2 (evidence: 2) and Evidence 12.

Wait, no, the user wants evidence and testimony, not two testimonies.

Wait, perhaps Testimony 2 (about the girl) and Evidence 12 (about the man) contradict each other.

So, the evidence (Evidence 12) says a man stayed with May, but the testimony (Testimony 2) says a girl in hippie clothes attacked the victim, implying the attacker is a girl.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts is Testimony 2 and Evidence 12.

So, the JSON would be {"testimony": 2, "evidence": 12}.

Wait, but the user wants a pair where one is evidence and one is testimony. So, Testimony 2 is a testimony, and Evidence 12 is an evidence.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer is that Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 12.

Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this list. Let me go through each evidence and testimony and see where they clash.

Starting with Testimony 0 from Gumshoe: He says Mask☆DeMasque is a master thief who started his crime spree 6 months ago. Looking at the evidence, Evidence 20 is Ron's testimony, which says that DeMasque started stealing as directed by blackmail letters from his second heist onwards. So if DeMasque started 6 months ago, that would mean his second heist was 4 months ago. But Ron's testimony says he started from the second heist, so maybe the timing is off. Or perhaps Testimony 0 is from before Ron's testimony, making them both correct but from different sources. Hmm, not sure if they contradict yet.

Testimony 1: He sends his calling card before committing the crime. Evidence 5 is the DeMasque's Calling Card, which was sent before a heist. So they support each other, not contradicting.

Testimony 2: His fifth heist was on Lordly Tailor. Evidence 6 is the Shichishito, which was used in the fifth heist. So Testimony 2 and Evidence 6 align.

Testimony 3: He goes after the most precious art pieces. Evidence 3 is the Ami Fey's Golden Statue, which is an artifact. So Testimony 3 and Evidence 3 fit.

Testimony 4: His MO fits, so it's him. Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn, which was stolen. So Testimony 4 and Evidence 4 are okay.

Now, looking at the testimonies again, Testimony 0 says he started 6 months ago, while Evidence 20 (Ron's testimony) says he started from his second heist. If the second heist was, say, 4 months ago, then Testimony 0 would be incorrect. But maybe the timeline is that he started 6 months ago, so his second heist was 5 months ago. So Testimony 0 and Evidence 20 both fit. So they don't contradict.

Wait, but Evidence 20 says that from his second heist onwards, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters. Testimony 0 says he started 6 months ago. So if the second heist was, say, 5 months ago, then he started 6 months ago, making Testimony 0 correct. So no contradiction.

Wait, but the user wants only one pair. Let me check other testimonies.

Testimony 1 matches Evidence 5, so no issue.

Testimony 2 matches Evidence 6, so okay.

Testimony 3 matches Evidence 3.

Testimony 4 matches Evidence 4.

Now, looking at other testimonies: Testimony 0 and 1, 2, 3, 4 all come from Gumshoe. So maybe another testimony from a different character.

Wait, the user's question says "evidence/character and testimony" that contradict. So perhaps a testimony from a different person contradicting an evidence.

Looking at Testimony 0: Gumshoe says he started 6 months ago. Evidence 20: Ron's testimony says from his second heist. So if Ron's testimony is that he started from the second heist, which would mean he had at least one heist before that. So if Testimony 0 says he started 6 months ago, that would mean his first heist was 6 months ago, and the second was 5 months ago. But Ron's testimony says he started from the second heist, implying the first heist wasn't part of the crime spree. So maybe Testimony 0 is incorrect because he only started from the second heist, not 6 months ago.

Alternatively, maybe Testimony 0 is correct, and Ron's testimony is that from the second heist onwards, he was stealing because of blackmail. So both could be true.

Wait, but the user wants a contradiction. Let me think again.

Testimony 0: He started 6 months ago.

Evidence 20: He started from his second heist, which would be 4 months ago if the total is 6 months. So Testimony 0 would be wrong because he started 6 months ago, but Ron's testimony says he started from the second heist, which would mean his first heist was before that. So Testimony 0 and Evidence 20 contradict.

Alternatively, maybe Testimony 0 is correct, and Ron's testimony is that he started from the second heist, but that could mean he started his crime spree with the second heist, making the total 6 months. So maybe they are consistent.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure it.

Testimony 0: He started 6 months ago.

Evidence 20: From his second heist onwards, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters.

So if he started 6 months ago, that would mean his first heist was 6 months ago, second 5 months ago, third 4, etc. But Evidence 20 says from the second heist, so Testimony 0 is correct in that he started 6 months ago, and Evidence 20 is about the method from the second heist onwards. So they don't contradict.

Wait, but maybe Testimony 0 is from someone else, like Gumshoe, and Evidence 20 is from Ron. So both are correct, but Testimony 0 says he started 6 months ago, and Evidence 20 says he started from the second heist, which would be 5 months ago if the total is 6 months. So Testimony 0 would be wrong because he didn't start 6 months ago, but started 5 months ago. Or perhaps Testimony 0 is correct, and Evidence 20 is about the method, not the timing. So maybe Testimony 0 is correct, and Evidence 20 is correct, so they don't contradict.

Hmm, maybe I need to look elsewhere. Let's check other testimonies.

Testimony 5: Not mentioned here, but looking at the list, the testimonies are 0-4, so perhaps another angle.

Wait, the user wants evidence and testimony that contradict. So perhaps a testimony from a different person.

Wait, looking at Testimony 0: Gumshoe says he started 6 months ago.

Evidence 20: Ron's testimony that from DeMasque's second heist onwards, he was stealing because of blackmail.

So if the second heist was 5 months ago, then Testimony 0 would be incorrect because he started 6 months ago. But if Testimony 0 is correct, then Evidence 20 is correct as well. So they don't contradict.

Alternatively, maybe Testimony 0 is wrong because he started earlier.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think of another pair.

Testimony 1: He sends a calling card before the crime.

Evidence 5: The calling card was sent before the heist.

So they support each other, not contradicting.

Testimony 2: Fifth heist on Lordly Tailor.

Evidence 6: Shichishito was used in the fifth heist.

So they align.

Testimony 3: He goes after precious art pieces.

Evidence 3: Ami Fey's statue, which is an artifact.

So they align.

Testimony 4: His MO fits.

Evidence 4: Sacred Urn was stolen.

So they align.

Testimony 0 and Evidence 20: Maybe they don't contradict.

Wait, perhaps another testimony. Let me check.

Testimony 5: Not in the list. The testimonies are 0-4.

Wait, maybe another angle. Let me look at the evidence again.

Evidence 12: Key card for CEO office. Found in Ron's wallet.

Testimony 20: Ron's testimony about the heists.

So perhaps Testimony 20 says DeMasque used the key card from Ron's wallet. So Testimony 20 and Evidence 12 are consistent.

Wait, but the user wants a contradiction. So perhaps a testimony that says he didn't use the key card, but evidence says he did.

Wait, no, the testimonies are all from Gumshoe except Testimony 0, which is from Gumshoe as well.

Wait, perhaps Testimony 0 is wrong because he didn't start 6 months ago, but started earlier. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Testimony 0 is correct, and Evidence 20 is correct, so no contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 20. If Testimony 0 says he started 6 months ago, but Evidence 20 says he started from the second heist, which would mean he had a first heist before that. So Testimony 0 would be incorrect because he didn't start 6 months ago, but started earlier.

Alternatively, if Testimony 0 is correct, then Evidence 20 is about the method, not the timing.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find a direct contradiction.

Testimony 0: He started 6 months ago.

Evidence 20: From his second heist onwards, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters.

So if Testimony 0 is correct, he started 6 months ago, so his second heist was 5 months ago. Evidence 20 is correct because he started from the second heist. So they don't contradict.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 20 because Testimony 0 says he started 6 months ago, implying that his first heist was 6 months ago, but Evidence 20 says he started from the second heist, implying that his first heist wasn't part of the crime spree. So Testimony 0 would be wrong because he didn't start 6 months ago, but started from the second heist.

So Testimony 0 (from Gumshoe) contradicts Evidence 20 (Ron's testimony).

Alternatively, maybe Testimony 0 is correct, and Evidence 20 is correct as well, so no contradiction.

I think the intended answer is that Testimony 0 and Evidence 20 contradict because Testimony 0 says he started 6 months ago, while Evidence 20 says he started from the second heist, implying that his first heist wasn't part of the crime spree. So Testimony 0 is incorrect because he didn't start 6 months ago, but started from the second heist.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is Testimony 0 and Evidence 20 contradict because Testimony 0 says he started 6 months ago, while Evidence 20 says he started from the second heist, which would mean he started earlier. So Testimony 0 is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe Testimony 0 is correct, and Evidence 20 is about the method, not the timing.

I think the intended answer is that Testimony 0 and Evidence 20 contradict because Testimony 0 states that he started 6 months ago, while Evidence 20 says he started from the second heist, implying that he had a first heist before that, which would mean he started before 6 months ago.

So the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 20.

Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence or character contradicts which testimony. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to look at the testimonies and see what each one is saying. Testimony 0 says it was around 1 o'clock in the morning, just after the date changed. Testimony 1 mentions Mask☆DeMasque descending upon Atmey. Testimony 2 says Atmey was struck before he could react, and testimony 3 says he was knocked out and when he woke up, DeMasque was gone. Testimony 4 mentions that Atmey called the police 30 minutes later.

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 7 is the Camera Data, which shows the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. That would align with the time in Testimony 0. But Testimony 1 says DeMasque attacked Atmey around that time, which would fit the camera data. However, Testimony 3 says Atmey was knocked out, but the camera data might show DeMasque was there at 1 AM, which is consistent with both the time and the attack.

Wait, but Testimony 4 says Atmey called the police 30 minutes later, which would be around 1:30 AM. But Evidence 19 is the Buzzer Record, showing the CEO's office buzzer went off at 1:02 AM. That's a bit confusing because if the attack was at 1 AM, the buzzer record at 1:02 AM might suggest DeMasque was still there or doing something else, which could contradict if it's supposed to be after the attack.

Alternatively, maybe Testimony 4 is conflicting with Evidence 19. If the attack happened around 1 AM, the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM, which is just after. But Testimony 4 says Atmey called the police 30 minutes later, which would be around 1:30 AM. That seems consistent because the buzzer record is at 1:02 AM, and Atmey called the police at 1:30. So maybe that's not a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Testimony 4 says he called the police 30 minutes after the attack, which would be 1:30 AM. But Evidence 19 shows the buzzer was activated at 1:02 AM, which is just two minutes after the attack time. So the police would have been notified at 1:30, but the buzzer was pressed at 1:02. That doesn't directly contradict because the buzzer record is about the time it was pressed, not the time of the attack.

Hmm, maybe I should look for a more direct contradiction. Let's consider the timing again. Testimony 4 says he called the police 30 minutes after the attack, which would be around 1:30 AM. But Evidence 19 shows the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, which is 28 minutes after the attack. That's very close but not exactly 30 minutes. Maybe that's a slight inconsistency, but it's not a major contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 3 says Atmey was knocked out and when he woke up, DeMasque was gone. So the attack happened, Atmey was out, and DeMasque left. But Evidence 19 shows the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, which is after the attack, suggesting DeMasque was still there. That could mean that DeMasque didn't leave immediately, which contradicts Testimony 3.

So, maybe Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record) and Testimony 3 are contradicting each other because the buzzer record shows DeMasque was still in the CEO's office at 1:02 AM, implying he didn't leave right away, while Testimony 3 says he was gone when Atmey woke up.

Wait, but Testimony 3 doesn't specify the exact time DeMasque left. It just says he was gone when Atmey woke up. If the attack was at 1 AM, and the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, that's only two minutes later, which might mean DeMasque was still there. So that could mean he didn't leave immediately, which contradicts the testimony that he was gone when Atmey woke up.

I think that's the contradiction. Evidence 19 shows DeMasque was still present in the CEO's office at 1:02 AM, which is a few minutes after the attack, suggesting he didn't leave right away, which contradicts Testimony 3 stating he was gone when Atmey woke up.

So, the pair that contradicts would be Evidence 19 and Testimony 3.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts which testimony in this case. There's a lot of information here, so I need to go through it step by step.

First, I'll list out all the evidence and testimonies to get a clear picture. The evidence includes things like the Attorney's Badge, Maya's Magatama, Treasure Exhibit Poster, and so on, each with their own descriptions. Then, there are testimonies from different characters like Atmey, Gumshoe, and others, each giving their accounts of what happened.

I need to find a pair where one piece of evidence or character directly contradicts a testimony. That means I'm looking for something that can't both be true at the same time.

Starting with the testimonies, let's look at Testimony 4 from Atmey. It says, "His first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote." This suggests that Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque's first hit, implying that DeMasque was the one who delivered the final blow.

Now, looking at the evidence, I see that there's an autopsy report (Evidence 15) that states the cause of death was cerebral hemorrhaging from blunt trauma to the head, and the time of death was 10/12 at 1 AM. So, the time of death aligns with the camera data (Evidence 7), which also shows the camera went off at around 1 AM on the night of the crime.

But how does this relate to the testimonies? Well, Testimony 3 from Atmey says, "A true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough." This implies that Atmey tried to fight DeMasque but couldn't win, which aligns with the fact that DeMasque delivered a fatal blow.

However, Testimony 4 seems to suggest that DeMasque was the one who delivered the final blow, which matches the evidence that the cause of death was a blow to the head. But wait, the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows that the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM, which is just after the time of death according to the autopsy report. That might indicate that the buzzer was triggered by DeMasque entering the CEO's office, but if the time of death is 1 AM, and the buzzer was at 1:02 AM, that seems off by a minute, which could be a discrepancy.

Alternatively, maybe the time of death is approximate, and the buzzer record is just a timing error. But that's more of a technical issue rather than a contradiction between evidence and testimony.

Looking back, Testimony 4 says that Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque's first blow, which would mean that DeMasque acted quickly and effectively. The evidence supports that the time of death was around 1 AM, and the Buzzer Record shows DeMasque was in the CEO's office at 1:02 AM, which is just after the time of death. That suggests that DeMasque was there, and perhaps he left after the crime, but the time might not directly contradict the testimony.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that Testimony 4 says that Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque's first blow, which matches the evidence that the cause of death was a blow to the head. So, they don't contradict each other. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.

Perhaps I should look at another testimony. Let's check Testimony 2 from Atmey: "Unfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless." This suggests that the thief (DeMasque) used a weapon, which contradicts the evidence that the Shichishito wasn't bent before the crime (Evidence 6). If the Shichishito was used as a weapon and wasn't bent, that's a contradiction because using it as a weapon should have caused some damage.

Wait, but the Shichishito was held in Ami Fey's statue, and it wasn't bent, which suggests it wasn't used in the crime. So if Testimony 2 says that the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and rendered Atmey senseless, but the evidence says that the Shichishito wasn't used, then Testimony 2 is incorrect.

But which testimony is it? Testimony 2 is from Atmey, so that would mean Atmey is lying or mistaken. But I'm supposed to find a contradiction between evidence and testimony, not between testimonies.

Alternatively, maybe the weapon wasn't the Shichishito but something else. But since the Shichishito wasn't bent, it wasn't used, so Testimony 2 is incorrect in saying that the thief used a weapon from the side. Therefore, Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 6.

But the user's previous answer was about Testimony 4 and Evidence 19. Let me check that again.

Testimony 4 says that Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque's first blow, which is consistent with the autopsy report showing a blow to the head causing death. The Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows that the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM, which is after the time of death. This might suggest that DeMasque was in the CEO's office at 1:02 AM, but since the time of death was 1 AM, it's possible that DeMasque was there before the crime, or perhaps the timing is off.

However, this isn't a direct contradiction because the evidence supports that DeMasque was in the CEO's office at that time, which could be related to the crime. So, Testimony 4 doesn't contradict Evidence 19.

Therefore, the correct pair is Testimony 2 contradicting Evidence 6, as Testimony 2 claims that a weapon was used, but Evidence 6 states that the Shichishito wasn't bent, implying it wasn't used.
</think>

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}
<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony here. So, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 says that Ron claims to be Mask☆DeMasque. He says, "The truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!" So he's basically admitting to being the thief.

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 20 is Ron's Testimony, which says that from DeMasque's second heist onwards, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters. This seems to support the idea that DeMasque was involved in heists, including the one involving the Sacred Urn.

But wait, Testimony 0 is Ron claiming to be DeMasque. However, Evidence 20 is Ron's testimony about DeMasque's actions, not his own. That might not directly contradict. Let me check other testimonies.

Testimony 2 says Ron doesn't have an alibi for the night of the urn theft. Evidence 15 is Kane's Autopsy Report, which shows the time of death was 10/12 at 1 AM. So if the theft happened around that time, Ron doesn't have an alibi, which could support his guilt.

But the main point is Testimony 0 where Ron claims to be DeMasque. However, in the evidence list, there's no direct evidence that Ron was actually at the crime scene or that he used DeMasque's calling card or anything that ties him directly to the theft. So maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and the fact that DeMasque's calling card wasn't found on Ron, but instead, Evidence 5 is DeMasque's Calling Card, which was sent before the heist but wasn't found on Ron. So if Ron is claiming to be DeMasque, but the calling card wasn't found on him, that could be a contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 0 says Ron is DeMasque, but Evidence 20 is his testimony about DeMasque's actions, not his own. So maybe that's not the direct contradiction. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 0 is Ron claiming to be DeMasque, but the evidence shows that the DeMasque's Calling Card was sent before the heist, but wasn't found on Ron. So if Ron is DeMasque, the calling card should be with him, but it's not. That's a contradiction.

So the evidence (Evidence 5) and Testimony 0 contradict each other because if Ron is DeMasque, the calling card should be in his possession, but it's not found.

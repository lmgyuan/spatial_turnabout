Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me go through everything step by step.

First, I'll list out all the evidence and testimonies to understand what each one says.

Evidence 0: Attorney's Badge. It's mentioned that no one would believe the person is a defense attorney without it. So, this implies that the person is a defense attorney, maybe using this badge to gain trust or something.

Evidence 1: Popper. It's a party noisemaker that goes "bang" when pulled. Not very useful for clues.

Evidence 2: Lotta's Camera. Automatically takes a picture when a loud noise is detected, facing the lake. So, it's set up to catch any sounds and take a photo. Important for evidence.

Evidence 3: Autopsy Report of Robert. Time of death was around the 24th or 25th, cause was a bullet to the heart. So, Robert was killed around that time.

Evidence 4: Lake Photo. Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click here for details. So, this photo was taken at the time of the murder, maybe capturing something.

Evidence 5: Gourdy Article. Article about a monster sighted at Gourd Lake. Click for details. Maybe a distraction or part of the case.

Evidence 6: Misty Fey's Photo. An old photograph with "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A" written on the back. So, it's related to a previous incident.

Evidence 7: Edgeworth's Request. Document proving Edgeworth's request for an attorney. So, Edgeworth was seeking legal help, maybe related to the murder.

Evidence 8: Overhead Map. Click for details. It's an overhead map of Gourd Lake, probably showing locations related to the case.

Evidence 9: Pistol Bullet. Found in the victim's body, fired from a 22-caliber pistol. So, this is the murder weapon.

Evidence 10: Pistol. The murder weapon, 22-caliber, fired 3 times, with Edgeworth's right hand prints. So, Edgeworth used this pistol to kill Robert.

Evidence 11: Lotta's Deposition. She heard two gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. So, she's a witness to the murder.

Evidence 12: Missile. It's a K-9 unit in training, very cute with shiny eyes. Not sure how this relates yet.

Evidence 13: Fishing Pole. Detective Gumshoe's personal fishing pole, flimsy and not useful.

Evidence 14: Metal Detector. Makes noise near metallic objects, useful for detecting things like weapons.

Evidence 15: Air Tank. Empty, valve open, flags wrapped around it. Not sure yet.

Evidence 16: Second Lake Photo. Empty lake, taken 12/24 at 11:50 PM. So, this was taken the night before the murder.

Evidence 17: Parrot. Companion of the boat rental shop caretaker, named Polly. Maybe a witness or just a character.

Evidence 18: DL-6 Case File. File on the DL-6 Incident. Probably related to the previous case.

Evidence 19: DL-6 Incident Photo. Photo of the murder scene. Important evidence.

Evidence 20: Letter from the Safe. "Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth." Sets up the murder, detailing the setup.

Evidence 21: DL-6 Bullet. Taken from Gregory Edgeworth's heart, with ballistic markings. So, this is the bullet used in the murder.

Now, the testimonies:

Testimony 0: Person: Butz. "That night, I was out in a boat on the lake." So, Butz was on the lake that night.

Testimony 1: Person: Butz. "I was looking for something and I, er, found it." So, Butz found something, but what?

Testimony 2: Person: Butz. "So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock." So, after finding something, he returned the boat.

Testimony 3: Person: Butz. "Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this 'bang'!" So, he heard a bang after getting back the boat.

Testimony 4: Person: Butz. "I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat." So, after the bang, he didn't see a boat.

Testimony 5: Person: Butz. "So after I heard that single gunshot I went home." So, he left after hearing one gunshot.

Wait, but in Testimony 3, he says he heard a "bang," which could be a gunshot. But in Testimony 5, he says he heard a single gunshot and went home. So, in Testimony 3, he says he heard "this 'bang'!", which could be the gunshot, but in Testimony 5, he says he heard a single gunshot.

But in the evidence, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says Robert was killed by a bullet to the heart, so it's a single shot. So, the murderer used one bullet to kill Robert.

But in Testimony 5, Butz says he heard one gunshot and went home. So, the time of the gunshot is around midnight on 12/25, which matches the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM.

But in Testimony 3, he says he heard the bang as he was thinking about going home, so he heard it around midnight.

Now, looking at the testimonies:

Testimony 5: After hearing the gunshot, he went home. So, he left after the gunshot.

But in Testimony 3, he says he was thinking about going home, then heard the bang, so he stayed a bit longer.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Testimony 3 says he heard the bang, then in Testimony 5, he went home after the gunshot.

But if he heard the gunshot, he would have gone home after that. So, Testimony 5 aligns with that.

Wait, but in Testimony 3, he says he heard the bang, then in Testimony 5, he went home. So, he heard the bang, then went home. That makes sense.

But the key point is that he heard one gunshot, which matches the autopsy report of a single bullet. So, the evidence and testimonies are consistent here.

Wait, but in Testimony 3, he says he heard "this 'bang'!", which is the same as the single gunshot in the autopsy. So, they don't contradict each other.

Wait, but in Testimony 5, he says he heard one gunshot and went home. So, that's consistent with the evidence.

Wait, but looking at the testimonies again:

Testimony 0: He was on the boat that night.

Testimony 1: He found something.

Testimony 2: He returned the boat.

Testimony 3: He heard a bang after getting back.

Testimony 4: After the bang, he looked out but didn't see a boat.

Testimony 5: After the gunshot, he went home.

So, all these testimonies are from Butz's perspective on that night. They all seem to fit together without contradicting the evidence.

Wait, but in the evidence, Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshots. So, that's conflicting with Butz's testimony of one gunshot.

So, if Butz heard one gunshot, but Lotta heard two, that's a contradiction.

Wait, let me check:

Evidence 11: Lotta's Deposition. She heard two gunshots after midnight on 12/25.

But in Testimony 5: Butz heard one gunshot.

So, that's a contradiction because Lotta heard two, and Butz heard one. They can't both be true.

Wait, but in the evidence, the autopsy report says cause of death was one bullet to the heart. So, only one shot was fired.

So, that would mean that Lotta's testimony of two gunshots is wrong, while Butz's testimony of one is correct.

Alternatively, maybe Lotta is lying or misremembering.

So, the evidence says one bullet, one shot, so Butz's testimony aligns with that, while Lotta's testimony contradicts it.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) and Testimony 5 (Butz's testimony).

Wait, but in the testimonies, Testimony 5 is Butz saying he heard one gunshot, which matches the evidence of one shot. So, Lotta's testimony is wrong, so the contradiction is between Lotta's testimony and the evidence.

But the question is asking for evidence and testimony that contradict each other, so it's between Evidence 11 and Testimony 5.

Alternatively, maybe between Evidence 11 and Testimony 3.

Wait, Testimony 3: Butz heard one bang (gunshot), and Lotta heard two. So, that's a contradiction.

So, the evidence says one bullet, so only one gunshot. Therefore, Testimony 5 (heard one gunshot) is correct, and Lotta's testimony is wrong.

So, the contradiction is between Evidence 11 and Testimony 5.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 and Evidence 11.

But in Testimony 3, he says he heard one bang, which is consistent with one gunshot. So, Testimony 3 is correct, and Evidence 11 is wrong.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts is Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) and Testimony 5 (Butz's testimony).

Wait, but Testimony 5 is Butz's fifth testimony, which says he heard one gunshot.

So, the contradiction is between Evidence 11 (two gunshots) and Testimony 5 (one gunshot).

Alternatively, in the testimonies, Testimony 5 is from Butz, so the contradiction is between the evidence (one gunshot) and Lotta's testimony (two gunshots), which would mean that Testimony 5 (one gunshot) is correct, and Evidence 11 is wrong.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts is Evidence 11 and Testimony 5.

Wait, but the question asks for only one pair, so I think the answer is Evidence 11 and Testimony 5.

Alternatively, maybe it's Testimony 5 and Evidence 11.

But let me make sure.

The evidence says one bullet, one shot. Lotta's Deposition says two shots. Butz says one shot.

So, the contradiction is between Lotta's testimony and the evidence, which is supported by Butz's testimony.

So, the pair is Evidence 11 and Testimony 5.

Alternatively, the pair could be Evidence 11 and Testimony 3, but Testimony 3 aligns with the evidence.

Wait, no, Testimony 3 is Butz hearing one bang, which is consistent with one shot. So, Testimony 3 doesn't contradict the evidence.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 11 (two shots) and Testimony 5 (one shot).

So, the answer is Evidence 11 and Testimony 5.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts which testimony. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. There's a murder that happened around Christmas, and there are various pieces of evidence and testimonies that I need to compare.

Looking at the testimonies, they're from a person named Butz. Testimony 5 says, "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" So, Butz is listening to a radio show, and during a specific moment when the DJ says "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", Butz hears a gunshot.

Now, I need to find evidence or a character that contradicts this. Let me check the evidence list.

Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera, which is set to take a picture when a loud noise is detected and faces the lake. So, if there was a gunshot, this camera would have taken a photo at that time.

But wait, the testimonies mention that Butz was on a boat and heard the gunshot around midnight on 12/25. Let me check the evidence related to the time of the incident.

Evidence 4 is Lake Photo, taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. That's after midnight, but the testimonies say the gunshot was just when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", which is around midnight as well. So, the camera would have taken a photo around that time, but the Lake Photo is at 12:15, which is after the gunshot.

But the problem is that the camera is set to take a photo when a loud noise is detected. If Butz heard the gunshot at the time the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", and the camera was facing the lake, would it have captured the gunshot?

Wait, the camera is facing the lake, but the gunshot might have been on the lake or near it. If the camera was set to take a picture when it detected a loud noise, it should have captured the gunshot. But the Lake Photo is taken at 12:15, which is after the time of the gunshot (assuming the DJ said it around midnight).

So, if the testimonies say the gunshot happened just when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", which is around midnight, but the Lake Photo is at 12:15, that means the camera would have taken a photo after the gunshot, not at the time of the gunshot.

Therefore, the camera might not have captured the actual gunshot, but only the noise after the fact. So, the testimony that Butz heard the gunshot at that specific time might not be corroborated by the Lake Photo, which was taken later.

Alternatively, maybe the camera didn't capture the gunshot because it was facing the lake, and the gunshot was onshore or elsewhere. But the description says it's set to take a picture when a loud noise is detected, so it should have captured it.

Wait, but the Lake Photo is taken automatically at 12:15, which is after midnight. So, if the gunshot was at midnight, the camera would have taken a photo at that time, but according to the evidence, it's taken at 12:15. So, maybe the camera didn't capture the gunshot because it was set to take a photo after the noise, but the noise happened before the photo was taken.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

If the camera is set to take a photo when it detects a loud noise, and the loud noise (gunshot) happened at midnight, the camera would take the photo at midnight, not at 12:15. So, the Lake Photo at 12:15 would be after the gunshot. Therefore, the camera didn't capture the gunshot, which contradicts the testimony that Butz heard the gunshot just when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" implying the camera should have captured it.

So, the evidence (Lotta's Camera) doesn't support the testimony (Testimony 5). Therefore, Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) contradicts Testimony 5.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the camera's function. If it's set to take a photo when a loud noise is detected, it would take the photo at the time of the noise, not after. So, if the noise happened at midnight, the photo would be taken at midnight, not at 12:15. Therefore, the Lake Photo at 12:15 doesn't show the gunshot, which contradicts the testimony that Butz heard it at that time.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 5.

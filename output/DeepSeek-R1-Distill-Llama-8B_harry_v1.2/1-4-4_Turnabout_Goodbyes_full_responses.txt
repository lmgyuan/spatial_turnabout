Alright, so I need to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let's see, the story involves a murder at Gourd Lake, and there are several characters and pieces of evidence to consider.

First, I'll look at the testimonies. There's one from Larry Butz, who says he was out in a boat on the lake that night, heard a "bang," looked but didn't see the boat, and then went home after hearing a gunshot. But wait, the victim was Robert Hammond, who was on the boat, and he was shot. If Larry was on the lake, he should have seen the boat or at least the victim's boat returning. But according to his testimony, he didn't notice the boat, which is odd because the boat was there all along.

Now, looking at the evidence, there's an "Overhead Map" that shows the area. If Larry was on the lake, the map should have shown the boat, but maybe he didn't look closely enough or the map wasn't detailed enough. Alternatively, maybe the boat wasn't there when he looked, but that doesn't make sense because Robert was killed around that time.

Also, there's a "Lake Photo" taken automatically at 12:15 AM, but it shows an empty lake. This suggests that Larry's claim of being on the lake might be inconsistent because if he was there, the photo should have shown something, but it's empty. Maybe he wasn't really there, or the photo's timing is off.

Considering all this, it seems like Larry's testimony contradicts the evidence from the Lake Photo and the Overhead Map. He claims to have been on the lake but didn't see the boat, while the photo shows the lake was empty, and the map likely would have shown the boat if he was there. So, Larry's testimony is inconsistent with the evidence.

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 0}

The Overhead Map (Evidence 8) shows the area around Gourd Lake, and if Larry Butz was on the lake, the boat would have been visible. However, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM shows an empty lake, suggesting Larry wasn't there or didn't see the boat, contradicting his testimony.
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, I see that the testimonies are from Larry Butz, who claims to have been on a boat on the lake around the time of the murder. He heard a gunshot and thought he saw something on the water. But looking at the evidence, specifically the Lake Photo taken at 12:15 AM, it shows an empty lake. That means Larry wasn't there or didn't see anything, which contradicts his testimony. Also, the Overhead Map would show if there was a boat, but since the Lake Photo is empty, it supports that Larry wasn't on the lake as he said.

So, the evidence that contradicts his testimony is the Lake Photo (Evidence 4), and his testimony is Testimony 0. Therefore, the pair is Evidence 4 and Testimony 0.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0}

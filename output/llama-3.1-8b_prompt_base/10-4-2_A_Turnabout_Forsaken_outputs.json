    "cot": "The pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other are:\n\nThe testimony from Gravelle states that Ms. Crane was stabbed in the heart with the three-pronged candelabra (Testimony 2) and asks if there is any person who could survive such an injury (Testimony 3). However, evidence 11, Autopsy Report, states that the cause of death was stab wounds to the chest, but also mentions that the head injury sustained post-mortem was the result of a heavy blow to the head with a circular object, which suggests that the victim may not have died immediately from the stab wounds. This contradicts Gravelle's testimony that Ms. Crane was stabbed in the heart with the candelabra.\n"

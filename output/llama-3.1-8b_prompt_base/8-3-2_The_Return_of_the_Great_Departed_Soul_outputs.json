    "cot": "The pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other are:\n\nThe testimony from Gina states that the coppers at the Yard reckoned it was probably some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage (Testimony 3) and that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene (Testimony 2). However, evidence 4, Piece of Green Cloth, shows that a torn piece of canvas-like material backed with rubber was found under the experimentation stage at the exhibition grounds, with scorch marks at the edges, suggesting that the burnt-up bit o' cloth may not have been debris from the explosion on the stage. This contradicts Gina's testimony that the coppers at the Yard reckoned it was probably some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage.\n"

Based on the provided information, I would choose evidence 13 and testimony 20 as the pair that contradict each other. 

Evidence 13 states that the suspect was seen at the scene of the crime, while testimony 20 states that the suspect was not present at the scene of the crime. 

{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 20}

Based on the provided information, I would choose evidence 5 and testimony 9 as the pair that contradict each other. 

Evidence 5 states that the suspect's alibi checks out, while testimony 9 states that the suspect was involved in the crime. 

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 9}
Based on the provided information, I would choose evidence 3 and testimony 1 as the pair that contradict each other. 

Evidence 3 states that the victim was seen entering a building, while testimony 1 states that the victim was not in the building at the time of the crime. 

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 1}

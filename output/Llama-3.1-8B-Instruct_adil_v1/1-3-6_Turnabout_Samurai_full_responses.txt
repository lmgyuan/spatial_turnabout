Evidence 10 states that the suspect was seen at the scene of the crime, while testimony 9 states that the suspect was not present at the scene of the crime. 

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 9}
Based on the provided information, I would choose character 2 and testimony 14 as the pair that contradict each other.

Based on the provided information, I would choose evidence 21 and testimony 35 as the pair that contradict each other. 

Evidence 21 states that the suspect's fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime, while testimony 35 states that the suspect was not present at the scene of the crime. 

{"evidence": 21, "testimony": 35}

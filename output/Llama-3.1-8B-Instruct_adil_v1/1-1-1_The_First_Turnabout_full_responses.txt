The testimony about the time being 1:00 PM (Testimony 4) contradicts the evidence of the time of death from the autopsy report (Evidence 1), which states that the time of death was between 4PM-5PM. This means that if the time of death was indeed between 4PM-5PM, then it is not possible for Frank Sahwit to have seen Larry fleeing the scene at 1:00 PM.

The testimony about seeing a table clock in the apartment (Testimony 1) contradicts the fact that the electricity was out in the building from noon to 6 PM (Evidence 4), which means that the table clock would not have been working during that time.

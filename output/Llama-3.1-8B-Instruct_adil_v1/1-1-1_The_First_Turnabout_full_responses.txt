To accurately answer this question, I would need more information about the characters, evidences, testimonies, and the story. However, assuming I have the necessary information, I will make an educated guess.

For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume the following:

Characters:
1. John
2. Sarah
3. Michael
4. Emily

Evidences:
1. A torn piece of fabric
2. A suspicious letter
3. A security camera footage

Testimonies:
1. John's alibi for the time of the incident
2. Sarah's eyewitness account
3. Michael's testimony about the letter
4. Emily's statement about the security camera footage
5. Sarah's testimony about the torn fabric
6. Michael's alibi for the time of the incident
7. Emily's testimony about John's whereabouts
8. John's testimony about the security camera footage
9. Michael's statement about Sarah's whereabouts
10. Emily's alibi for the time of the incident
11. Sarah's statement about Michael's involvement
12. John's statement about Emily's involvement

Based on the given information, I would choose the following pair:

The suspicious letter (evidence 2) contradicts Sarah's statement about Michael's involvement (testimony 11). 

The suspicious letter (evidence 2) implies that Michael is involved, while Sarah's testimony suggests that Michael is not involved.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 11}
{"character": 2, "testimony": 5}
no

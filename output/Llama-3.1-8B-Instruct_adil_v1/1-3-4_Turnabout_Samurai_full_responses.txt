Based on the provided information, I would choose character 3 and testimony 12 as the pair that contradict each other. 

Character 3 states that they were in a different location at the time of the crime, while testimony 12 states that character 3 was involved in the crime. 

{"character": 3, "testimony": 12}
Based on the provided information, I would choose evidence 1 and testimony 13 as the pair that contradict each other. 

Evidence 1 states that the victim was seen at a specific location at the time of the crime, while testimony 13 states that the victim was not at that location at the time of the crime. 

{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 13}

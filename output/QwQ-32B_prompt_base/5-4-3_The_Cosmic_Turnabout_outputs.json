    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let me start by going through each evidence and testimony to see where there might be inconsistencies.\n\nFirst, looking at the characters and the scenario. The case involves the death of Clay Terran, a HAT-2 crew member, and the defendant is Solomon Starbuck. The key here is to find where a piece of evidence directly contradicts a testimony given by someone.\n\nLet me list out the testimonies first:\n\nTestimonies from Yuri Cosmos (Character 10):\n- Testimony 0: He and Detective Arme went to the boarding lounge via the Control Room and saw a figure (presumably Starbuck) and Terran on the floor. Arme fired two warning shots.\n- Testimony 1: They entered via the Control Room door.\n- Testimony 2: They saw a figure standing and Terran on the floor.\n- Testimony 3: The figure was Starbuck.\n- Testimony 4: Arme fired two shots.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences:\n\nEvidence 15: Bullet from Arme's Gun is a .38 caliber bullet found near the victim's oxygen tank. It matches the caliber mentioned in Evidence 10 (bullet hole from .38). \n\nEvidence 12: A .10 caliber bullet found in a gutter. \n\nTestimony 4 says Arme fired two warning shots. If she fired two bullets, there should be two bullets found. However, Evidence 15 mentions only one bullet from a .38 (Arme's gun caliber), and Evidence 12 is a different caliber. That might indicate a discrepancy, but maybe the two shots could be the .38 and the .10? Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at Evidence 10: The bullet hole in the boarding lounge is from a .38, which matches Arme's gun. So if Arme fired two shots, but only one bullet is found (Evidence 15), that could be a problem. But maybe one bullet is embedded somewhere else, but the testimony says two shots. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 7: Security Camera Video shows the defendant and victim escaping to the boarding lounge, and the video ends there. If Cosmos and Arme entered via the Control Room door (Testimony 1), but Evidence 11 says the Control Room door lock can only be operated by the director (Cosmos). Since Cosmos is the director, that's okay. But does that affect anything?\n\nWait, Testimony 1 says they went via the Control Room and peeked in. The door lock (Evidence 11) requires the director's access. Since Cosmos is the director, that's possible. So that part seems okay.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 2 says they saw a figure standing and Terran on the floor. The autopsy (Evidence 1) says Terran was discovered in the third-floor boarding lounge. So that aligns. \n\nWait, the contradiction might be in the bullets. Testimony 4 says two warning shots were fired. If each shot is a bullet, there should be two bullets. Evidence 15 is one .38 (from Arme's gun), and Evidence 12 is a .10. That's two bullets, but different calibers. If Arme's gun is .38, then the two shots should be .38 each. But there's only one .38 found (Evidence 15), and another .10 (maybe from someone else). So that could be a contradiction: testimony says two shots from Arme (both .38), but evidence shows only one .38 and another .10. Hence, missing a bullet or inconsistency in caliber.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two shots are the .38 (Evidence 15) and the .10 (Evidence 12), but that would mean someone else fired the .10. Then the testimony's claim that Arme fired two would be wrong if only one .38 was found. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the .10 bullet (Evidence 12) is from the warning shots, but that contradicts the testimony that Arme's gun is .38. \n\nThis seems like a possible contradiction between Testimony 4 (two shots from Arme's .38) and Evidence 12 (a .10 bullet found) plus Evidence 15 (one .38). Since two shots would need two bullets of .38, but only one is found. So the testimony's claim of two shots might contradict the evidence of only one .38 bullet found. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two shots are the one .38 (Evidence 15) and another that's unaccounted for, but the existence of the .10 could be from another source. \n\nAlternatively, looking at another angle: Testimony 3 says the figure was Starbuck. Evidence 3 is the utility knife with Terran's blood but no prints. If Starbuck used that, but no prints, maybe he's not the killer. But that's more about guilt than contradiction.\n\nWait, another point: Evidence 16 is a lighter with Athena's prints in blood. That might not relate directly here.\n\nWait, let me check another evidence. Evidence 7's security camera video ends when they entered the boarding lounge. If Cosmos and Arme entered later, maybe the video doesn't capture them. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 1 says they went via the Control Room. Evidence 11's door lock to the Control Room requires the director's access. Since Cosmos is the director, that's okay. So no contradiction there.\n\nHmm. The main possible contradiction is the number and caliber of bullets. Testimony 4 says two warning shots (from Arme's .38), but Evidence 15 shows one .38 bullet and Evidence 12 a .10. So if two shots were fired, there should be two .38 bullets, but only one is found. That would mean either the testimony is wrong about the number, or the bullets aren't accounted for. \n\nAlternatively, the two shots could be the one .38 and the .10, but that would mean another person fired the .10, contradicting the testimony that only Arme fired. \n\nThus, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (two shots from Arme's gun, .38) and Evidence 12 (a .10 bullet found) plus Evidence 15 (only one .38). \n\nSo, the pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 4, or Evidence 15 and Testimony 4. Wait, the question asks for one pair. The user might expect one of these. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 10: the bullet hole is from a .38. If two shots were fired, one might be in the wall (the hole) and the other bullet could be the one in Evidence 15 near the tank. But then that's two .38 bullets. But Evidence 12 is a different caliber, so that's an extra bullet. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the testimony says two shots, but only one .38 bullet is found (Evidence 15) and another bullet of different caliber (Evidence 12). Therefore, the testimony's claim of two shots from Arme's gun would be contradicted by the evidence of only one .38 bullet and an unrelated .10. \n\nThus, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 12 or 15. The user wants one pair. Since the question says \"which evidence and testimony contradict each other\", the best fit would be between Testimony 4 and Evidence 12, because the .10 bullet isn't from Arme's gun. \n\nAlternatively, the main point is that two shots should mean two .38 bullets, but only one is found. Hence, Testimony 4 (two shots) vs Evidence 15 (only one .38 bullet found). But the problem is that the bullet hole (Evidence 10) is another .38. So the total would be two .38 (Evidence 10 and 15) plus the .10. That would mean two from Arme and one from else. But the testimony says two shots by Arme. Then maybe the bullet hole (Evidence 10) is one, and the bullet in Evidence 15 is the second. So two .38 bullets account for the two shots. But then the .10 (Evidence 12) is from someone else. In that case, there's no contradiction. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check other evidences. \n\nWait, Evidence 15 is the bullet from Arme's gun, which is a .38. The bullet hole (Evidence 10) is also .38. So that's two .38 bullets: one embedded in the wall (the hole) and one on the ground (Evidence 15). That would account for two shots. Then the .10 (Evidence 12) is from someone else. Then Testimony 4's claim of two shots from Arme would align with the two .38 bullets. So no contradiction there. \n\nTherefore, maybe another contradiction exists elsewhere. \n\nLooking again at Testimony 1: They went via the Control Room and peeked in. Evidence 11 says the Control Room door can only be opened by the director (Cosmos), which he is, so that's okay. \n\nTestimony 2 says they saw a figure standing in the lounge. Evidence 7's security camera video ends when they entered the boarding lounge. So the video doesn't show the scene Cosmos describes. If the video stops before Cosmos and Arme arrive, then the testimony's account isn't captured on camera, but that's not a contradiction unless the video should show it. The testimony's account isn't contradicted by the video's end. \n\nAnother angle: The autopsy (Evidence 1) says cause of death was stabbing. The utility knife (Evidence 3) has Terran's blood but no prints. If Starbuck used that, but no prints, maybe he wore gloves. But that's about guilt, not contradiction. \n\nWait, Testimony 3 says the figure was Starbuck. Evidence 16's lighter has Athena's prints, but that's unrelated. \n\nHmm, maybe looking at Testimony 4: Arme fired two warning shots. Evidence 15 is one bullet from her gun. Evidence 10 is the bullet hole (another .38). So that's two .38 bullets, accounting for two shots. Thus, no contradiction. \n\nThen perhaps another contradiction: \n\nTestimony 2 says they saw the figure standing and Terran on the floor. The autopsy says Terran was discovered in the boarding lounge, so that's consistent. \n\nWait, maybe Evidence 7's security camera video shows the defendant (Starbuck) and victim entering the boarding lounge, but if Cosmos and Arme arrived later and saw Starbuck there, then the video ending when they entered the lounge would not show Starbuck leaving. If the video ends when they entered the lounge, then the video might not show Starbuck leaving, but that's not a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, if the testimony claims that when they arrived, Starbuck was standing there, but the video shows him entering, maybe timing is an issue. But without exact times, hard to say. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's try another approach.\n\nLooking for an evidence that directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nTestimony 4 says Arme fired two warning shots. If the evidence shows only one bullet from her gun, that would be a problem. But as per Evidence 15 and Evidence 10, there are two .38 bullets (one in the wall, one on the ground), so that matches two shots. The .10 is another bullet, but that's from someone else. So Testimony 4 is okay. \n\nAnother point: Testimony 0 says they rushed towards the boarding lounge via Control Room. Evidence 11 says the Control Room door requires director access. Since Cosmos is the director, that's okay. \n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (figure was Starbuck) and Evidence 6 (Launch Pad 1 Door Lock has Starbuck's prints). If Starbuck was in the area, that's consistent, but not a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 16's lighter with Athena's prints might be a red herring. \n\nWait, looking at Testimony 4 again: Arme fired two warning shots. Evidence 15 is one bullet from her gun, and Evidence 10's bullet hole is another. That's two .38 bullets, so two shots. Thus, no contradiction there. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check other testimonies and evidences again.\n\nEvidence 7's security camera video ends when they (defendant and victim) entered the boarding lounge. So the video doesn't show what happened after they entered, like the stabbing or the arrival of Cosmos and Arme. Therefore, the testimony's account (seeing the figure and Terran on the floor) isn't captured on video, but that's not a contradiction, just missing info.\n\nAnother possible contradiction: Testimony 2 says they saw the figure standing and Terran on the floor. The autopsy (Evidence 1) says cause of death was stabbing. If the stabbing happened before they arrived, then that's okay. No contradiction here.\n\nWait, maybe the key is in the bullets' locations. The bullet from Arme's gun (Evidence 15) is near the oxygen tank, which was struck by a bullet (Evidence 8). So that bullet might be the one that damaged the tank, leading to Terran's death? But the cause was stabbing. Hmm, the oxygen tank damage might be separate.\n\nAlternatively, the bullet hole in the boarding lounge (Evidence 10) could be from one of Arme's shots. \n\nI'm stuck. Let me try to think of other pairs.\n\nLooking at Evidence 14: Aura's statement says the perp had a lighter and knife. Evidence 16 is the lighter found with Athena's prints. If Athena is the perp, that contradicts her being the lawyer. But that's more about guilt than contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says the figure was Starbuck. Evidence 3 is the utility knife with Terran's blood but no prints. If Starbuck used it, but no prints, maybe he wore gloves, so no contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 12. Testimony 4 says Arme fired two .38 shots. Evidence 12 shows a .10 bullet, which couldn't be from her. So if two shots were fired, but one was .10, that's a contradiction. But the two shots are supposed to be from Arme's gun, which is .38. Thus, the existence of a .10 bullet not from her would mean someone else fired, but the testimony only mentions Arme's shots. Hence, the testimony's claim that only Arme fired two shots (both .38) is contradicted by the presence of a .10 bullet (Evidence 12), implying another shooter. \n\nThat would mean Testimony 4 and Evidence 12 contradict each other. \n\nSo the answer would be {\"evidence\":12, \"testimony\":4}.\n</think>\n"

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and they want to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. I need to go through each piece of evidence and testimony to see where there's a discrepancy.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the testimonies given by Yuri Cosmos. The relevant testimonies here are:\n\n- Testimony 0: Cosmos and Detective Arme went to the Control Room together.\n- Testimony 1: They saw a figure and Terran in the boarding lounge from the Control Room.\n- Testimony 2: They were in the Control Room when the figure fired at them.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences, specifically Evidence 11: The Control Room Door Lock description says it can only be operated by the director and has backup power. Also, the Space Center Diagram (Evidence 2) might show the layout. \n\nWait, Evidence 11's description mentions that the Control Room door lock is to the east and can only be opened by the director. If Cosmos, as the director, could access it, that's fine. But Testimony 2 says they were in the Control Room when the figure fired at them. However, the key point here might be the bullet found in Evidence 12, which is a .10 caliber bullet from the gutter. Evidence 15 is a .38 caliber bullet from Arme's gun. \n\nWait, Testimony 2 says the figure fired at them while they were in the Control Room. If the figure was in the boarding lounge and they were in the Control Room, which is east, maybe separated by a door? The Control Room door lock (Evidence 11) requires the director, so maybe Cosmos could get in, but if the figure was in the lounge, could they shoot through the door? The bullet found in Evidence 12 is .10 caliber, but Arme's bullet (Evidence 15) is .38. If the figure fired at them, the bullet should match either .10 or .38. But if the testimony claims the figure fired, but the only bullet found is from Arme's gun (.38), then there's a contradiction. However, the testimony says the figure fired at them, but the evidence shows the bullet from Arme's gun is the one near the tank. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Control Room's door lock (Evidence 11) being operable only by the director means that unless Cosmos let Arme in, others can't enter. If they were both in the Control Room, that's possible, but maybe the path to get there is blocked unless the director allowed it. But the main contradiction might be between the bullet testimony and the evidence. \n\nWait, Testimony 2 says the figure fired at them while they were in the Control Room. If the figure was in the boarding lounge, and they were in the Control Room (east side), perhaps separated by a door or wall. The bullet hole in the lounge (Evidence 10) is .38, which matches Arme's bullet (Evidence 15). So if the figure fired, but the bullet found is from Arme's gun, that contradicts the testimony that the figure shot at them. Alternatively, maybe the figure's bullet is the .10 caliber (Evidence 12), but that's in a gutter. So if the testimony says the figure fired at them, but the bullet from that would be .10, but the only bullet found near the scene (the tank) is .38 from Arme. Therefore, the testimony that the figure fired at them contradicts the evidence of the bullet found (Evidence 12 and 15). But I need to check the exact descriptions.\n\nLooking at Evidence 12: It's a .10 caliber bullet found in the gutter. Evidence 15 is a .38 from Arme's gun near the oxygen tank. The testimony says the figure fired at them (Cosmos and Arme in Control Room), so if the figure used a .10, then the bullet in the gutter (Evidence 12) might be that, but where was that found? The gutter is in the boarding lounge. If they were in the Control Room, the bullet would have to go through the door, maybe ending up in the lounge's gutter. But the testimony says the figure was in the lounge, so if they fired towards the Control Room, the bullet could end up in the lounge's gutter. However, the key point is that the bullet from Arme's gun (Evidence 15) is .38, which matches the bullet hole in the lounge (Evidence 10, .38). So the testimony claims the figure fired at them, but the bullet found near the tank is from Arme's gun, which would be from when Arme fired warning shots (as per another testimony). Therefore, the figure's bullet (if any) would be the .10, but maybe that's unrelated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 11. If the Control Room door can only be opened by the director (Cosmos), then for Arme to be in the Control Room with him, Cosmos must have let him in. But if that's the case, the testimony aligns. Hmm, maybe not. \n\nWait, another angle: Testimony 0 says they rushed to the Control Room together. If the door requires the director's access (Evidence 11), then only Cosmos could open it, so Arme couldn't get in without him. So their presence there is possible. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 7 (Security Camera Video): it shows the defendant and victim escaping to the boarding lounge, and the video ends there. If Cosmos and Arme were in the Control Room, perhaps the camera didn't capture their entry, but that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe Testimony 2 says they were in the Control Room when the figure fired at them. If the Control Room is separated by a door that the figure couldn't open (since only director has access), then the figure couldn't have entered to shoot them. So if the figure was in the boarding lounge and shot through the door, but the door's lock (Evidence 11) is on the east (Control Room side), maybe the door is between the lounge and Control Room. So if the figure was in the lounge, they could shoot through the door towards the Control Room. But the bullet hole in the lounge (Evidence 10) is .38, which matches Arme's bullet. If the figure fired a .10, that would be Evidence 12, but that's in the gutter. So the testimony's claim that the figure fired at them might be contradicted by the evidence that the only bullet from the area related to the shooting is Arme's .38, suggesting that Arme fired the shot, not the figure. Thus, Testimony 2 (figure fired at them) contradicts Evidence 15 (bullet from Arme's gun found there), but the user wants one pair. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 2 and Evidence 12. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the key is Testimony 2 says the figure fired at them while they were in the Control Room, implying the bullet came from the figure. But Evidence 12 is a .10 bullet (from the figure's weapon?), but it's in the gutter. Evidence 15 is .38 from Arme's gun, which would be from when Arme fired warning shots (as per Cosmos' testimony Testimony 4). So the testimony that the figure fired at them would mean the bullet should be .10, but the bullet found near the tank is Arme's .38. Thus, the testimony's claim that the figure shot at them is contradicted by the evidence that the bullet there is from Arme. So Testimony 2 and Evidence 15 would contradict. But the user wants one pair. Let me check the exact numbers.\n\nThe user's last question's answer was {\"evidence\":12, \"testimony\":4}, which might have been about the bullet caliber. Here, maybe the same logic applies. Testimony 4 in the previous case mentioned two warning shots, and Evidence 12 was a .10 bullet, so that's why they contradicted. In this current problem, Testimony 2 says the figure fired at them (so the figure's bullet), but the bullet found in the gutter (Evidence12) is .10, which might be the figure's, but the bullet near the tank is from Arme (Evidence15). However, the testimony doesn't specify where the bullet went, just that they were shot at. So maybe the contradiction is that the testimony says the figure fired, but the only bullet found from the figure (if any) is in the gutter, while the main bullet near the victim is from Arme, so that's a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the key is that the Control Room door's lock (Evidence11) requires the director, so if they were in the Control Room, that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 7: the security camera video ends when they entered the boarding lounge. So if Cosmos and Arme arrived later, the video wouldn't show them, but that's not a contradiction. \n\nWait, another angle: Testimony 0 says they rushed to the Control Room together. The Control Room door lock (Evidence11) can only be opened by the director. So if Arme was with Cosmos, he could enter, so that's okay. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for the most direct contradiction. Testimony 2 says they were in the Control Room when the figure fired at them. The bullet hole in the lounge (Evidence10) is .38, which matches Arme's bullet (Evidence15). If the figure fired, it would need to be a different caliber. Since the testimony says the figure fired, but the bullet there is from Arme, that's a contradiction. Thus, Testimony 2 and Evidence15 contradict. But the user's previous example used bullet caliber differences. \n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2's claim that the figure fired at them when they were in the Control Room might contradict Evidence11's door lock. If the door can only be opened by the director, then the figure couldn't have gotten into the Control Room to shoot them from inside. But if they were in the boarding lounge and shot through the door, then the door's lock doesn't prevent bullets. So that's not a contradiction. \n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence7. The security camera video (Evidence7) ends when they entered the boarding lounge. If Cosmos and Arme arrived later, the video wouldn't capture their entry, but that's not a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Testimony 1 says they saw the figure in the middle of the lounge, but the autopsy report (Evidence1) says the victim was found there. That's consistent. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all evidences and testimonies again:\n\nTestimonies by Cosmos:\n0. Went to Control Room together.\n1. Saw figure and Terran in lounge from Control Room.\n2. While in Control Room, figure fired at them.\n\nEvidences relevant:\n11: Control Room door requires director (Cosmos) to open. So Arme can't enter without him, which aligns with them going together.\n\nEvidence12: .10 bullet in gutter (figure's gun?), Evidence15: .38 bullet from Arme's gun near tank.\n\nTestimony2 says figure fired at them, implying that bullet came from the figure. But the bullet near the tank is from Arme (Evidence15), which would be from his warning shots (Testimony4). So the figure's bullet (if fired) would be the .10 in the gutter (Evidence12). So the testimony's claim that the figure fired at them is supported by Evidence12's bullet, but the main bullet at the crime scene (near the tank) is from Arme. That might not be a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between the testimony that the figure was there and the autopsy report (Evidence1) which says cause of death was stabbing, but that's not conflicting.\n\nWait, the autopsy says cause of death was stabbing (Evidence1), so the bullet to the oxygen tank (Evidence8) might not be the killing blow. The stabbing could be from the utility knife (Evidence3). So the figure's actions (shooting) don't directly cause death, so that's okay.\n\nHmm, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony2 and Evidence11. If they were in the Control Room, which requires the director's access, that's okay since Cosmos is the director. So no contradiction there.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the Control Room door lock (Evidence11) has backup power, so even if the power was out (from the bombing), they could still get in. That's consistent with them being there.\n\nI'm a bit stuck. Maybe I need to look for the most straightforward contradiction. Let's see:\n\nTestimony2 says the figure fired at them while they were in the Control Room. The bullet from that would have to be the .10 (Evidence12), but that bullet is in the boarding lounge's gutter. If they were in the Control Room, the bullet would have to pass through the door into the lounge, ending up in the gutter. That's possible. However, the bullet from Arme's gun (Evidence15) is near the oxygen tank, which would be from when he fired warning shots (as per Testimony4). So the figure's bullet is the .10, which is found, so that's consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Testimony0 says they went to the Control Room together, but Evidence11's door lock requires the director, so that's okay. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing an evidence. Let me check Evidence9: the Space Center pamphlet includes a diagram of the boarding lounge. Maybe the layout shows that the Control Room and lounge are in a way that makes the testimony impossible. But without the diagram details, hard to say.\n\nWait, the user's previous answer was about bullet calibers. Here, Testimony2 says the figure fired at them, implying that bullet is from the figure. If the only bullet from the figure is the .10 (Evidence12), but the testimony doesn't mention caliber, so maybe that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony2 and Evidence7. The security camera video ends when the defendant and victim entered the lounge. If the figure (defendant?) was there when Cosmos and Arme arrived later, the video wouldn't show them, but that's not a contradiction. \n\nHmm. Maybe the correct answer is between Testimony2 and Evidence12? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe Testimony2 and Evidence15. If the figure fired, but the bullet there is from Arme, that's a contradiction. So:\n\nTestimony2 says the figure fired at them, but the bullet found at the scene (near the tank) is from Arme's gun (Evidence15), implying that Arme's shot was the one fired at them, not the figure. Therefore, Testimony2 and Evidence15 contradict each other. So the pair would be {\"evidence\":15, \"testimony\":2}.\n\nAlternatively, the bullet in the gutter (Evidence12) is the figure's, and the one near the tank is Arme's, so the testimony's claim that the figure fired at them is supported by the .10 bullet, but the main contradiction might be that the figure's bullet is in the gutter, not near them. But the testimony just says they were shot at, so that's okay.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the testimony says the figure was in the middle of the lounge, and they were in the Control Room. The bullet hole in the lounge (Evidence10) is .38, which matches Arme's caliber. So if the figure fired at them from the lounge towards the Control Room, the bullet would go through the door into the Control Room, but the hole is in the lounge, implying the shot was fired from outside into the lounge. That would contradict the testimony that the figure was in the lounge and fired towards the Control Room. Because the bullet hole direction would be inward if the figure was inside shooting out, but the hole is in the lounge, so maybe it was fired from outside. Thus, Testimony1 (saw figure in the lounge) and Evidence10 (bullet hole in lounge from .38) would suggest that the bullet came from outside (Arme's shot), meaning the figure couldn't have fired in that direction. So Testimony1 and Evidence10 contradict. But the user wants evidence and testimony.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony2 says the figure fired at them (in Control Room from lounge), so the bullet would have to come from the lounge into the Control Room, but the bullet hole in the lounge (Evidence10) is from a .38 (Arme's) which would be fired from the Control Room into the lounge. Thus, the hole's direction would be from Control Room to lounge, meaning Arme fired at the figure, not the other way. Therefore, Testimony2's claim that the figure fired at them contradicts the bullet hole's direction (Evidence10), because the hole shows the shot came from Control Room to lounge (Arme's shot), not the other way. \n\nAh! That makes sense. If the bullet hole in the lounge (Evidence10) was made by a .38 caliber bullet (from Arme's gun), that means the bullet was fired from the Control Room (where Arme and Cosmos were) into the lounge. So the hole is in the lounge wall, meaning the shot came from the Control Room side. Therefore, the testimony that the figure (in the lounge) fired at them (in Control Room) would require the bullet to go from lounge to Control Room, but the hole is in the lounge, indicating the shot was from Control Room to lounge. Thus, the testimony's claim that the figure fired at them is contradicted by the bullet hole's direction (Evidence10). \n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Testimony2 and Evidence10. The testimony says the figure (in lounge) shot at them (in Control Room), but the bullet hole in the lounge wall (Evidence10) shows the bullet came from the Control Room side (towards the lounge), meaning Arme fired at the figure, not vice versa. \n\nSo the correct pair is {\"evidence\":10, \"testimony\":2}.\n</think>\n"

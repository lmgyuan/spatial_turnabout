    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let me start by going through each piece of evidence and testimony one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies from Dick Gumshoe. Testimony 0 to 5 are all his. Testimony 2 says the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood on the memo next to the body. Testimony 3 mentions lab results showing the blood was the victim's (Mia's). Testimony 4 says there was blood on the victim's finger, implying she wrote the name herself. Testimony 5 states that the victim wrote the killer's name.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence. Evidence 3 is the receipt with letters written in blood on the back. The description says it's a department store receipt for a glass light stand, purchased the day before the murder. The blood writings here might be part of this. Wait, but Testimony 2 says the memo next to the body had \"Maya\" in blood. But Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood letters. Are these the same items?\n\nWait, the memo mentioned in Testimony 1-2-3 is a separate item. Evidence 3 is the receipt, but Testimony 1 says \"a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\" So that memo is different from the receipt. The receipt's blood writings might not be the same as the memo. But maybe the blood on the receipt is from Mia? The testimony says the blood on the memo was Mia's (Testimony 3). But if the receipt's blood is also Mia's, that's okay. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo which says a conversation is recorded on her cell phone. Evidence 6 is the cell phone which has the conversation. Evidence 12 is the Bellboy's Affidavit about the man in the hotel. Evidence 13 is a newspaper clipping with \"White\" written on it. Evidence 14 is Mia's memo with names.\n\nLooking for contradictions. Let's see, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name. If the name was \"Maya\", then the killer would be Maya. But Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo about the recorded conversation. Maybe that contradicts if the conversation proves she's innocent?\n\nAlternatively, the Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon. The autopsy report (Evidence 5) says cause was blunt force trauma. The weapon is a statue, so that's consistent. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a glass light stand. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for buying that stand. Maybe the light stand was used in the attack? But the murder weapon is the Thinker statue. So maybe the glass shards are from something else, like maybe a struggle? Not sure if that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, the Thinker is the murder weapon (Evidence 1's description says it's the murder weapon). But the autopsy report says the cause was a blunt object. So that's okay. The Thinker is a statue, so that fits. The glass shards might be from the light stand that was broken, perhaps during the attack. But then why is the Thinker the murder weapon? That's okay, maybe the glass shards are unrelated, but not a contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 2 says \"Maya\" was written in blood on the memo next to the body. Testimony 3 confirms the blood is Mia's. Testimony 4 says blood on the victim's finger, so she wrote it herself. But if Mia wrote \"Maya\" on the memo, that would implicate her sister. But maybe the contradiction is that Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo) says there's a recorded conversation. If that conversation shows that Maya was elsewhere, then the blood writing might be a setup. But that's more of an inconsistency than a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 13, the newspaper clipping about a politician's suicide with \"White\" written on it. The name \"Redd White\" is a witness. Maybe that's a clue, but not a contradiction.\n\nWait, Evidence 12 is the Bellboy's Affidavit describing the man who stayed with Maya in the hotel. If that man was someone else, maybe the killer, but not sure.\n\nWait, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name. If the name was \"Maya\", then Maya is the killer. But Evidence 4's memo says there's a recorded conversation between Mia and Maya. If that conversation shows Mia was alive after the time of death, that would contradict the timeline. Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says time of death was 9 PM on 9/5. If the conversation was recorded after that, that would be impossible. So if the cell phone (Evidence 6) has a conversation after 9 PM, that would contradict the autopsy report. But the Evidence 4's memo says the conversation is recorded on Maya's phone. Let me check the descriptions again.\n\nEvidence 6's description says \"Holds a conversation between the Chief and Maya. Click here for details.\" The Chief is Mia. If the conversation's timestamp is after 9 PM, then that's a problem. But the problem is, the autopsy says death was at 9 PM. The report also says she may have lived for a few minutes after the blow. So if the conversation was within those minutes, maybe. But if the conversation was recorded later, that's impossible. So if the conversation is after 9:00 PM, that would contradict the autopsy's time of death. But without knowing the exact time of the conversation, maybe that's not certain.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Testimonies from April May (Character 4), her testimony (Evidence 9?) Wait, the Testimonies section lists Testimony 0-5 as from Gumshoe, but the Evidences include May Testimony (Evidence 9 and 10?), wait no, the Testimonies listed are the ones under \"Testimonies\" section. Let me check again.\n\nThe Testimonies provided are the ones under the Testimonies section. The user listed Testimonies 0-5, all by Gumshoe. The Evidences include \"May Testimony\" as Evidence 9 and 10 (though they might be duplicates, but descriptions are the same). So Evidence 9's testimony says \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\" That's from April May's testimony. So that's a separate testimony not in the Testimonies list. Wait, no, the user's input says Testimonies are under the Testimonies section, which are the first 6. The Evidences include \"May Testimony\" as Evidence 9 and 10, which are separate.\n\nHmm, so the May Testimony (Evidence 9) is a testimony from April May. She testifies that she saw Maya commit the murder. So her testimony is that Maya did it, which aligns with the blood writing of \"Maya\". But if there's evidence contradicting that, like the recorded conversation showing Maya wasn't there, that would be a contradiction. But the question is to find a pair between Evidence and Testimony (from the Testimonies section, which are Gumshoe's).\n\nWait, the user says \"Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?\" The testimony can be from any of the Testimonies listed, which are the ones under \"Testimonies\" (Testimony 0-5 by Gumshoe), or are the Evidences' testimonies (like May Testimony as Evidence 9) considered as part of the Testimonies? The question says \"evidences and testimonies\" provided. The Testimonies section includes Gumshoe's statements, and the Evidences include some testimonies like Evidence 9 and 10 (May Testimony). So perhaps the Testimonies in the question include both the Testimonies section and the testimonies listed as evidence items.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"You are provided with a list of characters, evidences and testimonies.\" So the Testimonies listed under the \"Testimonies\" section (Testimony 0-5) are separate from the Evidence items which may include testimonies (like Evidence 9 and 10). So the question is to find a contradiction between any Evidence (including those that are testimonies like Evidence 9) and any Testimony from the Testimonies section (Gumshoe's).\n\nSo let's see: Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name (Maya). Evidence 9 (May Testimony) says she saw Maya commit the murder, which aligns with that. But maybe another contradiction.\n\nWait, looking again at Evidence 3: the receipt with blood letters on the back. Testimony 2 says the memo next to the body had \"Maya\" in blood. If the receipt's blood writings are different, but maybe the receipt's blood is someone else's? Wait, Testimony 3 says the blood on the memo was Mia's. The receipt's blood might be from someone else, but the problem is if the receipt's blood is supposed to be part of the same evidence but contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blood on the victim's finger (Testimony 4) would be Mia's blood, which is consistent. So that's okay.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (memo with \"Maya\" in blood) and Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo about the recorded conversation). If the recorded conversation shows that Maya was not present, then the blood writing would be a setup. But that's more of a contradiction between testimonies and evidence, but not sure if direct.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider Evidence 12: Bellboy's Affidavit describes the man who stayed with Maya in the hotel. If that man is the real killer, then the blood writing implicating Maya is a red herring. But that's not a direct contradiction between an evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at Evidence 13: the newspaper clipping with \"White\" written on it. The witness Redd White is the CEO of Bluecorp. Maybe the \"White\" written there is pointing to him, but the clipping is about a suicide. If Redd White's testimony contradicts something, but not sure.\n\nWait another angle: The Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon. The autopsy says the cause was blunt force trauma from a blunt object. That matches. But the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a glass light stand. If the murder weapon was the Thinker statue, then the glass shards might be from another object, perhaps the light stand was used to create a distraction or part of the crime scene setup. Not a contradiction.\n\nWait, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. If the glass light stand was broken (Evidence 2), then that's consistent. But if the murder weapon was the Thinker, then the glass shards are unrelated but part of the scene. Still okay.\n\nHmm, maybe the key is in the blood writings. Testimony 2 says the memo next to the body had \"Maya\" in blood. Testimony 3 says the blood is Mia's. So Mia wrote \"Maya\" on the memo. That would mean Mia was alive after being hit, as the autopsy report says she may have lived a few minutes. But if the recorded conversation (Evidence 6) has a timestamp after 9 PM, that would be impossible. Wait, the autopsy report says time of death was 9 PM, but she may have lived a few minutes. So if the conversation was recorded at 9:05, that's possible. But the problem is, the memo (Evidence 4) says the conversation is on Maya's phone. The conversation between Mia and Maya\u2014if Mia was writing the memo next to her body, maybe the conversation was before the attack.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (\"the victim wrote the killer's name\") and Evidence 4/Maya's Memo. If the recorded conversation includes the killer's confession, then the name written might be false. But not a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, looking at Testimony 0: Gumshoe says he examined the scene after securing the suspect. If the suspect was Maya, but Evidence 12's affidavit describes someone else staying with Maya, then maybe the real suspect is that man. But that's more of an inconsistency than a contradiction between specific items.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Testimonies and Evidences again carefully.\n\nTestimony 2: \"On it, the word 'Maya' was written clearly in blood!\" (Gumshoe)\n\nEvidence 3: Receipt with letters written in blood on the back. The receipt is for a glass light stand.\n\nWait, maybe the Testimony 2 is referring to the receipt (Evidence 3), not a separate memo. But the Testimony 1 says Gumshoe found a memo next to the body. So that memo is a different item from the receipt. The memo's blood writing says \"Maya\", while the receipt's blood letters could be something else. But Testimony 2 specifically says the memo had \"Maya\" in blood. So the receipt's blood writings are separate. But perhaps the receipt's blood is from someone else, but Testimony 3 says the blood on the memo (the one with \"Maya\") is Mia's. So that's consistent.\n\nHmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Evidence 9 (April May's testimony that she saw Maya commit the murder) and another evidence? But the question requires pairing an Evidence with a Testimony from the Testimonies section (Gumshoe's). \n\nWait, another angle: The Thinker (Evidence 1) has its gears removed. The description says it's a clock made by Larry Butz. If the gears were removed, maybe it couldn't have been used as a clock, but as a weapon. But the autopsy's cause is blunt force trauma, which matches. Not a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) show that the victim couldn't have been struck in the way described by the May Testimony (Evidence 9). For example, if the floor plan shows the layout makes it impossible for the victim to run to the right as per the testimony. But without details on the floor plan, hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the Wiretap (Evidence 7) found in Miss May's room might be evidence of eavesdropping, implying someone was spying. If that's connected to the murder, but not sure.\n\nWait, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name. If the killer's name was \"Maya\", but Evidence 4's memo implies Maya had a recorded conversation with Mia, perhaps showing she was innocent. But without the content of the recording, hard to tell.\n\nHmm, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (memo with \"Maya\" in blood) and Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo about the recorded conversation). If the recorded conversation proves that Maya was not there, then the blood writing would be a setup. But that's an indirect contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 13: the newspaper clipping with \"White\" written on it. The witness Redd White's name includes \"White\", maybe that's a clue. But how does that contradict a testimony?\n\nWait, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name. If the killer was someone else, like Redd White, then the blood writing of \"Maya\" is false. But the newspaper clipping might link to Redd White's involvement. But that's not a direct contradiction between an evidence and testimony.\n\nWait another thought: The receipt (Evidence 3) was purchased the day before the murder. The murder happened on 9/5 at 9 PM. The receipt is from the day before, so 9/4. The glass light stand was bought then. If the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from that stand, then it was broken during the murder. But the murder weapon is the Thinker statue. So the light stand was broken perhaps during the struggle, but not the murder weapon. Not a contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something obvious. Let's think again about the blood writings. The Testimonies say that the memo next to the body had \"Maya\" in Mia's blood (Testimony 2-3-4-5). So Mia wrote that herself. But if there's evidence that shows Mia couldn't have written that, like her hands were injured and couldn't write, but there's no such evidence listed. Alternatively, the blood on the victim's finger (Testimony 4) would mean she could write. So that's consistent.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (\"the victim wrote the killer's name\") and Evidence 9 (May Testimony: \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\"). If the victim was struck while running, maybe she couldn't have written the name after that. But the autopsy says she may have lived a few minutes. So possible.\n\nAlternatively, the key is in the two photographs (Evidence 10 and 11) labeled \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A/B\". Maybe those show something contradicting the testimonies. But without their content, hard to tell.\n\nWait, another angle: The Thinker's gears were removed (Evidence 1). If the gears are missing, maybe it can't be used as a clock, but as a weapon. But that's fine. The murder weapon is a blunt object, so that's okay.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check each Evidence and Testimony pair again systematically.\n\nLooking for any pair where an evidence directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nTestimony 0: Gumshoe examined the scene after securing the suspect. If the suspect was someone else, but that's not an evidence contradiction.\n\nTestimony 1: Gumshoe found a memo next to the body. Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood writings. Are they the same? No, the memo is separate. So Testimony 1 is about the memo, which is a different item from the receipt.\n\nTestimony 2: The memo had \"Maya\" in blood. Evidence 3's receipt's blood writings might be different. But unless the receipt is the same as the memo, which it's not, so no contradiction.\n\nTestimony 3: The blood on the memo is Mia's. That's consistent with the autopsy (her blood).\n\nTestimony 4: Blood on the victim's finger. So she wrote it. That's okay.\n\nTestimony 5: She wrote the killer's name (Maya). So implying Maya is guilty. But if Evidence 4's recorded conversation exonerates her, that's a contradiction between evidence and testimony. But the question requires pairing an evidence with a testimony. The recorded conversation is Evidence 6, which holds the conversation. So Evidence 6 (Maya's cell phone with the conversation) might contradict Testimony 5.\n\nWait, if the conversation recorded on Maya's phone (Evidence 6) shows that Mia was alive after the time of death, then Testimony 5's claim that Mia wrote the name would be impossible. But the autopsy says death at 9 PM, but the conversation could be before that. Alternatively, if the conversation shows that Maya was with Mia at the time of the murder, proving she couldn't have done it, then that would contradict the blood writing testimony.\n\nBut the problem is, without knowing the content of the conversation, we can't be sure. However, the existence of the recording (Evidence 4 and 6) might indicate that there's an alibi or proof of innocence, which would contradict the testimony that the victim wrote Maya's name. So maybe Evidence 6 (the cell phone with the conversation) contradicts Testimony 5 (victim wrote Maya's name as killer).\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo about the recording) and Testimony 5. Because if the recording proves Maya's innocence, then the blood writing is false. But the question requires a direct contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 12: Bellboy's Affidavit describes the man who stayed with Maya. If that man is the real killer, then the blood writing implicating Maya is wrong. But the Bellboy's Affidavit is an evidence, and there's no testimony directly contradicting it except maybe Gumshoe's testimonies. Not sure.\n\nWait another angle: The receipt (Evidence 3) has blood writings. If those writings are different from \"Maya\", that could contradict. But Testimony 2 says the memo had \"Maya\", so unless the receipt's blood is also \"Maya\", but that's not necessarily a contradiction. Unless the receipt's blood is someone else's name.\n\nAlternatively, the Testimony says the blood on the memo is Mia's (Testimony 3), so that's consistent. The receipt's blood could be someone else's, but that's not a contradiction.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the Testimonies again:\n\nTestimony 5: \"Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\"\n\nEvidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) says death was instantaneous, but she may have lived a few minutes after the blow. So writing the name is possible. Not a contradiction.\n\nWait, looking at Evidence 9 (May Testimony): \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\" This is from April May. If the autopsy says the blow was instantaneous, then maybe the victim didn't have time to dodge and run. But the autopsy says death was instantaneous, but the victim may have lived a few minutes. So the attack could have been a surprise, allowing her to dodge briefly. Not a contradiction.\n\nWait, what about Evidence 13: the newspaper clipping about a politician's suicide with \"White\" written. The witness Redd White is involved. If the clipping's \"White\" is pointing to him, maybe his testimony is conflicting. But his testimony isn't listed here.\n\nAlternatively, the \"White\" written on the clipping could be a clue that the real killer is Redd White, contradicting the testimony that Maya did it (from April May's Evidence 9 and Gumshoe's Testimony 5). But again, that's between testimonies and evidence, not a direct pair.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 4. Testimony 4 says blood was on the victim's finger, implying she wrote something. But if the glass shards are from the light stand that was broken during the attack, maybe the blood on her hand is from the glass, not writing. But that's not a contradiction; the blood could be from both the writing and the injury.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is between Testimony 2 (memo has \"Maya\" in blood) and Evidence 3 (receipt with blood writings). If the receipt's blood writings are also \"Maya\", but then there are two items with the same blood writings, but that's not a contradiction. Or if the receipt's blood is someone else's, but the Testimony says the memo's blood is Mia's, so that's okay.\n\nWait, the Testimonies from Gumshoe mention that the blood on the memo is the victim's (Testimony 3). If Evidence 3's receipt also has blood, but that blood is from someone else, then that's okay. Unless the receipt's blood is supposed to be the killer's, but that's not stated.\n\nWait another thought: The Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon. The autopsy says the cause was a blunt object. So that's okay. But the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a light stand. If the murder weapon was the light stand, that would contradict the Thinker being the weapon. But the Thinker is stated as the murder weapon. So if the Glass Shards were part of the weapon, that would be a contradiction. But the description says the Thinker is the murder weapon, so the Glass Shards must be from something else. So no contradiction there.\n\nWait, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. So the light stand was bought, then broken (Evidence 2). But if the murder weapon was the Thinker statue, then the light stand's shards are unrelated. That's okay.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing a simple pair. Let me think again:\n\nTestimony 2 says the memo had \"Maya\" in blood. Testimony 3 confirms the blood is Mia's. Testimony 4 says blood on the finger, so Mia wrote it. Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name (Maya). So all these together suggest Maya is the killer.\n\nBut Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo saying there's a recorded conversation on her phone. If that conversation exonerates her, like showing she was elsewhere, that would contradict the blood evidence. So Evidence 6 (the phone with the conversation) would contradict Testimony 5. But the question requires an evidence and testimony pair. So the evidence would be 6, and testimony 5. But I'm not sure if that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Evidence 3 (the receipt with blood writings) and Testimony 2. If the receipt's blood writings are different from \"Maya\", but the Testimony says the memo had \"Maya\". But unless the receipt's blood is supposed to be the same as the memo, but they are different items, so that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, looking back at the Evidences:\n\nEvidence 3: \"Receipt... Receipt for a glass light stand. The date of purchase is the day before the murder.\"\n\nTestimony 1: Gumshoe found a memo next to the body. Testimony 2 says that memo had \"Maya\" in blood.\n\nSo the memo and the receipt are two different items. The Testimonies talk about the memo, Evidence 3 is the receipt. So no contradiction between them.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is in the Thinker's description: \"Clock in the form of a statue. The clock's gears have been removed. Made by Larry Butz.\"\n\nIf the gears were removed, maybe it couldn't function as a clock, but that's okay. The murder weapon is still the statue part. Not a contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is between Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 5. If the shards are from the murder weapon, but the weapon is the Thinker. So the shards would not be the murder weapon. But that's not a contradiction between the two, just different items.\n\nAlternatively, the Thinker's gears were removed, so maybe it couldn't have been used as a weapon because it's a clock. But the description says it's the murder weapon, so that's okay.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Evidence 9 (May Testimony) and Testimony 5. Because Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name (Maya), but May Testimony (Evidence 9) also says she saw Maya do it. That's not a contradiction, it's consistent.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I need to look for a direct contradiction in the given items.\n\nWait, Testimony 4 says there was blood on the victim's finger. That implies she was holding something, like the pen to write. But the murder weapon is the Thinker. So if she was hit with the Thinker, maybe she couldn't have written after that. But the autopsy says she may have lived a few minutes, so possible. Not a contradiction.\n\nWait another angle: The Thinker was made by Larry Butz. If Larry is a suspect, but there's no testimony about him. Not relevant.\n\nWait, the Bellboy's Affidavit (Evidence 12) describes the man who stayed with Maya. If that man is the killer, then the blood writing is a setup. But that's not a direct contradiction between an evidence and testimony.\n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is between Evidence 3 and Testimony 2. Let me think again:\n\nTestimony 2 says the memo had \"Maya\" in blood. Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood writings. If the receipt is the same as the memo, then the blood writings would be on the receipt, but Testimony 1 says it's a memo, so they are different. So no contradiction.\n\nWait, the receipt's blood writings might say something else. Suppose the receipt's blood says \"Maya\" as well. But that would be redundant. Or maybe it says another name, contradicting the memo. But the Testimonies don't mention the receipt's content. The Testimonies only talk about the memo's \"Maya\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blood on the receipt is from the killer, but the Testimony says the blood on the memo is Mia's. That's okay.\n\nHmm. I'm really not seeing it. Maybe the answer is between Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 4. Testimony 4 says blood on the victim's finger, implying writing. But if the shards cut her, causing blood, but that's possible. Not a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe Evidence 14 (Mia's Memo with names) has the killer's name not being Maya. If the list includes someone else, that would contradict the blood writing. But without knowing the names, can't say.\n\nAlternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) was purchased by the killer, showing they bought the light stand. If the killer is someone else, then the blood writing is a red herring. But that's not a direct contradiction between items.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The most likely pair is Testimony 5 and Evidence 6. Because if the recorded conversation (Evidence 6) shows that Maya wasn't there, then Testimony 5's claim that the victim wrote Maya's name is contradicted. But the question requires an evidence and testimony pair, so the evidence would be 6 and testimony 5. But I'm not 100% sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking again at Testimony 3: \"Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\" So the blood on the memo is Mia's. If Evidence 3's receipt also has blood, but from someone else, that's okay. Unless the receipt's blood is supposed to be the killer's, but that's not stated.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (Bellboy's Affidavit) and Testimony 1. The Affidavit describes a man with Maya in the hotel, which could be the real killer, contradicting the testimony that the memo implicates Maya. But that's between evidence and testimony, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the key is in the two photographs (Evidence 10 and 11) labeled \"DL-6 Incident\". If they show something contradicting the testimonies, but without their content, can't say.\n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is between Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 5. If the shards are from the murder weapon, but the weapon is the Thinker, then that's a contradiction. But the Thinker is the weapon, so the shards must be from something else. Thus, the Testimony that the victim wrote the name (Maya) with the blood on her finger (Testimony 4-5) is about the memo, not the weapon. So no contradiction between shards and the testimony.\n\nWait, maybe Evidence 9 (May Testimony) and Testimony 5 both implicate Maya, so they agree. Not a contradiction.\n\nI think I need to make a guess here. The most likely pair is Evidence 3 (the receipt with blood writings) and Testimony 2 (the memo has \"Maya\" in blood). But they are different items, so not a contradiction. Alternatively, perhaps the blood on the receipt is from someone else, but the Testimonies don't mention that.\n\nWait, another angle: The Thinker's description says it's made by Larry Butz. If Larry is the killer, but there's no testimony about him. Not relevant.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is Evidence 2 and Testimony 4. Because Testimony 4 says blood on the victim's finger (so she was writing), but the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) could have caused the blood, implying she was cut by glass, making it impossible to write. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, the blood on the finger is from the glass shards, so she couldn't write. But that's not necessarily true; maybe the blood from the wound allowed her to write. Not a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the Thinker's gears were removed, making it lighter, so couldn't cause blunt force trauma. But the description says it's the murder weapon, so that's okay.\n\nHmm. I think I'll go with Evidence 3 (Receipt with blood writings) and Testimony 2 (memo with \"Maya\" in blood). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Evidence 9 (May Testimony) and Testimony 5. No.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is between Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 4. Because Testimony 4 says blood on the victim's finger (from writing), but the shards could have caused the wound, but that's not a contradiction. Maybe the blood on the finger is from the glass shards, but she still could write.\n\nWait, maybe the Thinker's gears being removed means it can't function as a clock, but that's okay. The murder weapon is the statue part. Not a contradiction.\n\nHmm. I'm really not seeing it. Maybe the correct answer is between Evidence 12 and Testimony 1. The Bellboy's Affidavit describes someone else with Maya, contradicting the testimony that she was alone? Not sure.\n\nWait, the Testimonies from Gumshoe (Testimony 1) says the memo was next to the body. Evidence 3's receipt is a separate item. Not a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the receipt's purchase date is the day before the murder. If the murder was on 9/5, the receipt is from 9/4. If the light stand was used in the murder, that's okay. Not a contradiction.\n\nHmm. I think I have to pick the most plausible one. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (victim wrote the killer's name) and Evidence 4 (the recorded conversation which might exonerate Maya). So the evidence is 4 and testimony 5. But the question requires the pair in the JSON format. Alternatively, Evidence 6 and Testimony 5. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the user's example output was {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. Maybe the intended answer is between Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 3. But why?\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says the blood on the memo is Mia's. If the Glass Shards are part of the murder weapon, but the murder weapon is the Thinker, then the shards are unrelated. Not a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blood on the memo (Testimony 2-3) is Mia's, but the Glass Shards have someone else's blood. Not a contradiction.\n\nHmm. I think I'll go with Evidence 3 and Testimony 2. If the receipt is the same as the memo, but they are different items. But since they are different, no contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (Bellboy's Affidavit describing the man with Maya) and Testimony 1 (Gumshoe found the memo). Not directly.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is Evidence 2 and Testimony 5. I'll have to make a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the Thinker's gears being removed mean it can't be a weapon, but the description says it is, so that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, another thought: The Thinker is described as \"made by Larry Butz\". If Larry is the killer, but there's no testimony about him. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) might show that the murder couldn't have happened as described in the testimonies, but without details, can't say.\n\nHmm. I think the most plausible contradiction is between Evidence 3 (the receipt with blood writings) and Testimony 2 (the memo has \"Maya\" in blood). If the receipt's blood writings are different, but they are separate items, so no. Alternatively, if the receipt's blood is someone else's name, but the Testimony says the memo has \"Maya\". Not a contradiction.\n\nWait, I think I'll go with the example given in the user's instruction. The example was {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. Maybe the intended answer is Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 3 (blood on memo is Mia's). But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Testimony 3 says the blood is Mia's, but the Glass Shards' blood is someone else's, but that's not a contradiction.\n\nHmm. I'm giving up and will choose the most likely pair. Maybe Evidence 3 (receipt) and Testimony 2 (memo), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Evidence 9 and Testimony 5. No. \n\nWait, the Thinker's description says it's the murder weapon, but the autopsy says the cause was a blunt object. So that's consistent. No contradiction.\n\nWait, the Thinker is a statue made into a clock, but the gears are removed. If the gears being removed made it lighter, maybe it couldn't cause the blunt force trauma. But that's a stretch. The statue itself is still heavy enough.\n\nHmm. I think I'll have to pick the first possible pair I thought of, which might be Evidence 3 and Testimony 2. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 5 and Evidence 6. \n\nWait, the Thinker's description says it was made by Larry Butz. If the receipt (Evidence 3) was for purchasing the Thinker, but it's for a glass light stand. So the murder weapon was bought separately. Not a contradiction.\n\nHmm. I think I'll go with the example's structure. The user's example had evidence 2 and testimony 3. Maybe the answer is Evidence 2 and Testimony 3. But why? \n\nWait, Testimony 3 says the blood on the memo is Mia's. If the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) have blood from someone else, but that's okay. Not a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blood on the memo (Testimony 3) is Mia's, but the Glass Shards' blood is the killer's. No contradiction.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer must be Evidence 2 and Testimony 4. Because Testimony 4 says blood on the victim's finger (so she was writing), but the Glass Shards might have caused the blood, making it impossible. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Thinker's gears were removed, so it couldn't be used as a weapon, contradicting the description that it is the murder weapon. But the description explicitly says it's the murder weapon, so that's not a contradiction.\n\nI think I'll have to make a guess. I'll go with Evidence 3 (Receipt with blood writings) and Testimony 2 (memo has \"Maya\" in blood). But they are different items, so no contradiction. Maybe the answer is between Evidence 9 and Testimony 5. No, they agree.\n\nWait, the Testimonies from Gumshoe (Testimony 5) says the victim wrote the killer's name. If the killer's name is not Maya, but someone else, like Redd White, then the blood writing is wrong. But how does that relate to an evidence?\n\nThe newspaper clipping (Evidence 13) has \"White\" written, pointing to Redd White. If his testimony contradicts the blood evidence, but there's no testimony from him listed. \n\nHmm. I think I'll have to pick the pair between Evidence 12 (Bellboy's Affidavit describing someone else with Maya) and Testimony 1 (Gumshoe found the memo). No, not a direct contradiction.\n\nI think I've exhausted all options. The most plausible is that the blood writings on the memo (Testimony 2-3) are contradicted by the recorded conversation (Evidence 6). So the pair would be Evidence 6 and Testimony 5. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the answer is between Evidence 2 and Testimony 3. \n\nWait, another angle: The receipt (Evidence 3) was found at the scene. If the blood on it is the killer's, then the memo's blood (victim's) points to Maya, but the receipt's blood could be the real killer. That would mean two different people, contradicting the testimony that the victim wrote the killer's name (Maya). But unless the receipt's blood is another name, which isn't stated. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with the first possible pair I thought of, even if uncertain. The most likely is between Evidence 3 and Testimony 2. But since they are different items, maybe not. Alternatively, the answer is Evidence 2 and Testimony 3. \n\nWait, no. I'll just have to pick one. Maybe the answer is Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 4 (blood on finger). If the shards caused the blood on the finger, making it impossible to write, but that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, the Thinker's gears were removed, so it can't be used as a weapon, but the description says it is. No contradiction.\n\nHmm. I think I'm missing something obvious. Let me read all again quickly.\n\nWait, the Thinker's description says it's the murder weapon. The autopsy says the cause was blunt force trauma. So that's okay. The Glass Shards are from a light stand. The receipt is for that stand. The blood writings on the memo (Testimony 2) say \"Maya\", and the blood is Mia's (Testimony 3). The recorded conversation (Evidence 4/6) could show that Maya wasn't there, contradicting the blood evidence. So the evidence is 6 and testimony 5. \n\nBut since the user's example uses numbers, maybe the answer is Evidence 3 and Testimony 2. \n\nWait, no. I think I'll go with Evidence 3 and Testimony 2. But I'm really not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Evidence 9 (May Testimony) and Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's). But they both agree.\n\nWait, the user's example output uses evidence 2 and testimony 3. Maybe the answer is between Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 3 (blood on memo is Mia's). No connection.\n\nHmm. I think I'll give up and make a guess based on the first possible pair I thought of that makes sense: the recorded conversation (Evidence 6) contradicting Testimony 5. So the JSON would be {\"evidence\":6, \"testimony\":5}. \n\nAlternatively, the Thinker's gears being removed means it can't be a weapon, but the description says it is. So contradiction between Evidence 1's description and the autopsy's cause? No, because it's a statue.\n\nHmm. I think I'll settle on Evidence 3 (Receipt with blood writings) and Testimony 2 (memo has \"Maya\" in blood). Even though they are different items, maybe the blood writings on the receipt are different, but the question requires only one pair. \n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (Bellboy's Affidavit describes the man who was with Maya) and Testimony 1 (the memo found). Not directly.\n\nHmm. I think I'll go with the Thinker's gears being removed meaning it can't be a weapon, but that's not a contradiction. \n\nWait, the Thinker is described as the murder weapon, so that's okay. \n\nI think I have to give up and choose one. The most likely is Evidence 3 and Testimony 2. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, the answer is Evidence 2 and Testimony 3. \n\nWait, maybe the blood on the memo (Testimony 3) is Mia's, but the Glass Shards' blood is someone else's, but that's not a contradiction. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with the example's structure and pick Evidence 2 and Testimony 3. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the user's example uses 2 and 3. Maybe that's the answer they want. But why?\n\nEvidence 2 is Glass Shards. Testimony 3 says the blood on the memo is Mia's. Not related. \n\nHmm. Maybe the correct pair is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 4. Because the recorded conversation (Evidence 4) could show Maya wasn't the killer, contradicting Testimony 5. So {\"evidence\":4, \"testimony\":5}. \n\nYes, that makes sense. The memo (Evidence 4) says there's a recorded conversation that might exonerate Maya, contradicting the testimony that the victim wrote her name. \n\nSo the answer is Evidence 4 and Testimony 5. \n\nWait, Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo which states the conversation is recorded. The Testimony 5 says the victim wrote Maya's name. If the conversation proves Maya's innocence, then that's a contradiction. \n\nYes, this is likely. So the JSON would be {\"evidence\":4, \"testimony\":5}.\n</think>\n"

    "cot": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. The previous answer was {\"evidence\":4, \"testimony\":5}, but looking at the current question, maybe there's a different contradiction here.\n\nFirst, let me go through all the evidence and testimonies again to make sure I don't miss anything. \n\nStarting with the characters: Mia Fey is the victim, Maya her sister, April is a witness who says she saw Maya commit the murder, etc. The key here is to find where an evidence conflicts with a testimony.\n\nLooking at the evidences:\n\nEvidence 4 is Maya's Memo which says there's a recorded conversation on her cell phone. Evidence 6 is Maya's Cell Phone, which holds that conversation. So those two seem to corroborate each other. But maybe there's something else conflicting?\n\nTestimonies are from April May (character 4) in Testimonies 0-4. Let's see what each says:\n\nTestimony 0: \"I did see everything! I did!\" \u2013 April claims to have witnessed the entire event.\n\nTestimony 1: The victim dodged the first attack and ran to the right. This matches Evidence 9 (May Testimony) which says \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\" Wait, Evidence 9 is labeled as \"May Testimony,\" but the description is similar to April's testimony. Wait, but in the current setup, the testimonies listed under Testimonies are all from April. Wait, checking the Testimonies section again:\n\nWait, the Testimonies listed here are:\n\nTestimony 0: Person: April\n\nTestimony 1: Person: April\n\nTestimony 2: Person: April\n\nTestimony 3: Person: April\n\nTestimony 4: Person: April\n\nSo all these testimonies are from April May. But there's also Evidence 9, which is \"May Testimony\" (probably a typo for Maya's testimony?), but the description is similar to April's testimony. Wait, but in the current problem's Testimonies section, the user provided the testimonies as from April. The Evidence 9 is separate. Let me check again:\n\nWait, the user provided the Testimonies section with Testimony 0 to 4, all from April. Evidence 9 is \"May Testimony\" with the description: \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\" So that's a separate testimony, perhaps from Maya? But in the characters, Maya is the sister found at the scene. However, in the current problem's Testimonies, April's testimonies are Testimonies 0-4. \n\nWait, maybe the Evidence 9 is conflicting with something else. Alternatively, let's look at other evidences and testimonies.\n\nLooking at Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report says that death was instantaneous, but the victim may have lived for a few minutes after being hit. Wait, that's a bit conflicting in itself, but maybe that's just the report's detail. \n\nEvidence 3 is a receipt with blood written on the back. The receipt is for a glass light stand. The blood is the victim's, per Testimonies 2-4 by Gumshoe in the previous problem, but in this problem's Testimonies, those are different. Wait, in the current problem, the Testimonies are from April. So maybe the previous problem's testimonies are different. Wait, I need to focus only on the current problem given here. \n\nWait, the current problem's Testimonies are only Testimony 0 to 4, all from April. So the key is to see if any evidence contradicts April's testimony. \n\nApril Testimony 3 says that the girl in hippie clothes (Maya) hit Mia with the Thinker statue-clock. Evidence 1 is \"The Thinker\" as the murder weapon. So that's consistent. \n\nBut looking at the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5): the cause of death is a single blunt force trauma. If the weapon was The Thinker (Evidence 1), then that's consistent. But maybe the time of death? The time is 9/5 at 9 PM. But perhaps there's a contradiction elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking at Evidence 4: Maya's Memo says there's a recorded conversation on her cell phone (Evidence 6). If that conversation exists, then maybe it contradicts April's testimony that she saw Maya commit the murder. But that's more of a conflict between testimonies, not evidence vs testimony.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle. The Testimonies from April say that the victim dodged an attack and ran to the right, then was caught. Evidence 9 (May Testimony) has the same description. But if Evidence 9 is actually Maya's testimony, which might be conflicting with April's? But the user says to find an evidence and testimony that contradict. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 3 (Receipt with blood written in back). Testimonies from Gumshoe in the previous problem had blood on the receipt and finger, but in this problem's Testimonies, that's not present. Maybe the current problem's Testimonies don't include those, so maybe that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, maybe the key is in the Testimonies from April and the Evidence related to the cell phone. \n\nApril's Testimony 3 says she saw Maya hit Mia with the Thinker. But if the cell phone recording (Evidence 6) has a conversation between Mia and Maya, maybe that shows they were together at a time conflicting with the murder? For example, if the conversation was recorded after the time of death, that would mean Maya couldn't have done it. But without the actual content of the conversation, it's hard to say. But the existence of the memo (Evidence 4) and the cell phone (Evidence 6) might indicate that there's a recording that could exonerate Maya, contradicting April's testimony. But that's more of an indirect contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Testimonies from April: Testimony 4 says the weapon was \"The Thinker\" clock. Evidence 1 describes it as the murder weapon. So that's consistent. \n\nWait, maybe the Autopsy Report's note that the victim may have lived for a few minutes after being hit. If April's testimony says that the victim was struck after dodging, but if the victim lived a few minutes, maybe there's inconsistency in the timeline? Not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again. The user wants one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict.\n\nWait, looking at Evidence 12: Bellboy's Affidavit describes the man who stayed with Miss May in the hotel. Miss May might be April May? Or Maya Fey? The name is a bit ambiguous. If \"Miss May\" refers to April May, then the Bellboy's Affidavit might link her to the hotel room where the wiretap (Evidence 7) was found. Not sure.\n\nWait, Evidence 13 is a newspaper clipping about a politician's suicide with \"White\" written on top. Maybe relates to Redd White, but not sure of contradiction.\n\nEvidence 14 is Mia's memo with a list of names. Not obviously conflicting.\n\nWait, going back to the Testimonies from April. Testimony 3 says she saw Maya hit Mia with the weapon. But the murder weapon (Evidence 1) is The Thinker, a statue/clock made by Larry Butz. If the weapon was that, then that's consistent. But perhaps the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says the cause was blunt force trauma, which matches the weapon. \n\nWait, maybe the key is in the Testimonies from April and the Autopsy Report. The Autopsy says death was instantaneous, but maybe April's testimony implies that there was a struggle, so the victim was moving after being hit. But the report says \"May have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\" Wait, but \"instantaneous\" might mean it was quick, but the report clarifies that there was a possibility of a few minutes. Not a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blood on the receipt (Evidence 3) and the Testimonies about the blood on the memo and finger (but those Testimonies are from the previous problem, not this one). In this current problem, the Testimonies are only from April, so maybe there's no blood evidence mentioned here. \n\nWait, the current Testimonies do not mention the blood on the receipt or the memo. The only blood mentioned in this problem's Testimonies is from April's account of the murder. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look for another angle. \n\nLooking at Evidence 10 and 11: the photographs with DL-6 Incident. Not sure how that connects yet.\n\nWait, Evidence 7 is a wiretap found in Miss May's hotel room. If Miss May is April May, then she had a wiretap, implying she was eavesdropping, which might mean she was present and could have seen the murder, but perhaps the wiretap's presence indicates she was involved? Not sure.\n\nWait, Testimony 1 from April says the victim ran to the right after dodging. Evidence 9 (May Testimony) says the same. If Evidence 9 is actually Maya's testimony, then Maya is contradicting April's account? But the question is about evidence vs testimony. So if April says she saw Maya do it, but Maya's testimony (Evidence 9) describes the same events as April, that would support April, but maybe the details differ?\n\nWait, Evidence 9's description is: \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\" That's exactly what April's Testimony 1 and 2 say. So they are in agreement. So no contradiction there.\n\nHmm. Maybe looking at Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo) and April's Testimony. If the Memo says there's a recorded conversation on Maya's cell phone (Evidence 6), then if that conversation shows that Maya was with Mia at a different time, that would contradict April's testimony. But without the content of the recording, we can't be sure. Unless the Memo itself contradicts something.\n\nWait, maybe the Memo (Evidence 4) says the conversation is recorded, but the cell phone (Evidence 6) might not have it, but that's not stated here. The description of Evidence 6 just says it holds the conversation. So they support each other. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Testimonies from April (Testimony 3) say that Maya hit Mia with the weapon, but Evidence 1's description says the Thinker's gears were removed. If the gears were removed, maybe it couldn't be used as a weapon? Wait, the description says it's the murder weapon. So that's okay. \n\nWait, the Thinker is the murder weapon, so that's consistent with the testimony. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something obvious. Let me check the Testimonies again:\n\nApril Testimony 0: I saw everything.\n\nTestimony 1: Victim dodged, ran right.\n\nTestimony 2: Maya ran after her.\n\nTestimony 3: Hit her with the weapon, saw it.\n\nTestimony 4: The weapon was The Thinker.\n\nEvidence 5's Autopsy says death was from a blunt object, which matches the weapon. \n\nEvidence 9's testimony matches April's account. \n\nEvidence 4 and 6 relate to a recorded conversation. If that conversation shows something conflicting, but since we don't have its content, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, the user might have a typo in the Testimonies. Let me check again the Testimonies provided in the current problem:\n\nTestimonies:\n\nTestimony 0\nTestimony: I did see everything! I did!\nPerson: April\nTestimony 1\nTestimony: The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.\nPerson: April\nTestimony 2\nTestimony: Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...\nPerson: April\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!\nPerson: April\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think?\nPerson: April\n\nSo April's testimony says that the victim (Mia) was hit with the Thinker by Maya. \n\nNow, looking at Evidence 5's Autopsy Report: cause is blunt force trauma, death instantaneous, but may have lived a few minutes. Wait, if the victim was hit and then ran, maybe the timeline doesn't fit. But the autopsy says death was instantaneous, so maybe she didn't live long. But the report says \"may have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\" That's a contradiction? Or is it possible that the blow caused death, but she moved before dying? \n\nWait, the description says: \"Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\" That seems contradictory. Wait, that's an internal contradiction in the evidence itself. The autopsy report says death was instantaneous, but also says she might have lived a few minutes. That's conflicting. But the question is about evidence vs testimony contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe April's testimony implies that the victim was able to run after being hit, which would require her to be alive for a bit, which aligns with the autopsy's \"may have lived a few minutes,\" so that's not a contradiction. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me think again. \n\nAnother angle: Evidence 3 is a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before, with blood on the back. If April's testimony says the murder weapon was the Thinker, then the glass light stand (Evidence 2, the shards) might be unrelated. But the Thinker is the murder weapon. So the receipt (Evidence 3) for the glass light stand might be a red herring, but the blood on the receipt's back is the victim's blood (from previous testimonies, but not in this problem's Testimonies). \n\nWait, in this current problem's Testimonies, there's no mention of blood on the receipt. The blood on the receipt and the memo were from the previous problem's Gumshoe testimonies, but not here. So maybe that's not relevant now. \n\nWait, maybe the key is in the Testimonies and the Floor Plans (Evidence 8). If the floor plans show something that contradicts April's account of the victim's movements. But without seeing the floor plans, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 13 is a newspaper clipping about a politician's suicide with \"White\" written on top. The character Redd White's name is mentioned, so maybe that's a clue, but not sure how it conflicts. \n\nWait, the user's previous answer was {\"evidence\":4, \"testimony\":5}, but in this problem, Testimony 5 isn't present. The current Testimonies are numbered 0-4. So maybe that's not applicable here. \n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo) and April's Testimony. If the memo says there's a recording of Maya and Mia talking, and if that recording contradicts April's testimony. For example, if the recording shows them together at the time of the murder, proving Maya couldn't have done it. But since we don't have the content, maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the memo (Evidence 4) says the conversation is recorded on Maya's phone (Evidence 6). If the phone is missing or doesn't have it, that would be a problem, but the description says it does. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look at the Evidence numbers again. Let me list all evidences and see which might conflict with the testimonies:\n\nEvidence 0: Attorney's Badge \u2013 not relevant.\n\nEvidence 1: The Thinker \u2013 murder weapon, matches testimony.\n\nEvidence 2: Glass Shards \u2013 from a light stand. If the murder weapon was the Thinker, then these shards might be from something else. But the receipt (Evidence 3) is for the glass light stand, purchased the day before. If April's testimony says the weapon was the Thinker, then the glass shards might be from a different incident. But unless the receipt's blood is the victim's, but that's from previous testimonies not here. \n\nWait, the current problem's Testimonies don't mention blood on the receipt or the memo. So maybe the contradiction is between Evidence 3 (the receipt with blood on back) and April's testimony. But since the Testimonies here don't mention the blood, maybe not. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is in the Testimonies and Evidence 5's autopsy report. If April says the victim was hit by the Thinker, but the autopsy says the cause was something else? No, it says blunt force trauma, which matches. \n\nWait, another thought: the Thinker's gears were removed (Evidence 1). If the gears were removed, maybe it couldn't function as a clock, but it's still a statue. So it could still be used as a weapon. So no contradiction there. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for the simplest contradiction. \n\nWait, the Testimonies from April say that the victim was hit with The Thinker. Evidence 1 is the murder weapon as The Thinker, so that's consistent. \n\nThe only other possibility is the Memo (Evidence 4) and the Testimony about the blood. Wait, in the previous problem's Testimonies (not here), Gumshoe found a memo with \"Maya\" in blood. But in this problem's Testimonies, April's testimonies don't mention that. \n\nWait, maybe the Evidence 3 (the receipt with blood on the back) is a clue. If the blood on the receipt is the victim's, then that would imply that the receipt was handled by the victim, but if the receipt is for a glass light stand purchased the day before, maybe the killer used that as a weapon instead of the Thinker. But April says the weapon was the Thinker. So that's a contradiction between the receipt's purchase (implying the light stand was bought and maybe used) and April's testimony that the weapon was the Thinker. \n\nWait, but Evidence 1 clearly states that the Thinker is the murder weapon. So the glass shards (Evidence 2) might be from the light stand, but the actual weapon was the Thinker. So the receipt (Evidence 3) being for the glass light stand might be a red herring, but there's no contradiction between the evidence and testimony unless the weapon was supposed to be the light stand. \n\nAlternatively, if the receipt's blood is the victim's, then the victim was handling the receipt, but the purchase was the day before. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Testimonies from April say the weapon was The Thinker (Testimony 4), but Evidence 1 says it's a clock with gears removed. If the gears were removed, maybe it's not a functional clock, but still a statue. So that's okay. \n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Let me try to see if any evidence directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nLooking at Evidence 9 (May Testimony): \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\" This matches April's Testimony 1 and 2. So they agree. \n\nEvidence 14 is Mia's memo with a list of names. Maybe the names include the killer, but without knowing the names, can't say. \n\nEvidence 12 is the Bellboy's affidavit describing a man with Miss May in the hotel. If Miss May is April, then that could link her to the scene, but not necessarily contradicting her testimony. \n\nEvidence 7 is a wiretap in Miss May's room. If April was there, maybe she placed it to eavesdrop, implying she was present. \n\nWait, maybe the key is in the Testimonies and Evidence 14 (Mia's memo with names). If the memo includes Maya's name, that might contradict April's accusation? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo about the recording) and April's Testimony that she saw Maya commit the murder. If the recording shows Maya wasn't there, that would contradict April, but since we don't have the content, maybe not. \n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Evidence 3 (the receipt with blood on the back) and April's testimony. If the receipt's blood is the victim's, then the victim was writing on the receipt's back, implying she was alive after purchasing the light stand. But the purchase was the day before the murder. Not sure how that conflicts. \n\nHmm. I'm not seeing an obvious contradiction. Maybe I need to consider the previous problem's answer and see if that applies here. The previous answer was Evidence4 (Maya's Memo) and Testimony5 (which in the previous problem was \"Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\"). But in this problem, Testimony5 doesn't exist. \n\nWait, perhaps in this problem, there's a similar contradiction between Evidence4 and another testimony. Let me check again:\n\nEvidence4: Maya's Memo says there's a recording on her phone (Evidence6). Testimony0 says April claims to have seen everything. If the recording shows that Maya was elsewhere, then that contradicts April's testimony. But since we don't have the recording's content, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, if the Memo (Evidence4) is found with the victim, then that would place Maya near the victim, but the Memo is from Maya. Not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the key is in the Testimonies and the Autopsy Report (Evidence5). The autopsy says the victim may have lived a few minutes after being hit, but April's testimony says she was struck immediately after dodging. If the victim ran, then the blow came after, so maybe she did live a few minutes, which matches. So no contradiction there. \n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I need to think of the simplest pair. Let me list possible candidates:\n\n- Evidence3 (receipt with blood) and Testimony (but none here mention blood in this problem's Testimonies). \n\n- Evidence9 (May Testimony) vs Testimony from April: they agree, so not.\n\n- Evidence4 and Testimony about the cell phone: not conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe Evidence10 and 11 (the photographs with DL-6) are related to another case, but not here.\n\nAlternatively, the Testimony that the victim ran to the right (Testimony1) and the Floor Plans (Evidence8). If the floor plan doesn't allow that path, but we can't see it.\n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is between Evidence9 (May Testimony) and April's Testimony? But they match. \n\nWait, maybe the Bellboy's Affidavit (Evidence12) describes a man with Miss May (April?) in the hotel. If the murder happened at Fey & Co. (Evidence8's floor plan), then April being in the hotel doesn't conflict with her testimony. \n\nAlternatively, the newspaper clipping (Evidence13) with \"White\" on it. If Redd White's name is written, maybe he's involved, but not contradicting April's testimony.\n\nWait a minute! Looking at Evidence13: the newspaper clipping about a politician's suicide with \"White\" written on top. The character Redd White's name is mentioned. Maybe April's testimony is influenced by this, but not a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, the \"White\" on the clipping could be a clue that Redd White is involved, but not directly conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the key is in the Testimonies and the Thinker's description. The Thinker is a clock with gears removed. If the autopsy report mentions the time of death (9PM on 9/5), maybe the clock's gears being removed mean it couldn't tell the time, but the murder time is known. That doesn't conflict.\n\nHmm. I'm really not seeing a clear contradiction here. Maybe I missed something in the initial scan.\n\nWait, looking at Evidence0: Attorney's Badge. Mia is the chief attorney, so she would have it. The badge is evidence, but how does it contradict a testimony?\n\nApril's testimony says Maya used the Thinker to kill Mia. If Mia had her badge, maybe it's a red herring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Memo (Evidence4) and the Testimony that the victim wrote the killer's name (but that's from previous problem's Testimony5, not here).\n\nWait, in this problem's Testimonies, there's no mention of the victim writing anything. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, the only possible contradiction I can think of is between Evidence3 (the receipt for the glass light stand with blood on the back) and April's testimony that the weapon was the Thinker. If the blood on the receipt is the victim's, then the victim was handling the receipt (for the glass light stand) which was purchased the day before. If the glass light stand was broken (Evidence2), maybe that's the actual weapon, contradicting April's testimony about the Thinker. \n\nBut Evidence1 clearly states that the Thinker is the murder weapon, so that would mean the glass shards are from another object. So the receipt's purchase might be a red herring. But if the receipt's blood is the victim's, then the victim was involved in purchasing the light stand, but that doesn't contradict April's testimony about the weapon being the Thinker. \n\nHmm. I'm going around in circles. Maybe the correct answer is between Evidence4 and Testimony0? Not sure. \n\nWait, the user's previous answer was Evidence4 and Testimony5, which in the previous problem's Testimony5 was \"Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\" So if the victim couldn't have written anything because the murder was instantaneous, but the autopsy report says she may have lived a few minutes. That's a contradiction between the blood memo (Evidence3?) and the autopsy. But in this problem's setup, maybe that's not present. \n\nAlternatively, in this problem's Evidence5's autopsy report, it says death was instantaneous but may have lived a few minutes. That's a contradiction within the evidence, but the question wants evidence vs testimony. \n\nWait, maybe the Testimony that the victim dodged and ran (Testimony1) implies she was alive after the initial attack, which matches the autopsy's \"may have lived a few minutes,\" so no contradiction. \n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe the answer is between Evidence9 (May Testimony) and April's Testimony? But they agree. \n\nWait, maybe the Bellboy's Affidavit (Evidence12) says that a man was with Miss May (April) in the hotel. If April was there, maybe she couldn't have been at the murder scene, but that requires knowing the timeline. \n\nAlternatively, if the murder happened at 9PM, and the Bellboy's Affidavit places April elsewhere, that would contradict her testimony of seeing it. But without dates in the Affidavit's description, can't confirm. \n\nHmm. I think I need to make a educated guess here. The most plausible contradiction might be between Evidence3 (the receipt with blood) and April's testimony. If the blood on the receipt is the victim's, then it suggests the victim was involved in purchasing the light stand, but April says the killer was Maya. However, without explicit testimony about the receipt, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Thinker's description (Evidence1) says it was made by Larry Butz, and if April's testimony doesn't mention that, but that's not a contradiction. \n\nWait, another angle: the Testimonies from April say the killer was Maya, but the Memo (Evidence4) implies Maya had a recorded conversation with Mia, which could exonerate her. If the conversation shows they were together, that contradicts April's testimony. But since we don't have the content, maybe the existence of the recording is the contradiction. For example, if the recording proves Maya wasn't there, but the evidence just says it exists. \n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is that the Memo (Evidence4) says the recording exists, but the Testimonies don't mention it, so it's not a direct contradiction. \n\nHmm. I'm really not seeing it. Given that the previous answer was 4 and 5, maybe the current problem has a similar one. Let me check again:\n\nWait, the current Testimonies don't have a Testimony5, so maybe Testimony4 is the last one. \n\nTestimony4 says the weapon was The Thinker. Evidence1 confirms that. \n\nEvidence9 (May Testimony) matches April's Testimony. \n\nEvidence14's list of names in Mia's handwriting: if Maya's name is there, maybe she's a suspect, but not contradicting April's claim. \n\nAlternatively, the key is in the Testimonies and Evidence5's autopsy report. If the victim was hit and then ran, that would mean she was still alive, which aligns with the autopsy's \"may have lived a few minutes,\" so no contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Evidence5's \"death was instantaneous\" and the Testimonies implying she was hit after dodging, meaning she was alive for a bit. But the autopsy says it was instantaneous but allows for a few minutes. That's a contradiction within the evidence, but the question wants evidence vs testimony. \n\nAlternatively, \"instantaneous\" means immediate death, contradicting the possibility of living a few minutes. That's an internal contradiction in the autopsy report (Evidence5), but the user wants evidence and testimony pair. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is between Evidence5 and Testimony1. If the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then the victim couldn't have dodged and run, but the Testimony says she did. So that's a contradiction. \n\nWait, that's possible! Let me think:\n\nTestimony1: \"The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.\"\n\nEvidence5's Autopsy Report says death was instantaneous. If death was instantaneous, she couldn't have dodged and run after being hit. So that's a contradiction between the testimony and the evidence. \n\nYes, that makes sense. If the autopsy says death was instantaneous, the victim couldn't have moved after being hit. But the testimony says she dodged and ran, implying she was alive and moving after the initial attack (which might have been the fatal one). \n\nSo the contradiction is between Testimony1 and Evidence5. \n\nSo the answer would be {\"evidence\":5, \"testimony\":1}.\n</think>\n\nThe contradiction arises between **Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report)** and **Testimony 1 (April's statement)**. The autopsy report states that Mia's death was instantaneous, yet Testimony 1 claims the victim \"dodged the first attack and ran off to the right\" after being struck. If death was instantaneous, Mia could not have moved or dodged an attack post-injury. \n"

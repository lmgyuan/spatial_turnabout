That's different from the forehead mentioned in the testimony. If the testimony says the bullet hit the forehead from the front, but the autopsy says it was the right temple, that's a contradiction. \n\nWait, but the testimony says \"square in the forehead\" from the front. The autopsy report says \"right temple\". The location is different. So that's a contradiction between Evidence 11 and Testimony 4.\n\nAnother point: Evidence 14 (Pistol) mentions two rounds were fired. Testimony 4 mentions a single shot. But the testimony only mentions one shot leading to death, but the pistol had two fired rounds. However, the contradiction between the wound location is more direct.\n\nSo the main contradiction is between Testimony 4 (shot to forehead) and Evidence 11 (death by bullet to the right temple). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be {\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 4}.\n</think>\n"

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find a contradiction between one evidence and one testimony. Let me go through the characters, evidences, and testimonies again carefully.\n\nFirst, the characters. The main ones here are Phoenix Wright, Trucy, Dr. Hickfield, Guy Eldoon, Plum Kitaki, Alita Tiala, Wocky Kitaki (defendant), Pal Meraktis (victim), Winfred Kitaki, and Wesley Stickler (the witness). The victim, Meraktis, died pulling a noodle stand, and the defendant is Wocky. The witness is Stickler, who seems to have seen something.\n\nLooking at the testimonies from Stickler. Testimony 4 says that after the shot, the defendant (Wocky) tossed the pistol aside and fled. The evidence that might contradict this would be something related to the weapon's location or handling. \n\nLooking at the evidences, Evidence 14 is the Pistol. Its description says it was left at the crime scene, two rounds fired, and fingerprints were wiped. If Stickler says Wocky tossed it aside, that would mean the pistol should be there, which matches. But the key point is the fingerprints. If Wocky threw it, his prints might be on it, but the evidence says the fingerprints were wiped. However, the Knife (Evidence 10) has Wocky's prints. The Pistol's prints are wiped, so maybe someone else handled it after. \n\nWait, but Testimony 4 says Wocky tossed it, so if he did, his prints might still be on it unless he wiped them. But the evidence says the fingerprints were wiped. So if Stickler says Wocky was the one who tossed it, but the pistol's prints are wiped (maybe by someone else), that could be a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the fact that the pistol was left at the scene supports Stickler's testimony, but the wiped prints might suggest someone else handled it after. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 19, the Bullet found in the safe, squished from impact with the back. If the bullet went into the back of the safe, that would mean the shot was fired from the other side, maybe the victim was facing away. But Stickler's testimony (Testimony 2) says the victim turned towards Stickler's voice before the shot, so the bullet would have to hit from the front. But if the bullet is in the back of the safe, that might mean the shot was from behind. Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) says cause of death was a bullet to the right temple. If the victim was facing Stickler, the shot would hit the front, but the bullet being in the back of the safe might indicate the direction of the shot. Hmm, maybe that's a contradiction between the Autopsy and the Bullet evidence with Stickler's testimony?\n\nWait, let me check Evidence 11 again: Meraktis's Autopsy Report says cause of death is a bullet to the right temple. If Stickler says the victim turned towards him and then was shot, then the bullet would enter the front (right temple), but the bullet being embedded in the back of the safe (Evidence 19) might mean the shot was fired from the other side. But maybe the safe is behind the victim, so the bullet went through the victim and into the safe? That could still align. Not sure.\n\nLooking back at the Testimony 4: Stickler says the defendant tossed the pistol aside and fled. The Pistol (Evidence 14) was left at the scene, so that part matches. But the fact that the fingerprints were wiped might contradict if Stickler claims Wocky was the one handling it. If Wocky threw it, he would have touched it, so his prints should be there unless he wiped them. But the evidence says the prints were wiped, which could be done by Wocky himself, but the testimony doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe another evidence contradicts.\n\nWait, Evidence 10 is a Knife with Wocky's prints. If the murder weapon was the pistol, then the knife might be irrelevant, but maybe Stickler's testimony about the pistol being the weapon used is correct, but the presence of the knife with Wocky's prints might suggest he had it, but the actual murder was with the pistol. Not a direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 19's bullet being squished in the back of the safe. If the victim was shot in the right temple, the bullet path would go into the body, but if the safe is behind the victim, the bullet would exit and hit the safe. That could make sense. So maybe that's not a contradiction.\n\nLooking again at the testimonies, Testimony 4 says the defendant tossed the pistol aside and fled. The Pistol was left at the scene (Evidence 14), so that's consistent. The wiped fingerprints might suggest someone else handled it after, but that's not a direct contradiction. The contradiction might be elsewhere.\n\nWait, another angle: Evidence 5 is a cell phone found under a car at the clinic, belonging to Stickler. If Stickler was the witness who saw the incident, why was his phone at the clinic? Maybe he was there, but his testimony says he was in the park. Wait, the testimonies from Stickler are about being in the park. Wait, let's check his testimonies again:\n\nTestimonies from Stickler (the witness):\n\nTestimony 0: He was shopping and saw them in the park.\n\nTestimony 1-4: He saw the defendant and victim in the park, with the defendant shooting. \n\nBut Evidence 5 shows his phone was found at the Meraktis Clinic garage. If he was really at the park, why is his phone at the clinic? That's a contradiction. So Testimony 0 (being in the park) vs. Evidence 5 (phone at clinic). \n\nWait, that's a good point. If Stickler's testimony says he was in the park, but his phone was found at the clinic, that suggests he was actually at the clinic, contradicting his alibi. \n\nSo the contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Cell Phone, found at the clinic, his property) and Testimony 0 (he was in the park, not the clinic). \n\nWait, but the question is to pick one pair. The user's previous examples had similar structures. So the answer would be evidence 5 and testimony 0. But let me confirm.\n\nYes, Evidence 5 says Stickler's phone was found at the clinic garage. Testimony 0 says he was in the park. So that's a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another one. Let me check again. \n\nAnother possibility: Testimony 2 says the victim turned towards Stickler's voice before the shot, implying the bullet entered the front. The Autopsy says right temple (front), and the bullet in the safe's back might mean it went through, but that's possible. Not a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 16 (Alita's sandals with big toe print) and Evidence 3 (Slippers with big toe print). If both have the same print, maybe someone's, but not sure how that relates to testimony.\n\nAlternatively, the Testimony 4 says the defendant fled after tossing the pistol. Evidence 14 says the pistol was left at the scene. So that's consistent. The wiped prints might be because he wiped them, but the testimony doesn't say that. But the contradiction between Testimony 0 and Evidence 5 is stronger.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair is Evidence 5 and Testimony 0.\n</think>\n"

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let me start by going through each piece of evidence and testimony carefully.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies from Wesley Stickler. He mentions a few key points:\n\n- Testimony 0: He was at the supermarket that night.\n- Testimony 1: He dropped his cell phone on his way back from the supermarket.\n- Testimony 2: He witnessed the crime while walking through the park.\n- Testimony 4: The sign on the stand said \"NOODLE\".\n- Testimony 5: He saw the defendant at the scene.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences, particularly Evidence 5 (Cell Phone): It says the cell phone was found in the Meraktis Clinic garage beneath a car and is property of Wesley Stickler. \n\nThe contradiction here is between Testimony 1 and Evidence 5. Stickler claims he dropped his phone on his way back from the supermarket, which would logically be near the supermarket or along his path home. However, the evidence shows his phone was found in the Meraktis Clinic garage. If he was at the supermarket and then the park (as per Testimony 2), the clinic's garage isn't on that path. This suggests he might have been at the clinic, contradicting his alibi of being at the supermarket and park.\n\nAnother possible contradiction is Testimony 4 where he says the sign read \"NOODLE\", but Evidence 12 (Noodle Stand) has a sign that says \"ELDOON\". That's a direct discrepancy in the name of the stand. Testimony 4 says \"NOODLE\" but the evidence shows \"ELDOON\". That's a clear contradiction.\n\nWait, the user mentioned to pick only one pair. Let me confirm:\n\nTestimony 4: \"It said 'NOODLE'!\" vs Evidence 12's caption stating the sign reads \"ELDOON\". That's a direct contradiction. So the evidence number for the Noodle Stand is 12, and the testimony is 4. \n\nAlternatively, the cell phone location is another contradiction, but the sign's name is more straightforward. Let me check the evidence numbers again. Evidence 12's description says the sign reads \"ELDOON\". So Testimony 4 says \"NOODLE\", which is different. \n\nYes, that's a clear contradiction. So the answer would be evidence 12 and testimony 4.\n</think>\n"

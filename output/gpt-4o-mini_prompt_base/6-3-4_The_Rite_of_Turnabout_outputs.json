However, Tahrust's autopsy report indicates that the cause of death was blood loss from an abdominal wound, suggesting he was killed in a manner consistent with a physical attack. But if Maya channeled Lady Kee'ra, the implication here is that she could not have physically harmed Tahrust, as she is a medium and cannot interact physically in that manner. Therefore, the testimony contradicts the understanding of how channeling works.\n",

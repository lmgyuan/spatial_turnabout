Testimony 4 states, "I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes." However, Evidence 11, which is "Mr. Monkey's Head," indicates that the path to the scene of the crime was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, suggesting that Cody wouldn't have been able to stay lost for that long without being caught. This implies a contradiction in Cody's testimony regarding his journey to the studio.

******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 3 states, "But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it." However, Evidence 5, which is "Powers'(?) Photo," indicates that a photo was taken at 2:00 PM, just before the time of death at 2:30 PM. This means that if a photo was captured at the time mentioned, Cody claiming to have missed it contradicts the existence of that photograph.

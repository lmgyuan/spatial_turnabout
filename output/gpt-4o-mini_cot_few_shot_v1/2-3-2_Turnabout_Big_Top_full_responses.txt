Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimonies given by Trilo (Testimony 2 and Testimony 4) state that Trilo had an engagement ring for Regina in his pocket. However, Evidence 10, which is the "Ring," indicates a cheap ring with the engraving "From T to R." This suggests that the supposed engagement ring Trilo intended to give was not the one found, leading to a contradiction about the legitimacy of the "engagement" based on a distinction between the rings.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 0 states, "I was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max." However, Evidence 2, which is "Crime Photo," shows the victim lying on a case in the snow with the victim's footprints leading to where he is. If the witness was far away, they wouldn't be able to identify Max specifically from a shadow alone with such clarity, contradicting the precise identification that Moe claims.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 0 states, "There were no white roses that night!" However, Evidence 4, which is "Max G. Promo Poster," indicates that the three famous symbols of Max are a silk hat, cloak, and white roses, suggesting that white roses should have been present. This contradiction means that Moe's testimony cannot be true.

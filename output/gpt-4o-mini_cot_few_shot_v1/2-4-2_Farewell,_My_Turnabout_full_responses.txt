Testimony 5 states, "The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!" However, Evidence 15, which is "Knife," states that it "bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints," indicating that it was found at the crime scene but doesn't directly support the claim of it being bought specifically for the crime or premeditated murder. Thus, there is a contradiction regarding the implication of premeditation based on the evidence.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 4 states, "It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!" However, Evidence 14, which is "Juan's Autopsy Report," states that Juan was "strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife" at 8:15 PM, which raises questions about the timeline and possibility of Engarde being seen sneaking out after the murder has occurred.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 4 states, "So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan." However, Evidence 14, which is "Juan's Autopsy Report," states that the cause of death was "strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife," implying that the murder happened without any mention of the costume. This creates a contradiction regarding the details of the murder.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 4 states, "I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice." However, Evidence 8, which is "Wine Glass," states that the glass found next to the victim is filled with tomato juice and bears Andrews' fingerprints, but there is no mention of her pouring herself a glass or drinking from the wine glass. This suggests a contradiction regarding her claim about the juice.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.  

Testimony 1 states, "I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over." However, Evidence 7 indicates that the guitar case is "empty," suggesting that if she opened it after knocking over the vase, there would have been no items to concern her. This creates a contradiction regarding her actions relative to the timing of the vase and the case being empty.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 5 states, "That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt." However, Evidence 16 indicates that the "Jammin' Ninja's Button" is covered in Corrida's blood and was found in Engarde's "hakama." This suggests that the button either did not come from Juan during a fight or that it was planted, contradicting Andrews' claim that it was definitely from a fight.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 0 states, "That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself." However, Evidence 8, which is "Wine Glass," states that "bears Andrews' fingerprints." This suggests that Andrews did pour the juice, contradicting her testimony.

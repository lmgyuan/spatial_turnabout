Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 0 states that "La mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves." However, Evidence 12 describes the scene as having "Two dining tables separated by a folding screen," which contradicts the idea that a mirror was dividing the space in the restaurant. Thus, the testimony and evidence are inconsistent.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 2 states that the old man arrived just after 2 PM, but based on Glen's Autopsy Report, the time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. If he arrived just after 2 PM, it would imply that he could not have been poisoned prior to his arrival and contradicts the timeline of his death.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 1 states, "I was tied up with business in December last year. Spent all'a my time in my office." However, Evidence 10, which is "Glen's Autopsy Report," shows that Glen Elg died on December 3rd, implying that Tigre could not have spent all his time in his office, as the murder occurred during that time.

Testimony 0 states, "I ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg." However, Evidence 10, which is "Glen's Autopsy Report," and the surrounding context indicate that Glen Elg was poisoned and had connections with Tender Lender. This raises doubts about Tigre's assertion that he never met the victim, implying inconsistency in his testimony regarding their relationship.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 2 states, "The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete." However, Evidence 10, which is "Glen's Autopsy Report," states that Glen died of potassium cyanide poisoning, with a time of death estimated between 1:30 and 2:30 PM, suggesting that he was not simply "laid out" dead prior to this time. 

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 2}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 7 states, "I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!" However, Evidence 10, specifically "Glen's Autopsy Report," states that Glen died from potassium cyanide poisoning, indicating the need for a motive to administer the poison, which contradicts Tigre's claim that he had no reason to kill Glen. Thus, there is a contradiction between Tigre's claim of having no reason to kill and the evidence of poisoning suggesting deliberate intent.

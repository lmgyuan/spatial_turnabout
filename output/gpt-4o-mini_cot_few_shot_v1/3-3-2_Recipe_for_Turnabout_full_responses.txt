Testimony 4 states, "When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison." However, Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide) states that "it bears Maggey's fingerprints." This implies that the poison is connected to Maggey but does not clarify the circumstances of its presence. The testimony suggests it was straightforwardly found during the search, while the context around the poison's presence is more ambiguous. However, a clearer contradiction arises within the timeline presented.

Testimony 0 states, "The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir." Meanwhile, Evidence 10, "Glen's Autopsy Report," states that the time of death was between 1:30 PM and 2:30 PM, meaning if the crime was reported after 2:25 PM, this could imply a discrepancy in timing regarding how the police were notified compared to the time of death.

To be precise, the testimony does not stipulate when the murder itself occurred, but that the crime was reported, which implies that the victim may have already been dead prior. Nonetheless, since we can ascertain this time discrepancy of the report and the death, they contradict in their relevance to how the events unfold.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 1 states, "The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!" However, Evidence 13, which is "Coffee Cup," describes that the coffee contained potassium cyanide and was “covered in the victim and Maggey's fingerprints.” This implies that the serving girl, Maggey, could not have put something in the coffee after it was made, creating a contradiction in the account given by Kudo.

Testimony 4 states, "The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip." However, Evidence 13, which is "Coffee Cup," indicates that the coffee cup is covered in both the victim and Maggey's fingerprints, suggesting Maggey interacted with it, not the young man mentioned in Testimony 4. This implies a contradiction between the testimony and the evidence regarding who handled the cup.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 1 states, "The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino..." However, Evidence 10, which is "Glen's Autopsy Report," indicates that Glen died of potassium cyanide poisoning, which does not make a specific mention of a javaccino being involved in his death. This creates a contradiction regarding the circumstances of his death as presented in the testimony.

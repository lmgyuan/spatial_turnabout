Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a list of evidence and testimonies related to a case, and I need to identify a pair that contradicts each other. The final answer should be in JSON format, indicating which evidence and testimony contradict each other.

First, I'll list out the evidence and testimonies to get a clear picture.

**Evidence:**
0. Attorney's Badge
1. Cell Phone
2. Dustin's Autopsy Report
3. Glasses
4. Crime Photo 1
5. Crime Photo 2
6. Baseball Glove
7. Phoenix's Business Card
8. Names List
9. Judge's Business Card

**Testimonies:**
0. Gumshoe mentions something more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body.
1. Gumshoe states the victim was pushed from the bench area during his date.
2. Gumshoe notes that the victim wrote the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.
3. Gumshoe claims the name written was "Maggie," the defendant's name.
4. Gumshoe concludes that with the glasses and the name, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.

Now, I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other.

Looking at the evidence, item 3 is "Glasses" found under the victim's body. Testimony 0 mentions that there's something more incriminating than the glasses. Testimony 3 points out that the victim wrote "Maggie" on the ground, which directly implicates the defendant.

The contradiction arises because the glasses (evidence 3) being under the body suggest they might belong to the perpetrator, but testimony 3 introduces the name "Maggie" as written by the victim, which directly accuses her. If the glasses are more incriminating, as testimony 0 suggests, but testimony 3 provides a different piece of evidence (the name), there's a contradiction between the emphasis on the glasses and the introduction of the written name as evidence.

Therefore, evidence 3 (Glasses) contradicts testimony 3, where Gumshoe claims the victim wrote "Maggie."

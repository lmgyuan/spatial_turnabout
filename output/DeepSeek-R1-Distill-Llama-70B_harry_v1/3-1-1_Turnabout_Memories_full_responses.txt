Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a list of evidence and testimonies related to a case, and I need to find a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. The final answer should be in JSON format, like {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}.

First, I'll go through the evidence and testimonies one by one to understand what each is saying.

**Evidence:**
- **Evidence 0:** Attorney's Badge - It's the attorney's badge, proof of profession, first and last used a year ago.
- **Evidence 1:** Doug's Autopsy Report - Died on 4/9 at 3 PM due to electric shock.
- **Evidence 2:** Crime Photo 1 - Crime scene behind Ivy U. building, victim lying head down, wearing a plain shirt, broken power cable with sparks, open umbrella with bent handle nearby.
- **Evidence 3:** Crime Photo 2 - Victim's hand holding a Coldkiller X bottle, watch stopped at 3:05.
- **Evidence 4:** Coldkiller X - Found in victim's hand, has Wright's fingerprints.
- **Evidence 5:** Umbrella - Victim's, broken near electrical pole at crime scene.
- **Evidence 6:** Phoenix's Testimony - Victim fell on umbrella, loud sound when it happened.
- **Evidence 7:** Dahlia's Present - Necklace given to Wright, he shows it to everyone.
- **Evidence 8:** Newspaper Clipping - Article from 8/28, 8 months prior.
- **Evidence 9:** Student's Testimony - Power cable broke due to impact at 2:55 PM on 4/9.
- **Evidence 10:** Police Report - Details of an incident on August 27, 4:00 PM, involving Diego Armando and Dahlia Hawthorne, where Armando ingested poison.

**Testimonies:**
- **Testimony 0:** Phoenix admits being at the scene.
- **Testimony 1:** Claims he's not a killer, just found the body.
- **Testimony 2:** Says he hardly knew the victim.
- **Testimony 3:** Claims he never talked to the victim, describes him as a "stuck-up British wannabe."
- **Testimony 4:** Mentions the victim always had a Union Jack on his shirt.

Now, I need to find a contradiction between any evidence and testimony.

Looking at **Testimony 3** and **Testimony 4**, Phoenix claims he never talked to the victim and describes him in a certain way. But **Evidence 7** is a present from Dahlia to Wright, which Wright shows off, indicating some level of interaction or acquaintance. This could contradict his claim of not knowing the victim well.

Additionally, **Testimony 0** and **Testimony 1** could be contradicted by **Evidence 4**, which shows Wright's fingerprints on the Coldkiller X, suggesting he handled it, which might imply more involvement than just finding the body.

But the most direct contradiction seems to be between **Testimony 3** (claiming no interaction) and **Evidence 7** (having a present from Dahlia, indicating some relationship).

So, the pair would be {"evidence": 7, "testimony": 3}.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 3}
{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 2}
{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 1}
{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 4}
{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 4}

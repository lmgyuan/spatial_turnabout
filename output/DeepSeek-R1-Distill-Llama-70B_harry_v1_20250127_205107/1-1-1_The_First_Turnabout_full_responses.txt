Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I have a list of evidence and testimonies, so I'll go through each one step by step.

First, looking at the evidence. Evidence 0 is an Attorney's Badge, which doesn't seem relevant here. Evidence 1 is Cindy's Autopsy Report, stating she died between 4PM and 5PM on 7/31 due to blood loss from blunt trauma. Evidence 2 is a statue called "The Thinker" which is heavy. Evidence 3 is a passport showing the victim arrived home on 7/30. Evidence 4 is a blackout record, saying the electricity was out from noon to 6 PM on the crime day.

Now the testimonies are all from Sahwit. Testimony 0 says Sahwit saw a man fleeing an apartment. Testimony 1 mentions the man left the door half-open. Testimony 2 says Sahwit looked inside and saw the victim. Testimony 3 is about seeing the woman dead. Testimony 4 is Sahwit being too scared to go in. Testimony 5 is thinking to call the police. Testimony 6 says the phone wasn't working. Testimony 7 is going to a park to find a public phone. Testimony 8 says it was exactly 1:00 PM. Testimony 9 identifies the defendant as the man who ran.

Wait, the autopsy says time of death is between 4PM-5PM, but Sahwit's testimony 8 says he called the police at 1:00 PM. That doesn't add up because if the murder happened around 4-5 PM, Sahwit couldn't have seen the body at 1 PM. So the contradiction is between the autopsy report (Evidence 1) and Sahwit's testimony about the time (Testimony 8). But the user asked for one pair, so maybe I should pick another.

Alternatively, the blackout record (Evidence 4) says electricity was out from noon to 6 PM. If the phone wasn't working (Testimony 6), that could be because of the blackout. But Sahwit went to a public phone at 1 PM, which is during the blackout. Wait, the blackout was until 6 PM, so the phone in the apartment wouldn't work, but the public phone might still work. So maybe that's not a contradiction.

Wait, another point: the statue (Evidence 2) is heavy, which could be the murder weapon, but the autopsy says blunt trauma, which matches a heavy object. So that supports each other, not contradict.

The passport (Evidence 3) shows the victim arrived on 7/30, so she was home on 7/31, which fits with the murder happening that day.

So the main contradiction is between the autopsy time (4-5 PM) and Sahwit's testimony of calling at 1 PM. So Evidence 1 and Testimony 8 contradict each other.

But the user's example had {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}, so maybe I need to find another pair. Wait, the statue is heavy, but in Testimony 3, Sahwit saw the victim dead. Maybe the time is the key.

Alternatively, if the blackout was until 6 PM, and Sahwit called at 1 PM, but the phone was out, but he used a public phone, so that's possible. So maybe that's not a contradiction.

Wait, the autopsy says time of death is 4-5 PM, but Sahwit's testimony 8 says he called at 1 PM, which is before the murder. So that's a contradiction because the murder hadn't happened yet when he called. So the evidence (autopsy) and testimony (time of call) contradict each other.

So the pair is Evidence 1 and Testimony 8.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts one of the testimonies in this case. Let's see, I have a list of evidences and testimonies from Sahwit. I need to find one pair where something doesn't add up.

First, I'll go through the evidences. There's the Attorney's Badge, Cindy's Autopsy Report, a Statue, a Passport, and a Blackout Record. The Blackout Record says the electricity was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime. That seems important because if the power was out, things like TVs wouldn't be working.

Now, looking at Sahwit's testimonies. He mentions hearing a voice saying the time, probably from the television, but then he says it was three hours off. He thought the victim was watching a taped program, which is why he believed it was 1:00 PM. But wait, the Blackout Record says the electricity was out until 6 PM. If the power was out, the TV wouldn't have been working at all, right? So Sahwit saying he heard the time from the TV doesn't make sense because the TV wouldn't have been on during the blackout.

That seems like a clear contradiction. Sahwit's testimony about hearing the time from the TV (Testimony 1) contradicts the Blackout Record (Evidence 4) because the TV wouldn't have been operational during the blackout.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. I've got a list of evidence and testimonies, and I need to find which one contradicts the other. 

First, looking at the evidence. There's the Attorney's Badge, which doesn't seem relevant here. Then there's Cindy's Autopsy Report, which says she died between 4 PM and 5 PM on July 31st due to blood loss from blunt trauma. The Statue is described as heavy, maybe a potential weapon. The Passport shows she came back from Paris the day before the murder, and the Blackout Record says the electricity was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime.

Now, the testimonies. Sahwit says he saw a man fleeing the apartment, thought he was in a hurry because the door was half-open, looked inside, saw her dead, got scared, wanted to call the police but the phone wasn't working, went to a park and called at exactly 1 PM, and the man was the defendant.

Wait, the autopsy says she died between 4 and 5 PM, but Sahwit called the police at 1 PM. That seems off. If she died later, how did Sahwit see her dead at 1 PM? Unless the time he saw her was after she died, but the autopsy says she died later. That doesn't make sense. So maybe Sahwit's testimony about the time contradicts the autopsy report.

Also, the Blackout Record says the electricity was out until 6 PM. If Sahwit saw the body at 1 PM, the electricity was still out. But if the autopsy says she died later, maybe the body wasn't there yet when Sahwit saw it. That could mean Sahwit's testimony about seeing her dead at 1 PM is wrong because she was still alive then.

So, putting it together, the autopsy (evidence 1) says she died between 4-5 PM, but Sahwit (testimony 8) said he saw her dead at 1 PM. That's a contradiction because she couldn't have been dead at 1 PM if she died later.

I think that's the pair that contradicts each other.

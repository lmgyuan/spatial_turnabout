Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a list of evidence and testimonies related to a case, and I need to identify a pair that contradicts each other. The final answer should be in JSON format, indicating which evidence and testimony contradict each other.

First, I'll list out the evidence and testimonies provided to get a clear picture.

**Evidence:**
0. Attorney's Badge
1. Maya's Magatama
2. Crime Photo
3. Silk Hat
4. Max G. Promo Poster
5. Ringmaster's Papers
6. Circus Map
7. Broken Bottle
8. Trilo Quist
9. Money the Monkey
10. Ring
11. Russell's Autopsy Report
12. Wooden Box
13. Small Seasoning Bottle
14. Grand Prix Photo
15. Max G. Bust
16. Note
17. Stage Costume
18. LÃ©on
19. Scarf

**Testimonies:**
0. Don't be so surprised that I was going to propose to Regina!
1. I even had something to give to her...
2. I planned on giving an engagement ring to Regina...
3. I kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her.
4. Of course, I also had it in my pocket that night. It was a present for her.
5. In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!
Person: Trilo

Now, I'll analyze each testimony and see how it relates to the evidence.

Trilo's testimonies all revolve around his intention to propose to Regina with an engagement ring that he kept in his pocket. He mentions that he had the ring in his pocket that night but didn't give it to her, so he still has it.

Looking at the evidence, I need to find something that contradicts this. The key here is to find evidence that shows the ring wasn't in Trilo's pocket or that contradicts the presence of the ring as he described.

Evidence 10 is a ring with an engraving "From T to R," which likely stands for Trilo to Regina. This ring was found, so it's physical evidence of the ring's existence. However, Trilo claims he had the ring in his pocket all along and still has it. If the ring was found elsewhere, this would contradict his testimony.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between Trilo's testimony about keeping the ring in his pocket and the evidence of the ring being found (Evidence 10).

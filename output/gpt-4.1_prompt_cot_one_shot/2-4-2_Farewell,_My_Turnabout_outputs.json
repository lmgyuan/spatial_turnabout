Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nPerson: Oldbag\nTestimony 1\nTestimony: The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nPerson: Oldbag\nTestimony 2\nTestimony: Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nPerson: Oldbag\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nPerson: Oldbag\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPerson: Oldbag\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies to find a contradiction.\n\nTestimony 4 (Oldbag) claims: \"So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\"\nHowever, according to Evidence 14 (Juan's Autopsy Report): \"Time of death: 8:15 PM. Cause: Strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife.\"\nThis means the cause of death was actually strangulation, the stabbing happened *after* the victim was already dead, making the premise of Oldbag's testimony misleading.\n\nBut the more direct contradiction comes from Testimony 1, where Oldbag says she saw the Nickel Samurai (implying Engarde) leave the scene right after the murder (Lotta's Photo also shows someone in samurai garb outside the room). However, Evidence 16 (Jammin' Ninja's Button) was found in Engarde's \"hakama\" (costume), and it is covered in Corrida's blood—implying the samurai suit should be bloodstained. But Lotta's Photo would have shown blood if the person was fleeing right after the murder with the murder costume. More significantly, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) shows the victim in a samurai outfit in the room. If Engarde was wearing the Nickel Samurai outfit during the murder, why does Corrida still appear dressed in a samurai costume after death? Further, the Nickel Samurai's costume was found in Engarde's room, not the victim's.\n\nBut let's look for a more formal, clear contradiction:\n\nTestimony 4: \"So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\"\nBut, Evidence 14 (Juan's Autopsy Report) says: \"Time of death: 8:15 PM. Cause: Strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife.\"\n\nThe contradiction: Oldbag says Corrida was stabbed to death, but the autopsy shows Corrida was strangled first, the stabbing happening after death (so the stabbing wasn't the cause, and the costume likely wouldn't be stained as described).\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 14 and Testimony 4.\n",

Empty. There is some water, but only on top of the lid.\" Evidence 9 also notes: \"An open guitar case lies on the floor next to him. Next to the guitar case are the remains of a smashed vase that has stained the carpet with water.\" The water is only on top of the lid, suggesting the case was closed when the vase was knocked over—even though it's open in the crime scene, implying Andrews' memory is inconsistent with the physical evidence.\n\nSo, the contradiction is:\n\n- Andrews says she opened the guitar case after knocking over the vase.\n- The evidence indicates the case was closed when the vase fell, as only the outside of the case has water.\n",

    "cot": "Let's consider Testimony 5: \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\" (said by Andrews). If the button was torn off during a fight between Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde, that would suggest Juan was alive and physically struggling with Matt at the time the button came off.\nHowever, Evidence 14 (Juan's Autopsy Report) says: \"Time of death: 8:15 PM. Cause: Strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife.\"\nIf Juan Corrida had already been strangled to death before being stabbed, he would be dead at the time of stabbing, suggesting there could not have been a physical fight in which a button could be forcefully torn off between him and Matt Engarde at that time.\nTherefore, Testimony 5 (button torn in a fight during the murder) contradicts Evidence 14 (victim was already dead before being stabbed).\n",

The victim sits on a chair in a samurai outfit. There is a knife sticking out of his chest. A glass of juice sits behind him on the dresser. A full bottle of juice sits on the desk in front of him. An open guitar case lies on the floor next to him. Next to the guitar case are the remains of a smashed vase that has stained the carpet with water.\"\n\nIf Andrews had poured the juice for him after seeing him slumped (thinking he fainted), but the glass is found untouched and behind him on the dresser (not placed where he could have reached for it), her testimony that she poured the juice for him when she thought he had fainted is inconsistent with the evidence suggesting it was never meant for Corrida to drink, or at least was not accessible to him, and not drank at all.\n\nBut further, Testimony 5 states, \"When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\" However, Evidence 9 shows that the water from the smashed vase stained the carpet near the guitar case on the floor, suggesting the vase was knocked over after the murder. If Andrews had knocked over the vase after realizing he was dead (after approaching Corrida), it is questionable why the water stain is over by the guitar case on the ground, a spot she wouldn't have been near based on her claimed sequence of actions.\n\nBut the most direct contradiction is between Testimony 4 (\"So I went to pour him some juice.\") and Evidence 8, which says the glass still had no sign it was ever drank, and it was found on the dresser, not in Juan's reach (according to the crime photo). If the glass was poured for Juan after he fainted, it should not be left untouched and out of reach, and she wouldn't have left it behind him.\n\nTherefore, the pair is:",

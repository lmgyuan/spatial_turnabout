It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\nPerson: Lang\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "Let's analyze the provided evidence and testimonies. \n\nTestimony 0 says, \"When the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot.\" This suggests Shaun was already on the film lot at the time of the incident.\n\nEvidence 12 (\"Shaun's Rehearsal Tape\") is described as \"Filmed yesterday evening. Shows Shaun rehearsing by a monster footprint.\" If Shaun was rehearsing by a monster footprint at the film lot yesterday evening, it means the monster footprints already existed.\n\nHowever, Evidence 9 (\"Behind-the-Scenes Photo\") states: \"Photo taken yesterday. No monster footprints and no body were visible at that point.\" This suggests that, at the time the photo was taken (yesterday), the monster footprints were not present at the scene.\n\nIf Shaun's rehearsal tape (Evidence 12) shows him at the monster footprint yesterday evening, but the photo taken yesterday (Evidence 9) shows no monster footprints at that time, then Shaun couldn't have been waiting at the film lot by the monster footprints when the president was pushed off the roof (assuming the incident happened before the footprints were created). This contradiction revolves largely around when the footprints appeared and where Shaun really was.\n\nHowever, a clearer contradiction lies between Evidence 5 (\"Crime Scene Notes\") and Testimony 2 (\"The two of them then hid the president's body.\"). Evidence 5 notes, \"The body lying face-up on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body.\" If the body was recently hidden under dirt (per Testimony 2), then dirt should be on both sides, especially the front. The absence of dirt on the front directly contradicts the claim that the body was recently hidden.\n\nSo, the contradiction is:\nEvidence 5 (\"The body lying face-up on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body.\") and Testimony 2 (\"The two of them then hid the president's body.\").\n",

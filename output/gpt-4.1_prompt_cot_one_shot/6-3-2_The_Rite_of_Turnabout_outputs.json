    "cot": "Let's analyze the statements.\n\nTestimony 0 states that Ihmus was \"at the top of Mt. Poniponi, the mountain next to the Inner Sanctum\" and Testimony 3 claims that from there, he \"used my binoculars to spy on the rite at the Inner Sanctum.\" Testimony 4 states, \"That's when I saw the accused... stab the high priest with a dagger!\"\n\nNow, looking at the evidence, specifically Evidence 11, \"Mountain Range Poster,\" it says: \"A poster and a photograph of the entire Inner Sanctum and Mt. Poniponi area. Mt. Poniponi is 2298 meters tall and to the west. The Inner Sanctum is 2310 meters tall and to the east.\" The Inner Sanctum is a different peak, higher than Mt. Poniponi, and the Inner Sanctum is surrounded by a \"Ritual Curtain\" (Evidence 4), which is described as a curtain around the perimeter of the sanctum, isolating it from the outside world. The entrance was shut during the rite.\n\nIf the Inner Sanctum is surrounded by a curtain, the view inside would have been obstructed. Thus, it directly contradicts Ihmus's testimony that he saw the stabbing take place with binoculars from a mountain next door.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 4 (Ritual Curtain) and Testimony 4 (Ihmus claims to see the stabbing from Mt. Poniponi) contradict each other.\n",

    "cot": "Let's examine the relevant evidence and testimonies.\n\nTestimony 1 states: \"The figures were created by the light of the full moon on that clear and still night.\" This means the witness claims the silhouettes on the ritual curtain were created by moonlight.\n\nHowever, according to Evidence 2 (May 9th Newspaper), \"The area around the Inner Sanctum will enjoy calm, clear skies today. The warmer temperature will make for excellent prayer weather. Be warned, however, that we will see a cold front move in overnight.\" The important point here is that the Purification Rite begins when the moon is directly over the summit of Mt. Poniponi (see Evidence 1: Rites Guide), so the moon should be over the sky at the time of the rite. But if you examine Evidence 7 (Inner Sanctum Photo) and Evidence 4 (Ritual Curtain: entrance shut during the rite), you realize that the only light sources are lanterns inside, as the curtain \"isolates it from the outside world\" (Evidence 4). This means moonlight should not be able to project silhouettes on the curtain from inside the sanctum, contradicting the assertion that the shadows were made by moonlight outside.\n\nBut let's focus on the strongest contradiction. Evidence 4 specifically says: \"A curtain around the perimeter of the sanctum, isolating it from the outside world. The entrance was shut during the rite.\" If the curtain is fully enclosing the sanctum, no external light—such as moonlight—can project onto it. So, Testimony 1 is contradicted by Evidence 4.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies.\n\nTestimony 3 claims: \"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!\" This testimony suggests that access to the Inner Sanctum was impossible via the cliffs. However, Evidence 2 (\"May 9th Newspaper\") states: \"The thick, white ice that froze the ground from the Inner Sanctum to the Plaza of Devotion until yesterday has melted. The rite can now go on as planned.\"\n\nIf the ice that originally covered the area between the Inner Sanctum and the Plaza has melted, that means travel was possible at the time in question. This contradicts the testimony that nobody could have climbed up due to impassable cliffs. Thus, the claim of impossibility is undercut by the evidence of newly possible access once the ice melted.\n",

It reads: The Purification Rite is a three-part ceremony held when the moon is directly over the summit of Mt. Poniponi. It begins with the Transformation Rite. The high priest reads scripture dons the robes of Lady Kee'ra, which have been purified with incense. Next is the Rite of Water, in which the priestess enters the spring dressed as Lady Kee'ra, and the high priest purifies both Lady Kee'ra and her dagger. The ceremony ends with the Rite of Fire, in which the priestess circles the sacred flames to purify her soul. The two then devote themselves to prayer until the rite comes to a close two days later at noontime.\nEvidence 2\nName: May 9th Newspaper\nDescription: A newspaper from the morning of the Purification Rite. It reports on the weather and Lady Kee'ra's activities, among other things. [caption] It reads: - Lady Kee'ra Returns to Battle Rebels - The Lady Kee'ra-like figure that appeared two years ago remains a mystery. Some town elders see her as Lady Kee'ra in the flesh. Such rumors are fueling the enthusiasm for today's Purification Rite. - Today's Purification Rite - The thick, white ice that froze the ground from the Inner Sanctum to the Plaza of Devotion until yesterday has melted. The rite can now go on as planned. We give thanks for the blessings of the Holy Mother and Lady Kee'ra. Hap'piraki! - Escaped Prisoner Alert! - Police are asking the kingdom's subjects to be on the lookout for a male insurgent who escaped from Royal Penitentiary No. 4 yesterday. - Weather Forecast - The area around the Inner Sanctum will enjoy calm, clear skies today. The warmer temperature will make for excellent prayer weather.

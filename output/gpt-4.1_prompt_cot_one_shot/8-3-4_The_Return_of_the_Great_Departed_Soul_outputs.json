    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and the testimonies for a contradiction.\n\nTestimony 2 by Tusspells says: \"I enlisted the aid of the gravedigger, and created a mould for the head in the cemetery just before the interment.\" This describes the act of taking an impression of the deceased's face *before* the body was buried.\n\nHowever, Evidence 16, \"Killer's Autopsy Report,\" says the 'Professor' was hanged and his death was confirmed at midnight, 17th June, presided over by coroner Courtney Stevens. The implication is that the Professor was executed and there was no opportunity for access to the body after midnight, as official procedures for executed criminals in this era would have required the body to be kept under strict supervision (or even disposed of immediately to prevent 'relic' hunters and rumors of resurrection).\n\nSince Testimony 2 asserts a clandestine gravedigging and moulding, but Evidence 16 documents a controlled, official execution and confirmation of death, the two directly contradict each other on whether Tusspells could have had access to the body for a death mask.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the relevant evidence and testimonies.\n\nTestimony 3 from Sithe states: \"The actual cause of death was the neck trauma Asman suffered from the thirty-foot fall.\" This is saying the fall killed Asman, not anything else.\n\nHowever, Evidence 6 (Autopsy Report) says: \"The autopsy report of the victim, Mr Asman. His neck was broken from the impact of a violent fall and he was stabbed in the chest with a sharp object.\"\n\nWhile it mentions both the neck trauma (which supports the testimony), Evidence 5 (Photograph of the Victim) states: \"A photographic print of the victim taken after he had ostensibly been 'beamed' to the Crystal Tower. It shows an apparent stab wound to the chest.\" Additionally, Evidence 7 (Screwdriver) says it matches the shape of the wound and has blood on the tip.\n\nBut importantly, Testimony 4 states: \"I stood over the victim's corpse where it lay in the toppled cage and plunged the screwdriver into the chest.\" This implies the stab happened *after* death.\n\nTherefore, the main contradiction emerges between:\n- Testimony 3: Cause of death was neck trauma from the fall.\n- Evidence 6: Autopsy Report clarifies both neck trauma AND stabbing, but in the investigation context, generally the autopsy would be able to determine whether the stab occurred before or after death.\n\nHowever, the most direct contradiction is between Testimony 4 (that Sithe stabbed a corpse -- that is, after death) and Evidence 6 (Autopsy Report), which states the victim was stabbed in the chest, potentially indicating it was a fatal wound or occurred while the victim was alive (as autopsies can show pre- and post-mortem wounds).\n\nGiven you asked for *one* pair only and for the best contradiction, the fact that Sithe claims to stab the corpse after death and the autopsy listing stabbing as a cause of death is contradictory.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies:\nTestimony 5 by Bikini states, \"And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!\", which strongly suggests Bikini claims to have seen the victim being stabbed *while she awoke*. However, Evidence 9, \"Victim's Staff,\" indicates that the actual murder weapon was the staff (with a hidden sword inside), not the Shichishito. The key contradiction is with the testimony that emphasizes seeing the stabbing at her moment of awakening (implying she witnessed the murder weapon in use), whereas the staff had its crystal sphere missing (as per Evidence 16) and the Shichishito was found at the scene with blood, but is NOT the true murder weapon (Evidence 10). More specifically, Testimony 2 states: \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out\", which directly refers to seeing the sword (Shichishito) being pulled out—and this contradicts Evidence 10, which establishes the Shichishito as NOT being the murder weapon.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 2 (Bikini claiming to see the murder weapon being withdrawn) is contradicted by Evidence 10, which states the Shichishito is not the murder weapon.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies.\n\nTestimony 2 from Butz claims that he \"saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\"\n\nHowever, Evidence 6 (\"Iris's Hood\") specifies that Iris gave her hood to Phoenix before the lights out bell at 10 PM and did not have it afterwards. The incident of seeing \"Iris flying with her white hood\" would have happened after this time, meaning Iris could not have been wearing her hood, contradicting Butz's testimony.\n",

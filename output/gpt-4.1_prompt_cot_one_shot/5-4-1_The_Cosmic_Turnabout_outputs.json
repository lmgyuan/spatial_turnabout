I was trying to save him!\nPerson: Starbuck\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "Let's look for any testimony that contradicts the evidence.\n\nEvidence 1, \"Terran's Autopsy Report,\" says Clay Terran died from a stabbing.\n\nEvidence 3 is a knife with the victim's blood on it, implying it is the murder weapon. There's no contradiction here with the testimonies yet.\n\nEvidence 8, \"Oxygen Tank Data,\" says the victim's (Clay's) oxygen tank was ruptured by a bullet, and it had 0% oxygen left. This means after being stabbed, Clay's oxygen tank was also shot.\n\nNow, let's check the related testimonies:\n\nTestimony 0: Starbuck says, \"All I did was support Clay over my shoulder and get us out of the rocket!\"\nTestimony 1: \"Like always, I took the elevator down to the middle level and headed for the corridor.\"\nTestimony 2: \"Clay had passed out by the time we got the order to evacuate.\"\nTestimony 3: \"I didn't kill Clay! I was trying to save him!\"\n\nLooking closer, there are two bullets as evidence:\n\nEvidence 10: Bulletin hole in the lounge, from a .38 caliber gun.\nEvidence 12: Bullet from a .10 caliber handgun.\nEvidence 15: Bullet from Arme's gun (.38 caliber) found near the oxygen tank.\n\nSo the oxygen tank was struck by a bullet from a .38 as per E15. That means there was a gunshot after Clay was stabbed.\n\nIf we take Testimony 0, Starbuck says he just carried Clay over his shoulder and escaped; this does not mention the shooting incident. But this is not a direct contradiction.\n\nLet us check Aura’s Statement (Evidence 14): \"The perp held a lighter with an Earth emblem on it in their left hand, and a knife in their right.\" This implies the killer used a knife in the right hand and lighter in the left.\n\nNow, Evidence 16 says the lighter was found with Athena's prints in the victim's blood, but this ties to the real killer and Athena being framed, not a direct contradiction to a testimony.\n\nLet us focus on the oxygen tank being shot. If Clay was stabbed and then shot in the oxygen tank, and Starbuck says all he did was support him and get out, but the Security Camera Video (Evidence 7) shows only the escape, and not the shooting.\n\nBut the key contradiction is between the cause of death (stabbing, per autopsy, Evidence 1) and the notion that the bullet (from the .38 in Evidence 15) but Testimony 3, Starbuck says, \"I didn't kill Clay! I was trying to save him!\" That isn’t a contradiction; he could have tried to save him.\n\nBut Evidence 8 says: \"The victim's tank was ruptured, with 0% left. The defendant's had 80%. Remaining oxygen is displayed on left shoulder. The victim's oxygen tank was struck by a bullet.\" That means Clay could not be alive for Starbuck to carry him for long—he would have suffocated almost instantly.\n\nBut Testimony 0 and 2 together say Starbuck carried Clay out because he had passed out—if Clay had been shot in the oxygen tank, he would have had 0% oxygen, which would cause death very quickly; support over shoulder for any period of time would be impossible.\n\nEvidence 8 and Testimony 0, then: Starbuck claims he carried Clay out of the rocket, but if the victim’s tank was shot and empty (Evidence 8), he would have died within moments, not long enough for Starbuck to support and carry him. That’s a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n",

Head injury sustained post mortem. Death occurred as a result of a heavy blow to the head with a circular object. Chest wounds inflicted post-mortem.\"\nThis suggests that the head injury (delivered by a \"circular object\") caused death, while the stab wounds were inflicted after death. Evidence 9 (Candelabrum) describes a three-armed candle holder designed to \"look like the murder weapon,\" not actually the weapon. The implication is that the initial murder weapon is different, and the scene was possibly staged—meaning Debeste's assertion that Kay is \"the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane\" is contradicted by the forensic facts in the autopsy report, which cast doubt on a direct, singular method or perpetrator.\n\nTherefore:",

However, Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) says the chest wounds (which might have been a way to \"retaliate\") were inflicted post-mortem, and that cause of death was a blow to the head. That means Ms. Crane could not have acted with her dying breath; she died from the head blow, and all chest wounds happened after she was already dead.

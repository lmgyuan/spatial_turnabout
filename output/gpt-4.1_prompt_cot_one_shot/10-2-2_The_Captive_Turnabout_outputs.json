Were they tampered with the night before the body was found?\n\nTestimonies:\nTestimony 0\nTestimony: I believe that the culprit in this case could only have been Kanis.\nPerson: Laguarde\nTestimony 1\nTestimony: I have no idea what transpired between Kanis and the victim.\nPerson: Laguarde\nTestimony 2\nTestimony: It simply could have been that Kanis was displeased with him.\nPerson: Laguarde\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: In any case, he was the one who stabbed the victim to death.\nPerson: Laguarde\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: Perhaps he used the chisel hidden in the chessboard?\nPerson: Laguarde\nTestimony 5\nTestimony: I'm sure it would have been a simple \"job\".\nPerson: Laguarde\nTestimony 6\nTestimony: He probably had a dog dispose of the body. This is the truth of the case.\nPerson: Laguarde\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "First, let's look for a testimony that states Kanis stabbed the victim with the chisel he had hidden. Testimony 4 claims, \"Perhaps he used the chisel hidden in the chessboard?\" (referring to Kanis). \n\nHowever, if we look at the evidence about the chisel, Evidence 21 states the chisel was hidden by Kanis inside his dog's mouth to avoid suspicion and it was Knight's property. But importantly, Evidence 12 (\"Prison Search\") states that Winner, Gavèlle and the warden searched the prison for the murder weapon but couldn't find anything—implying the murder weapon was not immediately discoverable, and perhaps not what Laguarde claimed. \n\nStill, there is a more direct contradiction: Testimony 3 is accusatory (\"In any case, he was the one who stabbed the victim to death,\" meaning Kanis stabbed the victim), but the security camera footage (Evidence 15) shows that the victim was attacked by a \"dark form\" in his holding cell, not necessarily identifying Kanis as the assailant. \n\nHowever, the most direct contradiction is between Testimony 6 (\"He probably had a dog dispose of the body. This is the truth of the case.\") and Evidence 19 (\"Tunnel Prints\"), which says the photo of the tunnel between the prison and the detention center shows paw prints made by a bear, not a dog.\n\nThus, the testimony that a dog disposed of the body is contradicted by the evidence that a bear's paw prints, and not a dog's, were found.\n",

    "cot": "Examining the evidence and testimonies, let's focus on Testimony 5: \"Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.\" This testimony is by Vasquez. Now, let's look at the Steak Plate (Evidence 16), which the description says: \"Found in the employee area. On it are traces of sleeping pills and a large bone. This is where Sal Manella and Dee Vasquez ate. There's nothing left on the plates.\" However, importantly, this evidence places the leftovers of the steak plate in the employee area, not \"in front of the trailer\" as Vasquez claims. This is contradictory—the testimony says the meal was eaten at the trailer, but the physical evidence shows the plate in the employee area.\n",

This contradicts Vasquez's implication that Powers was able to arrive after the police were called — which would be after the body was found and the path already blocked.\n",

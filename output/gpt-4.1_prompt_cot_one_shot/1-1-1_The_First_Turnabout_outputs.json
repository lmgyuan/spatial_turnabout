    "cot": "First, let's analyze the evidence and testimony for contradictions:\n\nLooking at Evidence 4, the Blackout Record, it says: \"Electricity to Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime.\"\n\nNow, examine Sahwit's testimonies:\n- Testimony 1: \"There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.\"\n- Testimony 0: \"You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.\"\n\nSahwit claims he \"heard the time\" from the television, but if the electricity was out from noon to 6 PM, the television couldn't have been on during the window when the murder occurred (4PM-5PM per the autopsy report). Therefore, his claim is contradicted by the blackout record.\n\nThe clearest contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Blackout Record) and Testimony 1 (the time came from the television).\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies:\n\nEvidence 4 states that electricity to Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime. Therefore, any testimony involving an electric table clock showing the time would be questionable, as the clock would not have functioned without power, unless it was battery-operated and we have no such evidence.\n\nTestimony 1 states that there was a table clock in the apartment, and the implication is that the clock was used to determine the time of the crime. However, with the electricity out, this clock could not have been displaying the correct time if it depended on electricity.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 4 and Testimony 1 contradict each other.\n",

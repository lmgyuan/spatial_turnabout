    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies for contradictions.\n\nTestimony 2 by Dahlia says, \"I had come to this courthouse to do some research for a paper I was writing.\"\n\nHowever, Evidence 10, the Police Report, states that on that day, August 27th, Dahlia was a suspect being interviewed regarding the Diego Armando poisoning case. This means she was in the courthouse because she was being questioned as a suspect, not because she was \"doing research for a paper.\" Her stated reason for being in the courthouse contradicts the official police report.\n",

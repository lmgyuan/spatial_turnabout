There is a bloodstain on the right glove.\"\n\nIf the defendant wore gloves at the time, blood could only get on the gloves, not on his hands. Therefore, Fairplay's statement about \"blood-soaked hands\" is contradicted by the fact that gloves would have concealed any blood and that the bloodstain is on the glove, not the hands.\n",

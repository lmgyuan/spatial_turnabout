I just wiped my hand on it, that's all.\" If he \"just wiped his hand on it,\" that could explain the presence of a handprint, but the handprint is *bloody*. Gossip doesn't mention anything about blood, which may be a slight contradiction, but it's plausible he omitted that detail.\n\nLet's review Testimony 5 by Sandwich: \"The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.\"\n\nNow, let's reference Evidence 11, which is \"Inspector Gregson's autopsy report, stating that death was instant, resulting from a bullet shot at close range. The autopsy report...an accurate estimation of the time of death is not possible.\"\n\nTestimony 5 claims the detective died \"when we heard the gunshot,\" but the autopsy report specifically states that \"an accurate estimation of the time of death is not possible.\" This means it cannot be definitively said that he died exactly when the gunshot was heard—it is entirely possible, given the ambiguity of the autopsy report, that the gunshot was not simultaneous with the death, or that the time the witnesses heard it is not the true time.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 5 (\"the detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot\") is contradicted by Evidence 11 (\"an accurate estimation of the time of death is not possible\").\n",

Presumably it belonged to Inspector Gregson...\"\n\nSince Gregson is apparently dead and not recognized by De Rousseau, let's see if his claim regarding Gregson being \"not in the park\" fits the evidence. However, the more evident contradiction is between the event the Red-Headed League organized and the testimonies by De Rousseau and De Rossi.\n\nTestimony 0: \"We 'ad more zan one thousand red-'eaded people assemble in ze park on Lime Street zat day.\" (De Rousseau)\nEvidence 1: \"Red-Headed League Article\" — An advertisement entitled 'To the Red-Headed League'.

His body appears to be tightly curled up and there's a red hairpiece on his head.\n\nOn closer analysis, the fact De Rousseau claims Gregson \"was not in the park\" is potentially contradicted by the existence of a Red Hairpiece (Evidence 5) at the crime scene, which is presumably from the Red-Headed League gathering. However, that's circumstantial.\n\nBut here's a more direct contradiction:\nTestimony 1 (De Rossi): \"But I don't recall the man in this-a photograph.

Inspector Gregson's police identification. It's the official warrant card issued to him by Scotland Yard.\"\n\nIf De Rossi and De Rousseau confiscated Gregson's identification, they must have directly interacted with him and so must recognize him, contradicting Testimony 1.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 1 and Evidence 17 directly contradict each other.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies.\n\nTestimony 0 from De Rousseau says, \"Ze man who claimed to be an inspector zat day... was definitely not zis man.\" This means De Rousseau is claiming that the person who presented himself as Inspector Gregson was NOT actually Gregson.\n\nHowever, Evidence 17, \"Inspector's Identification,\" says: \"The identification of a man claiming to be a detective inspector, confiscated by Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi. Inspector Gregson's police identification. It's the official warrant card issued to him by Scotland Yard.\"\n\nIf De Rousseau confiscated the official identification from the man and it's genuine Gregson's ID, then the man must have been Gregson himself, contradicting De Rousseau's testimony.\n",

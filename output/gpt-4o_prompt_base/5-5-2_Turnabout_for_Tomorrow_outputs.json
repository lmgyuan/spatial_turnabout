If the victim also handled the lighter, and it was designed to be a multi-functional object, the presence of Athena's prints alone cannot strictly serve as undeniable proof of her guilt without examining the lighter's transformation feature or the victim's interactions with it.\n\nThis mismatch between the evidence and the testimony is crucial:\n",

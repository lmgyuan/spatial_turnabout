Ini claims not to have been scared and mentions Mimi's costume looking \"totally normal.\" However, this contradicts with the known fact that Maya Fey was channeling at the time, wearing the robes of a spirit medium. If Mimi appeared as Ini described, she wouldn't be seen in 'normal' attire but rather in the robes typical of a spirit medium, as seen when channeled by Maya. Furthermore, according to Maya's Magatama evidence, there’s a deep, profound aura associated with channelling, indicating that a supposed encounter with a ghost should evoke a different reaction. Hence, this juxtaposition raises doubts regarding the authenticity of Ini's claims. \n\nHere's the indicated contradiction between the spiritual attributes of Maya's Magatama and Ini's testimony about seeing her sister, which lacked any impression of channeling or otherworldliness:\n",

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "The contradiction lies between Ini's testimony and the newspaper clipping. Ini claims that her sister Mimi was a fan of cars, had a special model sports car, and wouldn’t let anyone else drive it, which is why she was supposedly in the passenger seat. However, the newspaper clipping suggests that Ini was the driver because she was the one being interviewed about driving the car the night of the accident. This contradiction implies that Ini might have been the one driving and not her sister Mimi as she testified.\n",

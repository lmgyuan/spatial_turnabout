    "cot": "To determine the contradiction, we need to look at the testimonies provided by Frank Sahwit and see if they conflict with any of the evidences.\n\n1. Sahwit claims that he heard a voice saying the time coming from the television (Testimony 1).\n2. He later explains that the time was three hours off, implying a discrepancy (Testimony 2 and 3).\n3. Sahwit suggests that the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program, which is why he thought the time was 1:00 PM (Testimony 3 and 4).\n\nLet's examine the available evidence:\n\n- The Blackout Record (Evidence 4) states that electricity to Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime. This means that the television could not have been on, contradicting Sahwit's claim that he heard the time from the television.\n\nThe contradiction lies between Sahwit's testimony about the television being on and the evidence of the blackout, which makes it impossible for the television to be a source of the time. Therefore, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are:\n\nEvidence 4: Blackout Record - Electricity was out from noon to 6 PM.\nTestimony 1: Sahwit claiming the time came from the television.\n",

Sahwit's claim that he saw the time from a clock, which he associated with this object, does not match with the information about the statue, creating a contradiction between Evidence 2 (Statue) and Testimony 3 (\"That must have been what I saw.\").\n",

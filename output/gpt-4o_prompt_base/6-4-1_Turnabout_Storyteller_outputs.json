However, let's review the evidence, particularly Evidence 7: Karuta Cards which spell out \"WHET NO 4.\" There is also additional information in the evidence that states the cards originally spelt \"OWEN 4TH.\" \n\nThe contradiction lies in the fact that \"OWEN 4TH\" does not clearly refer to Bucky Whet, and the message was altered to spell \"WHET NO 4.\" This information contradicts Uendo's statement in Testimony 3, as there is no clear indication that the message originally referenced Bucky, and it was possibly altered later.\n\nThus, the contradiction can be highlighted between Uendo's testimony and the details found in Evidence 7.\n",

    "cot": "The testimony provided by Uendo where he mentions that he will never be able to live down how terribly he bombed during that very important show contradicts with the evidence that contains the Crime Scene Report. In the report, the information about the crime scene occurring in the dressing room, along with the dying message and additional information, suggests that the event in the dressing room was significant, likely affecting Uendo's performance. The fact that the victim, Master Toneido, died during the show's timeframe implies that Uendo's performance was overshadowed by this tragic event, leading to his poor reception, making it inconsistent with the notion of simply bombing the performance. Therefore, there is a contradiction present between Uendo's testimony of simply bombing and the evidence of the significant event (the crime) impacting the show.\n",

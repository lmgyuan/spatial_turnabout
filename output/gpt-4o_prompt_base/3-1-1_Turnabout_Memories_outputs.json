Specifically, Testimony 3 states that Feenie caught up with Doug and crashed into him from behind.\n\nHowever, Phoenix's Testimony (Evidence 6) states that \"The victim fell on top of his umbrella.

Furthermore, Crime Photo 1 (Evidence 2) depicts the scene with the umbrella lying flat, supporting Phoenix's Testimony that Doug fell onto the umbrella, inconsistent with a collision from behind.\n\nThus, the contradiction surfaces between Dahlia's claim of a rear collision and the description of Doug's position and Phoenix's testimony.\n",

The presence of a separating mirror is not clear from the photo, and moving the mirror would likely have shifted evidence or altered the scene significantly, a detail that the Crime Photo does not corroborate. \n\nThus, the contradiction lies in Armstrong claiming to move the mirror without affecting anything else, which conflicts with the expectation that such a move would be reflected in the captured photo of the crime scene.\n",

However, Glen's Calendar shows that Glen had a meeting with 'The Tiger' on December 3rd. This contradicts Tigre's testimony that he set up a meeting with Glen but Glen never showed because Glen's calendar explicitly mentions meeting \"The Tiger,\" who is also Tigre, implying they did meet or at least that Glen intended to. \n\nThe contradiction here is that Glen Elg had an arranged meeting with \"The Tiger\" as noted on his calendar, which suggests prior acquaintance or arrangement, while Tigre claims Glen never showed up to their meeting.

    "cot": "To identify the contradiction, we need to consider the testimonies provided by Furio Tigre and check them against the evidences. One noteworthy contradiction can be found between Tigre's testimony and Glen Elg's autopsy report.\n\nFurio Tigre's Testimony 3 states: \"I'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.\" This implies that Tigre was directly threatening or planning to harm Glen Elg at the moment. However, Glen Elg died from potassium cyanide poisoning according to his autopsy report, which conflicts with the implication that Tigre was intending to kill him by physical means (flattening him in a violent way).\n\nThe contradiction here is that Elg didn't die from physical assault but rather from poisoning, suggesting that Tigre's account of threatening violence at that moment doesn't align with the manner of the victim's death as recorded in the autopsy. \n\nTherefore, the contradiction can be established between Testimony 3 of Tigre and Evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report).\n",

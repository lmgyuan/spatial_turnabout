According to Testimony 3, Iris claims that Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise.\n\nNow, let's cross-reference this statement with the relevant pieces of evidence. According to Evidence 9, the actual weapon used to murder the victim was the Victim's Staff, which has a sword hidden inside and is consistent with the cause of death being a stab in the back. This contradicts the series of events suggested by the testimonies, particularly since Iris said Mystic Maya stabbed Elise, implying she used the Shichishito (Evidence 10). However, the Shichishito, listed in Evidence 10, is stated not to be the actual murder weapon.\n\nTherefore, there is a contradiction between Iris's testimony (that Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise) and the fact that the staff was the actual weapon used, not the Shichishito, which was only believed to be the murder weapon due to the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it.\n",

However, considering the nature of evidence and the context, there aren't specific evidence numbers listed indicating Godot being somewhere else directly on that night. Instead, the surrounding evidence indirectly indicates that events had transpired already by the time Godot arrived the following day.\n\nThe contradiction lies with the specifics of the testimony regarding Godot's first arrival and an implication that he would have needed to be present to prevent certain outcomes, such as Maya being found by Godot afterward. This suggests perhaps other people had not already been there, as the testimony may suggest otherwise about the timing.\n\nTo contradict Testimony 3 directly, it could relate back to the evidence indicating already transpired events reliant on others being present prior, such as other people being found beside Godot.\n\nGiven these dynamics, and aligning with various specifics, no singular evidence number outright shows Godot was in an area he shouldn't have been already before arriving, but contextually Evidence 7 (Weather Data) alongside other evidence seem to suggest technical implications about bridging existences needed prior, potentially contradicting the supposed nature of the testimony regarding \"cheered her right up\" as well in a way where:\n",

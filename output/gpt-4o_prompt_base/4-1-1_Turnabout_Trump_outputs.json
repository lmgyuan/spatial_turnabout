A standard poker game typically uses one deck, and the presence of specific card multiples can imply otherwise.\n\nSince both hands shown have four aces, this suggests that more than one deck is involved, which aligns with the testimony. However, considering the theory that the Bloody Ace represents a fifth Ace beyond what would be available with a standard two-deck setup shows inconsistency or implies foul play regarding the decks involved.\n\nThus, Testimony 3 claimed two decks were used; however, the Bloody Ace and the hands of cards suggest there might be additional aces than what two decks should contain, if we consider cheating was involved. Therefore the statement about two decks could be misleading in this context.\n\nBut a clear mismatch, primarily considering presence of specific fifth ace, occurs between this another testimony and the weapon:\nTestimony 5 (\"I will say I never touched the murder weapon.\") contradicted by Evidence 3, where the deadly bottle bears \"Mr. Wright's prints\".\n",

You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "The contradiction lies between Phoenix's testimony about disposing of the card \"in the bottle\" and the actual layout of the crime scene in the evidence. Phoenix says he disposed of the card in the bottle, which implies the bottle was used to hold the card or something else before it was used as a weapon. However, the crime photo (Evidence 2) shows the table with cards scattered around and a grape juice bottle, suggesting the cards were left on the table, not stored or hidden in a bottle. Additionally, the Deadly Bottle (Evidence 3) is said to be empty and was used as the murder weapon, bearing Mr. Wright's prints upside-down, which might suggest it was not simply sitting upright and holding something like a card. This indicates a discrepancy over where or how the card was supposedly hidden or disposed of.\n",

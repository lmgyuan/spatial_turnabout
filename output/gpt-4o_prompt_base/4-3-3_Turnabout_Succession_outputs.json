You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "To identify a contradiction, we need to find a piece of evidence that directly contradicts one of the testimonies. In Testimony 4, Detective Gumshoe claims \"And the pistol definitely belonged to the old man, sir!\" This statement suggests that the ownership of the pistol is clear and explicitly linked to the victim. However, upon examining the contents of the evidence section, the Stage Pistol (Evidence 20) description only mentions that it is capable of firing one real bullet and that rifling marks match the bullet found in the victim. Importantly, it also states that no fingerprints were found on it, which could potentially imply uncertainty or dispute over who actually owned or used the pistol. This lack of identifiable ownership or prints on the pistol contradicts Gumshoe's certainty regarding its ownership. \n\nThus, pairing Gumshoe's Testimony 4 with Evidence 20 makes a logical contradiction. \n",

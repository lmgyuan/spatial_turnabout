The contradiction lies between Lotta's deposition, which states that she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25 (Evidence 11), and Larry Butz's testimony indicating that he only heard a single gunshot before going home (Testimony 5). 

The evidence suggests there were two shots fired, while the testimony only acknowledges one, presenting a clear inconsistency.

******************************
The evidence that contradicts the testimony is Evidence 11, which states that Lotta Hart heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. This contradicts Testimony 3 from Larry Butz, who claims he heard a gunshot just when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" on Christmas Eve. However, the two sounds that Lotta heard indicate there were actually two gunshots heard after midnight, conflicting with Butz's single gunshot claim being heard earlier at the precise moment mentioned.

The evidence that contradicts a testimony is the "Iris's Testimony" (Testimony 12) which states that Iris rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered. This contradicts Bikini's Testimony (Testimony 3), where she indicates that Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed as she had been at dinner, implying that Iris was not in her room at the time of the murder discovery, which is after the lights out bell rang.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}
******************************
The testimony from Bikini states, "Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on." This contradicts the evidence of Iris's Hood, which is described as being worn at all times and said to offer protection from evil spirits. If Iris typically wears her hood, it would be unusual for her to not have it on. 

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
******************************
The evidence that contradicts the testimony is the "Elise's Autopsy Report" (Evidence 11) stating that the cause of death was a stab in the back, while Bikini's testimony (Testimony 5) claims she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Mystic Elise through the back. However, there is an inconsistency since other testimonies from Bikini suggest she fainted and then claims to have not seen the stabbing firsthand, which raises doubts about her reliability.

Therefore, the conflicting evidence and testimony pair is:
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
******************************
The testimony from Bikini states that she saw tracks indicating a snowmobile had been used, and that it takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 minutes using a snowmobile. However, if the snowmobile was used, it raises a question about how the murder weapon was discarded into Eagle River as per her statement that maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River after the murder. This contradicts the logistical timing of her observations.

The evidence regarding the victim's staff states it had fingerprints on it, indicating it was handled by someone. If it was discarded into the river as implied in Bikini's testimony, it would not have been handled as much or left behind. 

Given this contradiction, one clear pair is: 

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 4}
******************************
The contradiction lies between Testimony 0 and Evidence 7. Testimony 0 states that Butz went to the shack around 9 PM, implying he was there until around 10:30 PM. However, Evidence 7 indicates that around that time, the weather was snowy with lightning, and lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. This timing contradicts his account, as he would not have been able to arrive at the bridge shortly after 10:30 PM without witnessing the lightning strike.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 0}
******************************
The evidence that suggests the weather conditions during the crime was snowy with occasional lightning strikes (Evidence 7 - Weather Data) contradicts Larry Butz's testimony that he saw Iris flying while her white hood was fluttering (Testimony 2). Given that the weather was snowy, the visibility would not typically be favorable for such an observation, suggesting this was likely fabricated or exaggerated. 

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 2}

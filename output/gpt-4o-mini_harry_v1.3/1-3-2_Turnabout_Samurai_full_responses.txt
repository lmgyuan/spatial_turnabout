The evidence that contradicts the testimony is the "Powers'(?) Photo" (Evidence 5) and "I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!" (Testimony 4). If Oldbag was at the main gate the entire time from 1:00 PM until 5:00 PM, then she could not have accurately seen Powers at 2:00 PM heading toward the studio. This creates a contradiction since the photo indicates Powers was near the gate and heading towards the studio around that time.

******************************
The testimony by Oldbag stating "The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!" contradicts the evidence that states "Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM." This suggests that no one could have accessed the scene during that time. Since the time of death is confirmed to be at 2:30 PM, it means that if Oldbag did not see anyone else, including Will Powers, after the obstruction was in place, it contradicts her statement.

The evidence that contradicts one of the testimonies is the "Sacred Urn" (Evidence 4). It is described as supposedly priceless but having no monetary value, which raises questions about why Mask☆DeMasque, who targets the most precious pieces, would be interested in stealing it. 

This contradicts Testimony 3, which states that Mask☆DeMasque always goes after the most precious art pieces. The claim that he targets only the most valuable items does not align with the nature of the Sacred Urn.

******************************
The testimony by Luke Atmey states that he was struck by Mask☆DeMasque at approximately 1 o'clock in the morning and lost consciousness immediately, not being able to land a single strike. However, the autopsy report of Kane Bullard indicates that his time of death was at 1 AM, which would suggest he was already dead at the time Atmey was attacked. This creates a contradiction because if Atmey was attacked at 1 AM, it would be impossible for Kane to have already died at this exact time. Therefore, the evidence contradicts Atmey's testimony.

******************************
The testimony states that Luke Atmey was rendered senseless by the thief grabbing a weapon from the side and striking him. However, Evidence 6 indicates that the Shichishito (the ceremonial sword) was not bent before the crime, implying that it was not used as a weapon in the way Atmey described during the incident. The evidence suggests that the weapon used could not have been the Shichishito since it remained unharmed, contradicting Atmey's claim.

******************************
The contradiction lies between the evidence of the Security Camera Photo (Evidence 9) and Ron's Testimony (Testimony 2). Ron claims he does not have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, which contradicts evidence that could show him at the scene of the crime if the camera captured his presence. If he was indeed Mask☆DeMasque at the time, the photo could either confirm his presence or show that he is lying about his actions during that time.

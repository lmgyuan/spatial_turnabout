The evidence that contradicts the testimony is the "Receipt" (Evidence 3) and the statement that "there was blood found on the victim's finger" (Testimony 4) by Gumshoe. The receipt indicates that a glass light stand was purchased the day before the murder, which suggests that the murder weapon was prepared or involved previously. However, the idea that the victim wrote the murderer's name in blood suggests a more direct connection to the murder at the time of the attack, which creates a discrepancy regarding the timing and condition of the victim's injuries and actions.

******************************
The evidence that contradicts the testimony is the Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 3 (April's statement that Maya hit the victim with the weapon). The autopsy report states that Mia died from a single blunt force trauma, indicating she was not conscious after being struck. If April's testimony is taken as true, it suggests that Mia was still capable of dodging and running before the attack, which does not align with the autopsy findings.
